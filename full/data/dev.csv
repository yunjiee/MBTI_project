istp,from what i  ve read   <type>s can sometimes suddenly act cold or be mean in order to test if the person can keep up with their quirks or that they  ll really stay i was wondering if <type>s ever do this as well i m still parsing through what happened with my relationship with my <type> ex and he went hot cold   jerkoff upstanding gentleman and back again a couple times it seemed the super cold and the super hot would both be sudden i e please do n t go   you  re the best to get out   i do n t have feelings from you and even months later i m like what    also   do <type>s think about old relationships at all    i resent the idea that i still think about it while he bounces around happily

enfj,greeting <type>s   i  ve read several threads about how awesome <type>s are and how well you get along with <type>s however   i can not say that this matches my experience with my <type> he  s clearly become a very unhealthy <type> i m now sure how to help him become healthy   if anything he  s somewhat manipulative   overly critical    likes to discourage instead of encourage      and he  s pretty defensive whenever he is confronted about these things as you can assume   these actions have effected me as he used to be an amazing person i do n t know what happened to cause him to start acting this way   but if anyone has any insight as to why this could occur or what i can do to help him   it would be grateful appreciated i read somewhere that <type>s love verbal affirmation   so i  ve been trying to give him a lot lately however   whenever i do   he does n t accept my compliments by saying something like no   i m not i m thinking that he could possibly have low self esteem    it  s also worth nothing that he does seem to have low possible underdeveloped intuition he  s certainly an <type> as he  s tested that way and he certainly has xnfx feelings    as i m <type>   i  d know    he  s a very strong judger and feeler though like i said previously   because of his hurtful behavior   this friend of mine is starting to become toxic and hard to be around so if any of you have any ideas of what i can possibly do to help him   i  d greatly appreciate it

istj,so i continue to chug away at dating i go on dates and none of them end up badly with her storming off or tossing a drink at me but i just constantly get the no chemistry not feeling it the thing is i never feel this instant lightning bolt spark type reaction it is more like i am attracted which is n t a big thing i am attracted to about    of women in my age race bracket as i get to know them as a person it builds more and more and i start getting a picture of building a life together how was it when you fell in love    was it like an instant spark

enfp,here s for when i    or maybe you    need this thread please feel free to contribute 
enfp,okay   so i just broke up with my boyfriend    it was mutual aka we were having issues and he talked me into breaking up    and right now i just have this hollow feeling in the pit of my stomach but i have n t actually reacted to it yet   how do you    as <type>s    react to breakups    
entp,ok so i met this guy that i believe to be an <type> on tinder by the second time we went out for dinner   i felt insane chemistry and connections with him then few days after   we ran into each other again at a bar    actually he knew i was gonna be there and told me he and his friends might hit up the same place so when he did come later that night   i went downstairs    lower floor of the bar    to say hi   and we ended up dancing and leaving the bar together and hooked up    booze involved of course    that night while we stayed together i kind of let on that i hadn t done it    the deed    for a long time   and i wasn t sure if he got the hint that this sort of impromptu hookup isn t actually something i typically do but anyways we had a pretty great night the next day when we were about to part ways i only quickly hugged him while saying goodbye   then just went downstairs to the subway station    cuz he seemed to be in a rush to go meet his cousin for brunch as they had planned it beforehand    but later that night he texted to check in we briefly exchanged a few texts the next day we texted again and i asked him if he d like to meet in the next few days as i will be out of the town over the weekend he told me sure but since his cousin is still visiting    from another country      he wasn t sure when he would be available upon hearing that i told him it s ok i ll just let you hang out with your cousin then   no worries   or we could play it by ear he said ok he will let me know if he s not doing anything with him however i just never heard from him again for the rest of the week the following week i texted him again asking how he was and if he s still hanging out with the cousin he replied and told me yes and now his boss is also in town attending a surgery conference we briefly exchanged a few more texts again and i just left it there because i didn t want to bother him also at the time i didn t have a good feeling about where this was going and thought he probably wanted to end things already and withdrew however   few days later   he texted me again telling me that he d been busy taking his boss around touring    his boss flew from the u s    and just got back from the gorge    a famous scenic spot in my country which is fairly far away from the city    then he told me that he has to fly back to the u s for a job interview for a few days   but maybe we can hang out next week after he s back i told him ok let me know then we did not contact each other for the following week as again i did not want to bother him   since i assumed he would be busy preparing for having the interview   plus visiting family friends and stuff a week later he did text me again   but told me that he kind of met someone on the plane that he has a pretty good connections with   so he would like to see where that goes and he typically doesn t like to get involved with multiple people at the same time   so if we meet it has to be totally as regular friends i was too upset upon hearing that so i did not respond at all few days after i calmed down   i figured maybe i should still respond out of politeness since he at least wasn t trying to string me along so i texted back   and that was already two weeks later   first thanking him for being upfront with me i told him it wasn t something i was happy to hear   but i do appreciate his honesty   and that we could totally stay friends and maybe hang out later when we have time also i wish things are going well for him he replied by first thanking me too and saying that ok maybe he can tell me his untold story if we hang out haha    the story he said he will tell me later when we had dinner before    i said ok   and that was it it s been two months   honestly i was so hurt because i really like this guy and i have a hard time believing he would have a stronger connection with someone that he just randomly met on the plane that he s willing to just drop me like that and choose to proceed with her i have been trying to keep myself busy and move on because i thought his behavior after we spent the night together and the things he said had all made it clear he has no interest in taking things further or even getting to know me better sometimes i thought i ve felt better after this amount of time passed   but somehow recently i ve been itching to reach out to him   because as i said above i just have a hard time believing he did not feel the same level of connections chemistry we had as i did and i really was just caught up by my own fantasy wishful thinking i ve been suppressing the urge to text him but i feel i couldn t withhold it any longer could some fellow <type> guys shed some light on this    and what s your take on me reaching out to him at this point       we have not contacted each other at all over the past two months    one thing i did think about is that although i believe my behaviors should be quite telling that i am into him   i never confessed my feeling to him nor did we talk about any relationship stuff during the time we spent together    we did have some raw revelation about ourselves that s why i thought we had a connection      because to me it was also too early to talk about that kind of stuff since we d only met for three times   but i actually wanted to get to know him and was interested in exploring a relationship with him    we are both in our thirties so of course i am looking for a possible long term mate    i just never had a chance to convey those thoughts to him because things happened too quickly and he probably has no idea i ve been experiencing so much emotional turmoil during this time because you know   as an infx type   we are usually not too gushy at the beginning and we like to give people space and not to be bothersome    that s also why after we spent the night together i didn t initiate text contact much either because i wasn t sure what he wanted    do you think i still have a chance with him    what s the best course of action i should take right now    just continue to try to move on    and could anybody help explain his behavior to me    if he just saw it as a casual fling   why did he still bother to stay or even initiate contact with me afterwards    was it because he knew he wasn t ready to take things further but actually likes and respects me as a person enough so he would rather be upfront with me than hurting me even more down the road   hence the initiation of contact but suggestion of hanging out as friends    or is it purely just a form of polite rejection    also   do you think it  s possible that he felt the pressure of commitment after sex so he spooked and wanted to jump right back into the dating game upon first opportunity presented    the lady on the plane       thanks in advance and sorry for the long post frustrating i am a newbie here although i ve been lurking for a while roud another thing to add is i could sometimes come off as an outgoing   live in the present   go with the flow kind of extrovert if you have n t known me well enough   as i am a people person and know how to have fun when the time is right so could there be a slight possibility that he thought i was also just looking for some fun    
isfj,list some of your favorite movies and explain why   amelie cinematography i love the quirky yet simple plot   and the quick pace through the movie this movie is the epitome of eye sensory satisfaction   the color purple always one of my favorites   even as a young girl it  s the heart wrenching tear jerker that really shakes my emotions to the core   the jerk i tend to love simple   stupid humor    like dumb and dumber    because there is nothing to absorb at a sensory level 
estj,why all the hate for <type>s    i do n t know all the lingo so forgive my uneducated thoughts years ago i found the online test and was amazed at how accurate it was for me i had    okay truth is i originally wrote made and automatically was like damn this is n t helping the case but they had fun whatever    my family and friends take it   was a fun time over the years i  ve retaken the test to see if i  ve changed and other than a closing gap from extroverted to introverted everything  s pretty much stayed the same i have an <type> mother and sister an <type> father and <type> partner for    years our family has its troubles like most but i m the glue that keeps our family together    my immediate family   my partner is another post haha    i talk to my mom like multiple times a day and while i find things about her extremely frustrating we are very close we both just care enough about each other to work through it personality types aside i consider myself to be an empath like   i m not emotional about my own feelings often but someone else  s grief will overwhelm me could be a complete stranger   in a moment i can put myself in their shoes and become a blubbering mess trying to process their sadness grief i have close friends who i like to think greatly enjoy my company and i  ve never had issues making friends in new places   often these people will seek me out or make some statement that i m such a trustworthy   honest   fun person to be around coworkers know i  ll lighten the mood and generally make work a fun place    not just by doing more than my fair share    i can absolutely be domineering and its something i struggle with   because i find it hard to let go of control    i m just so good at quickly coming up with the best   most logical plan to execute things with no detail forgotten    but i am adamant about admitting my wrongs if i m wrong i will genuinely   directly admit it now i hate getting chastised when i am wrong   but understand those that are inferior need to shoot their shot on the rare occasion they can i get that scratching the surface of us being bossy   especially as a woman   but i am a caring   kind person who genuinely tries to help people   i live for those in my circle and would do anything for them my kid is my world and i want a laid back parental relationship with him where he can tell me anything i try desperately to be a crunchy mom   i try to suppress initial reactions to things fostered by society so he can just be him    thinking along the lines of letting a boy wear a dress or play with dolls    i  d love to think i m just not an <type>   with all the negative opinions i  ve read from other types   it would be an easy way out   but i know its not true so if you  ve made it this far   what  s the deal    
estj,what do <type>s think of <type>s    personally   i really like <type>s they are very hardworking   strong   confident   organized   proper and reliable they also have a gentle and kind side   
infp,it  s a bit shocking to me how rapidly and meaningfully public discourse has changed in the past couple of years regarding unidentified objects in the sky with the revelation of programs like aatip in the u s and military sensor data being released into the public while it  s still unclear what we  re seeing in the sky it has become increasingly clear that there is something actually being seen   it  s no longer hillbillies and stories now it  s military officers and civilian pilots with recordings on advanced sensor systems we  ve even seen the former head of the israeli space agency come forward with some albeit fantastical tales   but i m stumped as to what would motivate him to lie about this why would someone who spent decades as a decorated military officer and subsequent architect and leader of their nations space program burn their legacy to the ground    though i  ll acknowledge that his assertions are really hard to accept now we even have mainstream news treating the subject with some degree of seriousness for the first time since the sixties this was released just today i think i have no idea what the ship recorded   but it was n t swamp gas or a weather balloon   and if it is a drone who is making drones with technology decades or more in advance of the best the world has to offer    what are we seeing    and why has a government who has spent decades stifling an issue now reversed course entirely    thoughts    
entp,hi all people it is about that the truth about mbti first post discussing intelligence and type if we 
isfj,congregate here <type> men tell me about yourselves 
esfp,dating an <type> for almost two months has been challenging but there  s also psychological understanding and attraction between us so it is n t one sided when we talk about hobbies   arts   and places it can be extremely comfortable and enjoyable however   i m not truly sure if this young man wants to be serious with me we are only in our early twenties and i do n t have that much experience in the dating world except with this young <type> who has at least   lovers before me he told me that he wanted to consider me as his wife unless i fulfilled his criteria which obviously has to be about looks and body i told him that these are superficial things and that in the end   looks will merely fade i understand it can be an important factor especially if he is truly visual and i m sure even without me   he can get another lady if he desires to if he had someone with whom he went out before and he is comparing me with those women   then i just do n t understand the idea of him being with me if he knows i ca n t satisfy his wishes sometimes if i can recall   at least we clashed but manage to forgive each other until there will be another conflict if we are already like this during dating   i do n t know if marriage is the best solution since it wo n t be the same usually   dating is supposed to be easier   i thought well   not in this relationship lol i was anticipating this relationship to last long term and i know i should n t expect anything too much   but after going through hardships i had a chance to move on and not fall for another heartbreak if marriage is uttered in his tongue   i believe he wants to respect me and be frank about the situation so   i m not sure why he always cancels our plan if we want to have a date and talk about serious matters oh   i do n t know we  ll see 
entj,hi peeps   fellow <type> here i need some practical advice regarding some work issues i am facing at work with my manager for me   i often can see the inefficiency in things and try to change the way of doing certain things at work to make things more efficient my manager sees it differently and prefer to do things the same way he has been doing things the thing is   i feel both of us are not wrong it is just that i am an overachiever and tend to want to do things the best i could yet my manager prefer to do things just good enough   and value efficiency over quality   as such he can complete things in just   to   days   but i am requesting for a week to complete   which he declined my proposal the thing is   the deadline is still far   and there are ample time to do things and don t understand why is he rushing me to do things his way i have even highlighted this issue with him   but the answer i got from him is by far   vague in fact   i m still unsure why he made such a decision the reason why i need a week to do things because i am an industrial designer   and i want to elevate my company product quality as much as possible   and often require time to think of innovative ways to find solutions to create great products   but because my manager just wants things good enough and value efficiency   therefore he expect me to do the same and give me the same deadline   which i can t   because like i say   i want to create really great products for the company and humankind to be honest   which require time to think again   i have tried addressing his concern and tells him i have a different agenda compare to him   and that the deadline is still far   i don t see the issue of needing to rush and prompted him to let me try my method of doing things at last   he dictated me to follow his method i am at the point i feel like resigning   as this is not once i have such communication breakdown with him and only to have him dictating me i have tried to just be a good follower and do whatever my manager says without questioning but i feel dead inside   as if my work has no purpose and i am doing just for the paycheque eventually   i decided to be clear with my agenda   which is actually beneficial to the company therefore i have many conflict yet the manager cannot find a reason to fire me   because he has to explain to my director because i didn t do anything wrong   he cannot just report to the director regarding the issues that is happening between us the reason why i feel like resigning because first i find it difficult to work with a manager that makes inefficient decision and there is nothing i can do about it and have to do work that i do not believe in the first place such torture is something i have to accept if i continue working here    i just have an realisation writing this lol    i wonder what will fellow <type> do here feel free to be direct and criticise me if there is anything i have done wrongly if you need me to explain the situation in deeper detail   feel free to ask as i intend to keep this post short thanks in advance   
intj,i feel stupid   ugly   or at the very least mediocre there are times when i skip class simply because i m not feeling attractive i m in deep pain i ca n t bear to accept the idea that i m not someone remarkable or exceptional the idea that i may never be relevant in the grand scheme of things it  s been putting me off doing a lot of things   from working on my songs to attending college classes my self esteem is devastated   nothing seems good enough for me i also no longer see the point in participating in college classes to have a mediocre job with a mediocre life i really want to grow in the musical and artistic field be someone inspiring and eccentric and disclose all my artistic potential of course   i m not going to stop doing these things completely   as i still believe in the possibility that i can create something beautiful and inspiring i will continue with all my remaining strength to aim at intellectual and artistic development but the fact that i am already    years old and still have n t done anything that relevant leaves me in a state of deep melancholy   since when i do   it will only be considered a   good job for my age     not   a work of a young prodigy with great potential   how can i get around this inconceivable desire to want to be something so phenomenal that is making me give up on life    does anyone have a point of view that might comfort me    am i just in some kind of addiction or mindless pursuit of admiration    or in terms of typology am i repressing my se or something    a ni fi loop perhaps    
intj,<type> here met this <type> online and we clicked real fast the chemistry was instantaneous then we started talking on the phone he used to call me every single day and keep me on the phone for hours he used to text me every single day as well i am suppose to meet him in real life later this summer in the beginning he was very direct and clear and said that he wants to actively meet and date me   and i concurred two months into knowing each other   he sent me a heartfelt message saying he  s never had a such a quick depthy connection with someone before in his life and how much he loves our connection   and he told me it  s hard for him to say this to someone however   all of a sudden he became really distant and stopped talking to me so i directly sent him a message and asked him what  s up    are you no longer interested or something    how come i never hear from you anymore    i even asked him on two separate occasions if he  s seeing someone right now and he does n t feel right talking to me   he needs to tell me because i do n t like talking to guys who are already seeing someone else   and he said it  s not the case he said that he  s been working a lot   his living situation is hell   his back is hurting him   etc what is strange is that i see him logged on facebook a lot he shows as active on my messenger app he sure is sooo busy   i m getting honestly worried and anxious   and i m not sure if i should take his word for it why he does n t talk to me anymore we grew very close to each other   it does n t make sense for him to stop talking to me all of a sudden did i get boring to him    why is he so quiet all of a sudden    what could be the reason    he could n t get enough of me for two months straight 
intj,there  s a thread like this in the <type> forum   and i thought it would be beneficial here it might help clear up some preconceived notions and stereotypes of <type>  s while also reducing some unnecessary threads so here   any type can ask a question any <type> can answer but remember   we are people too mellow we eat   sleep   and piss like everyone else so ask away   
enfj,case closed no more opinions are required thanks for all your input    
intp,well   i  ve seen these threads on about   different forums   so i guess i m stealing it from all those basically   post things that interest entertain you    not that kind of entertainment    i m confident that my fellow <type>s will come up with some interesting things i  ll start interesting mechanisms   this one  s used in watches for second hands   this one was used in aircraft engines before turbines   i do n t even know what this one  s for   this one  s used in sewing machines   this one  s called a constant velocity joint what    and finally   the wankel engine i do n t even really think this one  s physically possible so   <type>s   what turns you on    
istp,has anyone here ever started their own successful business   and could share some insights       definition of success in this scenario would be making enough money to be self sufficient    i have been thinking about starting my own business for a long time now i know there would be particular struggles for the <type> personality   but i feel like the pros would outweigh the cons pros you are your own boss   which means nobody breathing down your neck and micro managing you you get to choose the work you do and the clients you take on    within reason    you can make your own hours and take holidays when you like    this can be tricky if you start getting busy and have a backlog of work however   given enough notice   i m sure clients would understand after all   everyone needs time away    you are in full control of the marketing   prices   accounting bookkeeping   scope of work   etc when growing   you get to choose who to hire to work in your business cons no job security will be tough sledding until you get a few clients and find some momentum    some people are n t comfortable with this   but i think <type> is well suited to this unpredictability    a lot of work hours    although most would see this as a con   i find this intriguing if you  re doing meaningful work    liabilities that come with running a business    threat of being sued   bad customers   online complaints bad reviews   etc    i  ve worked in the corporate world now for    yrs at several different companies   and i feel like it  s mostly designed for extroverted types who can do endless amounts of people pleasing and managerial ass kissing the exception would be if you could specialize in one particular area and be the best at what you do however   i have a thirst for various experiences and a dynamic   ever changing environment i have many more thoughts on the topic   and look forward to engaging with some of you humans on the matter   
enfp,paradox of me i believe in   dignity   character   virtue   and conviction i believe that   kindness can be your strenght   creativity can be made real   making values into rules of laws justice is my core   tight rein on my intuition   running inside me   as my very source of essence when the times comes   i will do whatever it takes   i will set the wrong right   leading a rebellion violence hurts me   evil offends me   i can either choose   not to see it   or feel the weight of it i am soft marshmallow   clad in the strongest armour   filled with verocity and conviction i am kind but dangerous   i am affectionate but hard core   free   yet self discipline when i am angry   get out of my way   i will be your deadly natural disaster if you are lucky   i will find reason to forgive you   that  s the paradox of me nikisan          
entp,hi first time post   i  dont really expect anybody to understand what the heck i was trying to do or understand my actions but hopefully somebody can give me some advice on how i can fix this and english is not my main lang i m a <type> and i did n t figure this out until couple of months ago so i have never heard about personalities or done any research on it this is my story i m gonna try to keep it short it started when i was really young   in the beginning of my     s i started to date   girls at the same time    had sexual relationship with both      and i ended up with one of them into a full time relationship and moved in with her the other girl    she is a <type> which i did figure out recently      i did still keep contact with the other one but only couple of times a month at best my main problem is how to deal and move on with the girl that is a <type> from the very start she knew that i was dating a other girl she knew that i still am in a relationship i did not have sex with her expect from in the beginning which is now almost    years ago so the years past by and i did have contact with her we both love to talk to each other and we understand each other perfectly i did visit her couple of times    maybe     times tops in a year      we went out and had great time i mean   it was fucking awesome we went to a bar and we went there to get something to eat none of us had time to even read the meny so we always ended up with not eating anything that feeling when time just pass by in a split of a second   it always felt like magic it did feel like a date   every single time and at the end she did kiss me    we did n t have sex for    years and she never invited me home in the last years    i know that for a fact that she was in love in me at some point so i told her that we could t be together because it wo n t fit at this point of our life we both had a huge mess in our life   it was like a disaster she did agree in my head   i wanted to keep her whatever the price it would be i love every single second that i m with her but for my part   it could be just like a great friend somebody that would be around with me for the rest of my life   somebody who can take on my bullshit she is the kind of girl that i could go out and pick up boys and girls for both me and her   lol   just for fun obv   recently everytime i was there to visit her   she started to make up things to avoid to meet me i do n t mean those normal things like i  have a headache   ca n t meet you it looked like a game of power sort of thing i asked her first if she was avaiable on friday and she said yes and wanted to meet me so i bought tickets to a stand up show   and i thought we both needed something to laugh of and the thursday comes   she said me this msg i do n t like that you did n t ask me if i could be out that late   i just wanna ditch the hole thing now yeah   she had work next day   but it was never a problem before we always did hangout late   work or whatever did n t matter i do n t have those msgs anymore   but in most of them she is attacking i do n t understand why like if i did n t respect her or something like that so i got really pissed because it did happend couple of times and it fucking exploded   and now she wo n t talk to me at all we had this huge fight   i mean she wo n t give me any answer on what she wanted and expected from me i told her   just be straight with me i did push her so far that either you will do it   or yeah   she blocked me now none of this made any sense in my head   nothing it never happend before   even when she was in a relationship just to make it clear i  can be a fucking asshole   i  can be a douchebag but not vs this one never   i was really straight with her about my feelings   thoughts and action i was really trying to make her days and mine better   and i was trying to improve on every single lvl she also did make me a better person overall she also loved every single time we went out i was always trying to find something new to do like not even for a date   but as exp in life in general things that we hav n t done before summary of our relationship we could never figure out what we had   but whatever the heck we do have it  was great   it was beyong awesome and this happend out of nowhere i m stuck dunno what to do now    is it really that simple    she was just in love with me and she knew that we could n t be together    
estj,how would i do this    winning the argument itself with facts is not a problem the problem is to get them to acknowledge defeat and stop trying to use transference with logical fallacies and ambiguous phrasing my step dad is <type> and we get into petty arguments a lot when i prove him wrong he will respond with one of several things total silence as if the argument never occurred eventually he might say i do n t have time to talk about this right now   repetition of something that asserts his position of power over me    ex it  s my house        or repetition of his original position which has been defeated a logical fallacy   usually a straw man or ad hominem he also has this way of phrasing statements as questions so that my only possible response can be in answer form   not counter argument form it is very hard to explain so i will just save it basically   what is the most effective way of getting an arrogant <type> to realize and admit they are wrong    i need tactics   strategies what has worked on you in the past       this is assuming there are   ironically   <type> using internet forums    
esfp,idk if this the right space to say it but i m also delaing with the same i  ve major depression and dealing with suicidal thoughts lioe nearly everyday i feel suicidal i m feeling everything negative nothing gives me joy anymore i feel life has nothing to offer alot of bad stuff happened with me in the past that i m still not able to get over with i lost my mom last year due to cancer also i had some career issues in the past im not liking my current environment and not able to accept the changes around me everything feels dull it feels like a major part of me is lost somewhere i was diagnosed with adjustment disorder in the past also i  ve major depression so i feel very agitated and irritated and impulsive it feels like things arent going my way   things are not happening in my favour i still feel angry for whatever happened in my life i m not able to process th grief idk how do i go with life i also tried therapies before but nothing worked out i lost all hope everything seems pointless to me life is n t making sense to me also i feel worthless and do n t like myself i did alot of mistakes in my past that i still regret alot i feel no urge to live i do n t know but i do n t feel any reason to live i feel angry everyday and feel aggressive idk what to do    
esfj,i started an <type> blog if anyone is interested anyway   for real such a dumb stereotype   i think this is the stereotype that has bothered me the most   because i can t see the truth in it in contrary of other stereotypes i mean   since when does extroverted feeling evil bitch          i ve seen <type> s hate threads   i ain t kidding so many people    looking at you   inxx s    tend to type the mean girls who picked up on you in school as <type> without thinking much while not considering he actual behvaior is that really <type>   or just unhealthy    it seems like emotional   whiny   annoying bitches are typed as <type> while cold   angry and basically evil bitches are typed as <type> however   i noticed that many times <type>s really aren t the mean girl quite the contrary   they might even be nerds my first example is myself   an <type> let me say this i was never bullied but as a kid   i didn t really liked anyone and i preferred to be alone i was quite socially avoidant actually as i grew up i opened up and now while i have many friends    both close and not so close    i wouldn t classify myself as popular   while more well liked probably though let me tell you this i don t like going out to parties like <type>s might do   i enjoy staying at home watching american horror story and parks and recreation i like it when friends come over   i like it when they don t i don t depend on social interaction and definitely not on being mean and making sure my reputation still has queen b written on it i have another <type> friend who s just like me   and all she does is watching law order svu and meeting mainly with her boyfriend she doesn t care for social events or status one bit but to tell you the truth on why i m not a popular girl    because my friends are the outcasts   the weirdos yep   me   an <type>   befriending the weird kids i ll tell you why other than the fact they re interesting as shit   all of my friends are pretty troubled they have deep problems   while i don t and what i do    i help <type>s generally enjoy helping others and i m an extreme mother hen to everyone around me i enjoy helping them   fixing them   and if that means giving up status   so be it but if i m not enough   let me provide you with some more examples melanie moretti from the show hot in cleveland    a show you probably don t watch but you should if you want to see some non stereotypical <type> s   as joy is definitely not a stereotypical <type> as well   but that s for another post    anyway   melanie is blatantly <type> leads with extrovert feeling   a care for the group and being kind and polite paried with introverted sensing which causes her to be detail oriented   freak out over the unknown and rely on her experience if you ve ever watched the show   you d notice she constantly references her high school experience   which wasn t very good she suffered from all kind of physical diseases   was teased about it and was the subject of gossip among her peers   and when it was time for her prom what did she do    she stayed home with her mom and played scrabbles not something you d expect from an <type>   right    but you know   bullying happens to <type>s too   not only inxx s anyone here remembers the show victorious    tori was also an <type> definitely not a mean girl probably one of the nicest girls out there creative as well   a very good example of how an <type> in real life would look like   actually on the other hand   who is the mean girl    jade   interestingly an <type> talking about <type> x <type> pairs come on   how can you say leslie can be a mean girl    i d say april   an <type>   is a lot meaner not to be a bitch to <type>s    they re honestly my best friends      but i m just making a point <type>s in general really isn t a popular mean girl stereotype more examples are mia thermopolis from princess diaries    she s had pretty much one friend during high school and was unpopular      bernadette rostenkowski from the big bang theory    was probably more of a nerd rather than popular   especially when compared to penny   an <type>      jenna from    going on       wasn t that how the movie started         and a lot more of course   there s always the regina georges and gretchen wieners s   but what type doesn t    any mbti type when unhealthy is a mean girl why is <type> any different    
isfj,o o i m a   and test as <type> but i see a ton of similarities between me and <type>s what would be the difference between an <type> and an <type>    i am confident in my ability to just figure things out as i go along   i m messy and disorganized   but like to have a goal to concentrate efforts on do n t really have detailed plans or to do lists and i do n t make plans for the next day or anything rules bother me   being told what to do bothers me as well i also do n t like it if i have to take care of someone else imo people should learn to handle themselves   but will help despite this o o details kinda bother me   i just want the big picture or the bottom line so i know what i m dealing with before i address any details details kinda frustrate me especially if there is no end to it other then that pretty much <type> 
istp,okay i stole from the <type>s who stole it from <type>s who stole it from <type>s post pics of things you like that are <type> related what <type> would n t like to be alone and far away    every <type> has their car bike engine powered thing of choice i happen to like volvo c    s and yamaha xt     s
isfj,there seemed to be some pushback when i posted a similar list by susan storm on the <type> forum no one should take this list verbatim if anything   there may be another list posted in another forum where you can compare and contrast the differences and similarities based on ms storm  s assessment   you crave a sense of continuity knowing what to expect in life is crucial to you as an <type> having a plan   routine   and structure for your day gives you a sense of peace and frees up your mind to focus on more exciting things you naturally create routines   pleasant rituals   and habits that make your life feel dependable and positive   you have an extraordinary sense of responsibility it s vital to you to follow through on what you ve said you will do your word isn t given lightly   and when you make a commitment it s held close to your heart you believe in loyalty   reliability   and selflessness and try to emulate this in your life   you experience the present through filters of your past almost instantaneously   you make comparisons between what s happening now and what happened in the past you tend to see patterns because of this   and readily notice when an action doesn t fit the pattern you ll quickly notice when someone s body language changes   when their tone of voice changes   or even when a room has been re decorated in a minor way this is because you are constantly making comparisons and noticing when there s an aberration in the overall pattern   you enjoy creating traditions and pleasing rituals whether you re re creating your grandmother s best chocolate chip cookie recipe or celebrating the winter s solstice by lighting a candle and listening to your favorite songs   traditions are close to your heart you naturally create pleasant rituals and enjoy revisiting them year after year to commemorate special moments in your life   you replay the past in vivid detail you have a vivid and rich internal memory and you enjoy recalling beautiful memories regularly re experiencing your favorite memories can get you into a state of flow and can remind you of the events that have made life worth living at the same time   you can also replay negative past experiences in vivid detail you might lie awake in bed at night replaying about something embarrassing you did in junior high or a relationship blunder you regret it s crucial for you to learn to forgive yourself for past mistakes so that you don t get wrapped up in a cycle of punishing yourself for them   you have nuanced inner body sensations you tend to notice inner body signals very quickly this can mean noticing symptoms of sickness earlier than other types or tasting nuances in flavors that others miss because you re so sensitive to inner body sensations   you prioritize getting enough sleep   eating at consistent times   and taking care of yourself physically   you thrive when you can do detail oriented projects alone whether you re knitting a sweater   carving   cooking   or weeding your garden   you enjoy being alone to really immerse yourself in the details of something when you can tune out all the noise of the outer world and really delve into a project in depth you experience a calming sense of satisfaction   you have favorite tv shows you ll never tire of re watching maybe you have a doctor who marathon every summer or a gilmore girls party every fall whatever it is   there s probably a book or television series that you watch annually because it puts you in a particular mood and helps you commemorate a tradition that brings you joy or makes you laugh   you have a strong sense of what you should or should not do you are guided by your values and regularly assess your actions to see if they re lining up with what your conscience is telling you a sense of should or should not guides you and influences the actions you take you put a lot of thought into your decisions to see if the consequences will be things you can be proud of    you love good vibes creating a relaxed   optimistic atmosphere is something that brings you a lot of joy you enjoy swapping jokes and interesting stories with your friends   making your house smell nice with candles or baked goods   or playing low key competitive games creating   or being in   an atmosphere that is laid back   harmonious   and pleasant is food for your soul    you innately know what people want you quickly pick up on the non verbalized needs and emotions of other people if you have friends over   you immediately notice if someone seems cold and might need a blanket or someone is looking around and probably wants to know where the bathroom is you also notice when one person seems to like another person or when somebody wants to give criticism but is trying to figure out the most tactful way to give it    it can be difficult for you to take care of yourself because you re so focused on others this is especially true of <type> parents and spouses because <type>s are so in tune with the emotional and physical needs of others they can feel compelled to fix things for everyone else instead of meeting their own needs they often feel guilty for taking time for themselves   especially if they know others are struggling or could use some help eventually   this tends to lead to burnout or co dependency   so it s crucial for <type>s to learn to set healthy boundaries and practice saying no    you are very protective of family you ll go the extra mile to protect your loved ones from harm especially those in your family or inner circle of friends you have a gift for creating stability   security   and dependability for the people you care about it s like you create a force field of protection and gentle care around the people you love    you thrive when you can create something high quality you d rather do something well than do it fast while you are extremely conscious of deadlines   it s more important for you to produce high quality results than to get something done ahead of schedule you get a sense of pleasure from perfecting every detail of a project or task and many people consider you to be meticulous    when you re stressed   you see negative possibilities everywhere during cases of extreme or chronic stress   you get lost in catastrophic thinking you imagine dozens of worst case scenarios and every negative possibility makes you think of another connected tragedy find out ways to manage stress here how each myers briggs personality type reacts to stress   and how to help    you dislike telling people what to do you d rather give people information than be overly directive with them for example   instead of saying   bob   would you set up a hotel reservation for august   th    you might say   bob   do you know a good hotel for our trip on august   th       you also dislike being told what to do while you might seem quiet and agreeable on the outside   inside you re a bit of a rebel you can handle some structure and rules   but you don t like dealing with authoritative   rank pulling individuals you appreciate people who give everyone a chance to have a voice in a decision you believe that the best decision comes from collaboration    you don t ask things of others you wouldn t do yourself you hate intruding on others time and space   so delegating can be hard for you you re unlikely to ask someone to do something you wouldn t do   and many times you try to just do things yourself rather than asking for help    you get quiet when you get upset you are famously patient and understanding   but there are limits when you ve been angered by someone repeatedly   you re likely to get quiet and retreat into mental analysis this is when you delve into your sensing and thinking functions you try to find the rational reasons for your anger and explore whether there are any logical inconsistencies you re not seeing you also try to look at the history of the situation to see if there are any negative patterns that are repeating themselves just be careful if you keep stifling your anger it s likely to come out in a surprisingly explosive way while it may be difficult to verbalize your anger   it s an important part of a healthy relationship    you have a good sense of humor you enjoy lighthearted banter   friendly teasing   and situational humor you also enjoy sharing memes or funny gifs online you tend to find something offbeat and funny in nearly any situation   but you don t always verbalize it you might just get a sparkle in your eye and a half smile on your face as a funny scenario or impression plays in your mind s eye you can even be gifted in turning a conflict situation into something funny and helping people to laugh about it    you crave tangible sensory experiences you enjoy taking your favorite objects in your hands and touching them   noticing every detail on your fingertips you savor the texture of warm   fuzzy socks and cherish the first sip of a hot cup of tea when you feel something   you try to notice every detail about it and experience it in all its intensity    you re wary of intrusive people while you re typically friendly   generous   and easy going   people who seem especially needy or physically overbearing make you put your guard up you like steady   loyal relationships where you have the freedom to disappear for a busy week or two    or month even    and re connect as if no time has ever gone by people who blow up your phone with texts or are always invading your personal space often make you feel uncomfortable and hesitant    you take great joy in simple pleasures you believe that life is made up of thousands of precious moments that other people fail to appreciate in their hurry from the glisten of dewdrops on a blade of grass to the taste of an icy cold popsicle on a hot summer day   you try to savor all the little details and moments that make life worth living    you struggle to see your own potential you tend to struggle when it comes to forecasting your abilities and potential you live from moment to moment and try to enjoy all that life has to offer   but you don t always know how to anticipate what s coming down the road years from now you may have incredible gifts and abilities that could be used in powerful ways   but it often takes a friend to help you realize the potential of your many strengths

infp,i wish women wanted to have casual sex with me according to what i  ve read   women who say they do n t want casual sex will happily forego their morals if the guy is hot enough so i guess i m just not hot enough which breaks my heart i wish women found me hot personally   if i was to go into a relationship   i would be more picky    about looks    more picky about looks    than i would be with respect to casual sex    you  re asking me to devote my whole life to this woman    so of course i want her to be smoking hot but if it  s a nsa situation   then she still has to be hot    i m still picky   i confess      but she does n t have to be a total smoking hot babe it  s not like i m gonna devote my life to her or something it  s just casual   no strings attached but according to what i  ve read   women are apparently the opposite in terms of casual sex   they just want the guy to be hot they do n t care about personality but if she  s looking for a relationship   she might be willing to date an ugly guy   as long as he makes up for it in other traits so   as they say   any guy can get a relationship but casual sex   only the really hot guys can get that i worry if i ever get a girlfriend    probably too late for that too   anyway      then maybe she does n t find me sexually physically attractive maybe she  s only with me for my  sweet and dependable nature  or whatever i do n t get her panties wet   unlike those exciting   sexy bad boys she did casual sex with in her past i merely appeal to her logic i m an apple nobody wants to eat an apple those muscular bad boys were her ice cream ice cream is tempting it makes your mouth watery it tempts your emotions the apple does not there  s nothing tempting about the apple but logically   you know the apple is better for you long term so you force yourself to like it but really   you do n t like it emotionally   it does n t satisfy you it only appeals to your cold logic because the ice cream    the exciting   sexy bad boys    treat you badly in the long term so you force yourself to buy the apple but you really do n t like it you hate it i do n t wanna be apple zoned i wanna be the ice cream to women and studies have shown that women are attracted to muscular men   with respect to short term flings but in terms of long term relationships   they do n t find the muscular men trustworthy so they do n t date them long term i wish women wanted to have casual sex with me any old fat   hairy   muscle less   jaw less guy like me can get a relationship but casual sex   that  s another story i wish women wanted to have casual sex with me that  s the only way i would feel flattered and attractive and sexually desired 
isfj,hello <type>s   in this interview   i talked to claire and lynda about their similarities and differences as <type>s the stereotype of <type>s working in healthcare is definitely valid as both individuals work in that field the big difference however is with lynda being self above tribe being a jumper <type>    si ti    while claire is tribe above self being the standard <type>    si fe    during the interview   claire talked about being uncomfortable being the centre of attention lynda   however   did n t seem to mind either way as long as she gets to do what she wants we also talked about being an ixxj control freak and lynda talked about making a mess with jello with her kids when they were younger to train herself not to freak out hard when it comes to chaos claire talked about perhaps being the bad cop with her kids because of her lead sf blast nagging them however   both claire and lynda are double deciders and they said ultimately   they want their kids to make their own life decision because they are their own person we also talked about fe shaming people and they said they do n t really do it that much because their ti acts as brakes from going overbearing with doing that claire shared how much she dislikes the idea of people thinking you would be a bad parent if your kid is a troublemaker because you  re different individuals we also discussed their exxp swing and lynda said she is doing it more now as an adult going on trips and cruises and just enjoying life claire said she did that more when she was in college and had a partying phase watch this interview here 
infj,those doses and takes altogether come in one to never make one believe he ever approach them by himself that  s what he believed as far his pattern of self love was in the domain of utility to have only its effect on self esteem   he got himself all round up against its gratuity   be it the sole element of himself he confused impersonally with their autonomous presentability for example   in the same vein of separation   one chooses his line of work   well   in which he works   studying it   and the other is simply more of the work than it is akin to study he goes pythagorician with it he studies most firstly by the name and number of all things he wants to consider in his line   same thing   and if he was not to be he concentrates on whatever does not the same as he does he goes way above that problem   and   as he goes down again for good   he reached his method he is apt to discover he never trully wanted both conclusions that  s his future is n t it   aloud as another  s more normalistic piece of work he is now absolutely sure that whatever he wanted as not part of his future was to go against his of doing so in that sense otherwise an unconsumable dose of reality is a take on one  s future it is profoundly unreconciliable one goes through end up exiting with two futures if i come to really fear it for what it is against what it might not be at all   then add one of them for each possibility this does end up into imaginatively unconsequent and unreconciliable but each time separated whole which does n t bend onto the force of any existent future   and in turn onto one deriving from its impossibility to exist   to complement itself an impossible breakthrough coming from an only possible unreconciliability the uselessness of whatever goes against those doses and takes is not even of the pattern of its unpresentability   and so forth contrarily   one  s self hate is not to be reconciliable with any normalities of a piece of work if be it going to the recognizing of this pattern   and so on open wide the gates after having closed them   yes do n t close them off after having opened them out wide 
enfj,hey guys   um   a week or   ago i was just learning about the different types   and i ended up on the celebrity types <type> page   which said that <type> as a type is linked to narcissistic histrionic personality disorders i thought that was kind of weird b c <type>s have such strong fe should n t they be really opposite of those disorders    so   does anyone here have npd hpd       lol what kind of question is that though    or   i do n t know   i m just curious to hear what people think about this and why there would be a link   for the record   i am asking because i grew up with a bpd mother and ended up also suffering from bpd traits    which i am finally getting help for    but   it seems like most commonly bpd people are <type>s <type>s b c of the fi 
infj,it will be a bit long again the default of the professionalized betrayal   from one to one   it was never believed really for what it was   places members of the lost upper middle class into the hands of autonomous physical welfare of what then was never for sure their problem to govern    it just is n t    they confuse hobbying and leveling the high ground   when generally close to exceptional individuals in their symbolic attributes coming from lower middle class environments which grew into a truer period of depopularization of academic benches all came to them as better inquisitive ground for better employment of their life force to be able to learn by living through the societal judgements towards the specifying of love relationships for example   or worklife   ancestral entrepreneurship   group law making   blunt stochastization of income and outcome poverty   to oppose with the greatest care to   well   what could simply be less inclined to make such people in turn what these people learnt from   primarily   by the default itself of its requirement   was themselves first   and the rest followed whatever which is now physicalize in the very practice of their academically learnt decisions   en coulisse arguments   negatiotated pre delegations   professional forcings   amiable compromises and given returns   indeed   was rightfully to never be physical environments are by themselves obligatorily aculturally driven they are there to serve the mental welfare in the cultural sense   outside of reaching systems of what jean jacques rousseau called obligation to oppose to necessity imaginary against felicitative as to what is a society of men coming from the separated conjunction of these two categories they are really what is the closer to culture is deemed to be by the people themselves   that of which the desacralized actual upper middle class opposes its notion of diversity through moving themselves outside of more popular cultural learnings   preaches and functions through boredom in the sole hope of regaining the upper hand over whatever permitted the arising of these good misses and gentlemen   come to invest more and more the trust towards acultural methods of popular   strictly mental i dare say   more worldly   felicitative mode of being under that notion they in all   refuse obligation   that on which they cut short by specializing themselves in newly sought positions of leadership for roles which do n t need them   they preach more and more the trend of usable insanity to react to any pushes for unstable   so called deviant mentality in fact more really a search for cultural abundance   that which almost never answers so well for whomever in turn would respond better in the here to of precedent work she misses one category then lands there   which in his own right   is wholefully physical   trully    revocably    organized culturally   and an other is sadly more atuned to work at their expense at an acultural rythm as an organism of results of which   well   the first would in turn answer much more well and freely so from an unrevendicated pro social autist    little clarifying note of the aspect these organisms would be the same or they would be not    
enfp,think about what he  s done he was good at organizing he was a charmeur   in fact he was a womanizer    now   i was not expecting this    he was not good in math   in fact he sucked at math   but he was good at poetry or literature he was almost more a politican than a phisicyst he made something believable what everyone thought was not possible now what is ne if not that    overall i think oppenheimer was an <type> his enthusiasm won him over when he realized he could create something what others could n t   but ultimately he realized what he  s done and he called for supervision i think it fits the <type> profile more than anything btw i think teller was <type>
