estj,"hey !every time i have done the mbti tests i have been labeled an type . now , i do identify with many of their characteristics and i thought i was an type for a long time . however , recently , i have started to doubt that i am an introvert . when i was younger , i was a bit overweight and i got bullied by people i regarded as popular and important at schools and in sports teams etc . it made me extremely self conscious and i feared everythingfrom voicing my opinion to taking my shirt of at a public pool( last time i did that was maybeyears ago ). even though i lost the excess weight a long time ago and i now work outtimes a week , i think i still have the same mindset . i study at a prominent university and i always feel like everyone else is better than me and dislike me . unfortunately , i think i always value people in terms of popularity etc . and if i think that they are of high value and able to hurt me and influence others to dislike me , i feel threatened and distance myself from them in order to avoid getting picked on again . i also over analyze absolutely everything after having a social encounter with these people and it is driving me nuts . this has led to me being very socially inactive at uni , which is pretty much the only time i socialize . i have like one or two close friends and i have a very hard time taking commando socially since i presume that everyone dislikes me and wants to hurtshame me . i often dream about living on a deserted island somewhere far away where i do not have to think about other peopleit is so energy draining to constantly overthink everything i do . however , i recently attended a social event with video gamers , people i consider less judgmental and more accepting , and i found myself immediately taking charge socially even though everyone were complete strangers etc . i felt like i finally got the opportunity to use my natural leading and organizing instincts . i had a blast and when i got home i was so incredibly happy and filled with energy , which made me think i was actually an extrovert . even though i have things in common with type' s , i prefer working alone etc . , i really think that i need more social interactions to be happy and energized . i want more friends and people to talk to . but since i fear everything , i force myself to withdraw and suffer the painful feeling of regret . could it be that i am actually and extrovert and that my poor self esteem and my social anxiety qualify me as an introvert on the tests ? do any of you type' s struggle with poor selfimage and social anxiety ? how do you fight it ? how do you stop caring about what other people think of you ? i hate being this selfcentered and judgmental . also , sorry for the long blog post , i did not intend to write this much at first."

infj,"this really eats at me sometimes . i love people , yet i feel so disconnected from them . it' s like everyone' s style of communication is a different language that i just ca n ' t speak or understand . sometimes i try to listen to the conversations of other people , and it' s like they are speaking a different language . i think a big reason why we feel like outsiders is that we crave only deep connections and deep conversations . most people on earth have numerous shallow connections and a few deep connections with others , and carry many shallow and few deep conversations with others . we simply cannot do surface level , which is the bread and butter of most communication in this world . if you look at the three most common types , type , type , and type , they are either si dom or aux . majority rules . so most casual conversations typically revolve around discussing si . where is si in an type function stack ? yeah ,. dead last . we want to talk about things our ni discovered or how people are doing with fe . that' s usually way too deep for casual conversations . we have no interest in discussing si , but it' s what the most common types talk about . there' s nothing we types can do about this . it' s not something certain types did wrong , or something we did wrong . it' s simply the result of being in the minority , and how we are built . i hate feeling so disconnected . i hate being in a room of dozens of people only to feel so disconnected like i ' m completely alone that i might as well be in another dimension . we will always feel like this . my advice ? try your best to accept that you are different . understand there is nothing wrong with you . even then it' s difficult , because your probably like me , and you wish you could fit in and connect with others better . even then , it' s still going to hurt feeling so different . it' s even worse because of how perceptive we are , so we truly gasp how different we are compared to others much more then most people . maybe if we work hard to find that one person we can have a strong close connection with , we would n ' t feel so sad."

infp,"hello , i am an type woman . i met an type a few weeks ago and it' s been the most surreal encounter i' ve ever had . so many things needed to be aligned for us to meet and i just felt this huge attraction for him . i like to compare it to the before sunrise movie( and knowing they are both our mbtis , it makes even more sense ). i was traveling to another country , i was supposed to meet with friends for dinner . this type is also from abroad and he was meeting a friend of a friend that i was supposed to have dinner with . so we ended up having all dinner and drinks together . he did n ' t specifically look at me or interact with me even though he seemed to interact with everyone else . we are both taken so i did n ' t think much more than that .( now looking back and reading about types it makes total sense because he did tell me after , that he thought i was cute when he first saw me so i guess he acted this way on purpose ). the night passes by and we end up in the kitchen talking . i start to feel a vibe but i just think he is a bit tipsy . he started to share with me his deepest thoughts even though we just met . at this point , i ' m thinking he is cute and had the sweetest worries , i could tell he cared a lot about his family and people around him and i liked that a lot about him . the conversation went on . i just really liked what we were talking about from religion to my relationship issues with my bf , i felt such a strong connection and i liked that he was so emotionally developed and empathetic , i' ve never met a guy like this . i could sense he was attracted to me because he became touchy and i just felt so attracted to him too . i never felt so emotionally connected with someone i just met . by the end , we were just the last ones left , everyone left or went to sleep . the tension was real . he started softly by telling me that he was happy we met and how close he felt to me even though we just met but he ended up telling me how attracted he was to me . and after that , it' s just like he had no filter , and he would just go on about his feelings towards me . i was so taken aback at how transparent he was about how he felt and i felt the same about him . even though i think we both really wanted to act on it , we decided to leave it like this and not do anything because we were both taken . during this whole time , he was just very respectful . we slept one hour , had coffee together at a coffee shop in the morning while waiting for the others to wake up . i was wondering if i would still feel as attracted to him but i did , i think he did too because he seemed so nervous during the coffee and he would continue asking me tons of deep questions about life . i knew i was leaving the country soon so that was going to be the only time we would see each other . when i left , he felt distant and i guessed it was because his friend was there . and that was the one and only time i saw him . later on , i initiated a conversation with him on instagram but after a few days , he told me in the nicest way possible that out of respect he will stop talking to me , that he needs to go back , settle and think about it . he said he' s good in his relationship but maybe sometimes connection happens and we ca n ' t help it . i really understand how hard our situation is and i also need to process it on my side and decide what i want to do with my relationship . a few days later , he unfollowed me . i saw him look at my stories once after that but not since . i later tried to guess his mbti from the conversation we had and i think he' s an type . it makes even more sense knowing that it' s supposed to be one of the best mbti matches for an type . so my question is what goes into the mind of an type in this kind of situation where you are taken but attracted to someone else ? thanks a lot for making it to the end of my story !

enfj,so i' ve been snooping around many forums and there tends to be stereotypes for many of the personality types.do we have stereotypes besides awesomeness ? laughing
infj,"the idea for this was brought up a few days ago . the notion was received well , so i figured i' d get us started . here is a thread for general relationship questions for types !all types may post here . hopefully , this thread will soon be a repository of knowledge and opinion , for all who stumble across it to examine and learn from . examples what proscons might there be in a xxxxtype relationship ? which aspects of a xxxx might an type appreciate the most ? here is my personal situation with an type relationship. . any tips on how to handle it ? please help me understand. . why are you guys so awesomefrustratingnutsetc . in relationships ? .and so forth !types , feel free to respond andor post your own advice and personal experience on how to approach andor care for our evercomplex type . after all , we tend to be quite the romantics. . thanks , everyone !

isfp,"first of all , i ' m an type female . i have never had a relationship with an type and to my awareness do n ' t have any friends who are type . however , i ' m in the beginning stages of getting to know a guy who is type . we have been talking forweeks so it is super new . we hung out alone for the st time the other night and i know he' s interested in me . i have n ' t heard from him since but he hearted a response i put on his wall the next day . my sense is that he is a bit scared but is interested and that in time he' ll emerge from the cave that he went back into . anyways , i' d appreciate any thoughts to help me understand type' s in relationships . thank you"
esfj,"something i do n ' t quite understand about types is that they derive their happiness from the approval of others . for example , i know an type who religiously tracks the number of likes they get on facebook and instagram . it seems that types are very kind and generous to others , but that stems from a desire to be wellliked , not necessarily from philosophically valuing kindness and generosity . to me( an inxj ), this sounds like a very insecure approach to life . how do more mature types work around this ? is there a better word than insecurity to describe this ? can somebody clarify this for me or elaborate on this ? thank you !

enfj,"have you experienced this? how did you handle this? how long did it take for your to come back on the dating scene( and get really involved in a relationship )? what helped you? if you are a female , you can answer as well! "
infj,"i feel like my case is clear . to be an type seems like to be the ultimate way to be downtoearth and not dwell on senseless shores as my intuition suggests . i admire types to the core . sweethearted , a helpinghand by nurture is in their nature . i as an type do not seems as humble as them . i have strong opinions that lead to nowhere . i am daydreaming all day long . stuffed with irrational fears and nowhere to go in my heart . i am asking question , knowing they are pointless . types do not feel so lonely , because they are satisfied with little from the start . our ni function is our very own doom . it is an consciousness that is always aware . it has become more aware of the awareness itself . types are more part of the world , in the world . they experience the human experience in simplest of terms . they take action in purer forms , while my actions are layered in semantics , in intentions , in meaning . i do n ' t know how to explain . but xsfjs are blessed . they do not look behind every curtain , every leave . i look at their faces and a sadness of a life i want to live overcomes me . types just know too much . i am an alien , but they are human . i just want to be normal . i want to forget everything."

istj,"i' ve read thru many of your threads , including the stickies , and have learned a lot . but one thing i ca n ' t understand is , if an type man is clearly into you , why is he so passive as far as pursuit goes ? my type lives. hours away and owns a few successful businesses , therefore , he is very busy . however , when i ask to see him , he will drive out to my place or vice versa , no problem . he consistently initiates texts with me on a daily basis , has told me he sees a future with me , i check all his boxes , and he wants to build a homefamily with mebut he never asks to see me or plans a date . it' s like.there' s no urgency on his part . it drives me crazy and absolutely baffles me . as an type , i usually end up with aggressive and passionate men who go fromright away and pursue me with gusto . so.this whole slower than a snail with a broken leg thing is really hard for me to understand . conversation with him is easy , but i am leery as to how to approach this with him . i know i need to be direct , but i also have read that patience is the key . so.my question isdo type men prefer to be pursued by the women they' re interested in ? and if so , what' s the best way to do this without overwhelming or pressuring him ? if he' s not actively asking me out , should i assume he' s not interested ? very confusing . if you could shed some light.i would greatly appreciated . fwiw , we' re in our s and have been datingmonths with a break in between due to communication issues , which we are resolving very well now . we are exclusive but not committed .( he says relationships take time to developcommitment is a huge step. ) "
enfj,"without getting into too many details , i had an type female ex who i actually met while she was in another relationship a few years ago . this is a shitty thing to admit , but we had a short emotional affair but i recall her inviting things to get physical on one occasion while her partner was away . i awkwardly avoided it . she ended things i think when things started to get too intimate .( not proud of this )fast forward a year and a half later , her partner who she was with( after she sort of branched to after her previous marriage ofyears )and whom she proposed to( he said yes )left her months later . she said both were narcissists . soon after their breakup , i randomly contacted her out of the blue and she told me they had broken up . we connected for a few months before we ended up in a long distance relationship . she ended itmonths later after significantly pulling away and i proceeded to chase after her right out of my life . then contacted me anothermonths later because she missed me . i proceeded to pursue her again, and we ended up the same place with her progressively shutting me down , bailing on plans if i didnt act perfectly . i have bipolar disorder and it got triggered by the stress from my fears of abandonment . i said some really awful things to her and was sending her pages and pages of texts . i feel like she hasnt really taken much accountability . she is civil with me now . but told me that once its done with her its done . and ive heard many types say that . i am asking for help with this does that always mean they are done ? if not , what would need to happen to repair things ? could her offer of staying friends grow into more once i regain her trust ? or am i better off going no contact ? i do really value her , but our relationship is nothing like it used to be . she says too much has happened . thank you !type learning how to be healthier"

istp,"hello , i recently joined the site and have been really impressed with the level of insight shared on this forum . i was hoping someone could help me with a type i just met . my employer recently hired a new college graduate(years old )to fill a vacancy and subsequently my boss asked me to train . i am ayear old male type and after getting to know him over the past month of training i am confident he is a type . we share similar hobbies and interests and just two days ago he invited me along to one of his hiking expiditions . i was really on the fence about how well he liked me as he is hard to read . since the invite , he and i both have begun to share a lot more detail about our daily livessomething he for any other person gives a typical type generic answer if asked . what brings me here looking for an answer revolves around how this particular type stares at me . for the past week , as i pass by him , i catch him out of the corner of my eye staring at me . only me . he does not do this towards others and has little interest in how others in the room are behaving . yet , it is like he watches my every move with his head tilted just enough to see me so he could turn quickly if needed . he is a bit immature still and thinks he is being slick when he does this . when i naturally turn in his direction , he quickly adjusts his head like he had no idea i was there . and his facial expression is really weird when he does this with his mouth slightly open . interestingly as of late , he has started to not pull away and we lock eyes face to face . admittedly , i too stare at times at people i am trying to size up . however , how this type stares is unlike anything i have ever encountered as my feeling trait tells me his overall body language does not correlate like he is trying to read me . then today , i again noticed through a reflection on a piece of glass he was staring at me . a few moments later he mumbled and asked me over to his work station for some help . we work in a lab and he needed to transfer some acid . he asked if i would do it . mind you , he has far more academic experience at this than i do . the task at hand did not at all need two people but i happily obliged . in fact , he had done a similiar task earlier today without me . while i was in the pouring process , he then proceeded to place his hand on the glass container to pour the solution with me . i do n ' t like to be touchy at all with someone unless i know them and this really made me uncomfortable as it just simply caught me off guard . if this had been any other coworker i would not even thought twice about it . i felt like he artificially created the task just to get near me . i have read about how a type can gaze but i was hoping someone could shed some light on why an type stares secretly when they are not upset . i hate to talk myself up but i am usually good at reading body language but he leaves me so perplexed as to his motives . am i overthinking this and was he just trying to study me ? was this a poor social attempt using his physical instinct to create a situation to try to bond ? or perhaps he has a sexual attraction towards me ? if so , i read my type personality is not one they typically like . i am curious to understand why an type would secretly stare."
istp,"this article comes from personality hunt . the unhealthy type( understanding the type dark side )innovation , independence , and decisiveness . these are appropriate words to describe an type . what about an unhealthy type ? can they be described in the same manner ? if youve been thinking about this , i have good news . this article will discuss it in closer detail . who is the unhealthy type ? an unhealthy type is an type who displays traits that are wide of their true character . sometimes , these traits might be an extreme version of their usual traits or a new one altogether . there are many reasons why an type can become unhealthy . some of them include failed expectations and loss of their job or partner . when an type becomes unhealthy , people around will notice . if youre an type , the best way to avoid slipping into that situation is to know the signs of an unhealthy type . its also important to know that experiencing one of these signs does not necessarily signal unhealthiness . signs of an unhealthy type. extremely arrogant types are smart but not arrogant . because they are introverts , they usually are more reserved and fun . unhealthy types are different . arrogant oozes through them . now , everyone can be arrogant . however , they take it too far . for example , unhealthy types might believe they are always right and look down on others . these are all done openly and might make them unlikeable . these are not normal traits of an type .. unproductive unhealthy types are complacent and lazy . their extroverted sensing function combines with their perceiving function to create this problem . thus , unhealthy types are serial procrastinators . in the long term , this might make them miss lifechanging opportunities .. withdraws completely types are introverts . so , its normal if they are a bit withdrawn . unhealthy types will take this to an extreme . they might isolate themselves from society and their friends . some might become paranoid , thinking everyone is out to get them . their withdrawals can quickly deteriorate into other issues like depression .. much more aggressive unhealthy types are more aggressive . while physicality is a big way they show their aggressiveness , verbal cues , and body gestures are also high on that list . unhealthy types might also have a temper . backed by their se function , they might enjoy violence and fighting . because they are thinkers , becoming ruthless is a real possibility .. looks a lot like an underdeveloped type unhealthy types are a lot like underdeveloped type . one way is their view of rules and norms . unhealthy types find ways to bend even the most sensible rules . they become obsessed with independence and feel these norms are out to control them . they might also dress really poorly and care less about their appearance .. extremely impulsive perceivers generally struggle more with being impulsive . unhealthy types are the worst hit . they are more reckless and might make decisions on a whim . this can lead to serious problems with their finances and career .. serious communication issues unhealthy types will struggle with communication for several reasons . first , they become less sensitive to peoples concerns and needs . this also includes what they say . thus , unhealthy types will listen less when people talk . they also have other traits , such as paranoia and anger . these two traits make communication intimidating or frustrating . how to get out of the type dark side do you believe you are an unhealthy type ? here are some ways to avoid or get out of the type dark side .. learn more about yourself thats why youre here . learning more about yourself helps you in many ways . first , it opens the door to selfimprovement . it also helps you to identify triggers and work on them . the mbti and enneagram are great places to start . if you dont know your type yet , you should research the various mbti and enneagram types . there are a lot of articles on types right here on this website . thats a good place to start .. selfcare its always a good idea to practice selfcare . as stated earlier , unhealthiness usually develops when theres stress or pressure . giving yourself time to recuperate is essential . types practice selfcare by doing the things they love . so , take out time to do these things . heres an article that discusses selfcare for all mbti types .. develop your extroverted feeling function many things might change for an unhealthy type if their fe was a bit more developed . theyll care more about others and the harmony of their family or group . developing your fe is a good way to reduce your level of unhealthiness . however , it takes time and conscious effort to pull it off .. see a therapist if everything fails , seeing a therapist might be your best bet . they are trained to help you deal with these sorts of problems . while this is true , ensure youre comfortable with it before diving in . there are now options for online therapies . so , you can explore that option if it appeals to you . commonly asked questions about the unhealthy type what is a healthy type personality ? a healthy type personality displays the normal traits of an type . this does not mean that a healthy type must be a stereotypical type . however , the absence of extreme traits is a good sign of healthiness . what do types struggle with ? types might find it harder to look at the bigger picture . this can lead to struggles in business projects . they might lack the patience to follow through when theres little progress."

entj,"hi , need advice from fellow type based on an situation that is crippling my confidence . there is this project , in which i have submitted certain proposal to achieve the objectives of the brief . however , everyone who saw the brief say that i am wrong . even when i do provide my extensive rationale , they did not agree to it . often when i provide explanation , people do understand and is convince , yet this time its the opposite . i have also listened to others opinion with a open mind , yet their reason seems to not be able to convince me as well . i truly want to agree with what the majority is telling me , yet i could n ' t because i am not convinced by their rationale , and i am not the type to just accept the norm or incorrect rationale and i rather do what is correct and precise . also , i am not saying it out of ego , as i am truly willing to be convince and change my mind if other' s rationale is correct . so i am kind of stuck in the middle , in which i am not convinced , and others are not convinced by me . thus , i am now questioning my own sanity , judgement , rationale , and even my own learning and observation if they are true or not , that what i belief might be irrational , personal and subjective , because like i said , usually people are convince by my rationale , yet it seems that i am the only one convinced by my rationale and everyone disagree with me , even after i provide my extensive explanation . i am just afraid that i am dealing with a blind spot that i could not see . i have also self reflect and question my rationale , but it still seems that what i propose still holds true , which makes me doubt my own rationale even more , yet i could not just accept others opinion because they are false. .( i am judging this situation without my ego making the calls )what advice would you give in this situation , and what would fellow type does in a situation when they truly believe they are rationally correct without ego even after hearing the opinion of others ? thank you in advance !

intp,"in another topic , i was trying to think of something that could describe ti written and viewed by an type in order to clearly separate ti from the usual tine mental masturbation . from my point of view , ti is too often associated with type , and it often leads to a huge misconception about ti . the best example of type philosopher i had in mind was miyamoto musashi( japanese master swordsman , painter , and author. )example of ti life rules( written by type )theprecepts of dokkodo the way of walking aloneby miyamoto musashi. accept everything just the way it is .. do not seek pleasure for its own sake .. do not , under any circumstances , depend on a partial feeling .. think lightly of yourself and deeply of the world .. be detached from desire your whole life long .. do not regret what you have done .. never be jealous .. never let yourself be saddened by a separation .. resentment and complaint are appropriate neither for oneself or others .. do not let yourself be guided by the feeling of lust or love .. in all things have no preferences .. be indifferent to where you live .. do not pursue the taste of good food .. do not hold on to possessions you no longer need .. do not act following customary beliefs .. do not collect weapons or practice with weapons beyond what is useful .. do not fear death .. do not seek to possess either goods or fiefs for your old age .. respect buddha and the gods without counting on their help .. you may abandon your own body but you must preserve your honour .. never stray from the way . the guy spent his life aimlessly traveling and recklessly killing people( caricature )he wrote it one week before dying(years old )and it more or less resume his lifestyleinternal rules . even as an type( who prefers to brawl with abstact thoughtsconcepts , and wo n ' t spend her life going into physical brawls ). i think his dokkodo the way of walking alone represents ti perfectly . even the title is perfect . of course , it does n ' t mean that every ti strong users has the same principles , but there are a lot of common points . the rules are very short but they actually took a lifetimelife research to reach them . there' s also the attachment to reach internal peace without being dependent of the external world , and without being strayed by feelingsdesirespartialitycustomary beliefs( take neutral inputs ). the need of independence is very strong . i find this example very relevant . this clearly reeks of tiness neutralityimpartiality with very very low chance to mistake it for fi even though we' re talking of life precepts and honor . this also shows why ti is often associated withrebellion( do not act following customary beliefsnever stray from the way . implied , just fuck off people trying to take control of you , and just do what' s relevant. )with being unemotional even though we do have feelings( do not , under any circumstances , depend on a partial feeling. )being , very , very laidbackwith low will to control the outer world( accept everything just the way it is. )i personally find this text very inspiring . fellow types , what do you think about that? do you recognize your ti in this? or is it just me? thank you in advance for your inputs . editi ' m not asking for a ti definition discussiondebate . there are plenty of these on perc . i ' m asking you( tidomaux )if you recognize you in this , and if these principles speak to you specifically . so , no abstractconceptual discussion and debates please , but more personal experiences and lifestyles sharing discussions . thank you in advance for sticking on the thread' s subject . editif you have inspiring texts on the same subject you want to share , i would be more than happy to read them!

entp,"i mean , really , what did you expect ? happy i' ve noticed that there are a lot of ask aa question threads in the other forums , but nobody seems to want to ask an type a question . that' s probably because you know you' re unlikely to get a serious or useful answer . so now you can ask an type a question , with the full understanding that whatever you get as a response will be witty , sarcastic and less than totally accurate . and , you know , somebody might actually give you a valid answer . if they feel like it."

isfp,"sometimes i learn something about the world , some new connection . it links up in a way that makes it feel i' ve leveled up . it usually happens when i explore some new system of knowledge and i realize how it connects to something i already understand . it is like the floodgates are opened and i feel like a god or something . i know this is a perfect example of jungian inflation where my weak ni gets overconfident and think i ' m smarter than anyone else . still i ' m actually smarter as a byproduct of the realization , it really did level me up , but i overestimate how much smarter i got . i' ve found that a good way to get my feet on the ground is trying to write the knowledge down in some document . forcing myself to try to te out the insight really shows me how weak a grip i have on it . it also makes me better at the thing i leveled up in , so it is all good , even if my ego feels fully deflated . anyone else can relate to some of this?"

isfj,"hey there , i would like to know your types take on this . you may judge me for the infidelity part . . i do n ' t get this type( m ). he' s been with his first girlfriend( longdistance )for overyears . we started having casual sex aboutmonthes ago . he made the first step . we started texting a lot , were seeing each other once or twice a week . cuddling and talking afterwards . we starting meeting for a walk or lunch just as often . well . i fell in love . and to me it feels like he is , too . he is very private about his relationship . and reluctant to talk about it . no matter to whom . only when i repeatedly asked weither he was happy with his girlfriend he said yes . another time when i tried to talk openly he told me straight away i do n ' t want to start a relationship with you . i am already in a relationship . as far as i know he has been cheating on his girlfriend quiet a few times . it started when he fell in love with another girl who was making an effort to seduce him a couple of years ago . that girl told me he wanted to leave his girlfriend . but when she came round , he had fallen out of love . he confessed that he did not have sex with his girlfriend since we started having sex . it seems that she is never been much interested in sex. . which is a pitty , because he is a very gifted lover who enjoys sex and intimacy beyond measure . he is just as unwilling to talk about how we feel for each other . he shows me in many ways that he cares . he avoided phrasing it as beeing in love with me but , actually , that is what i ' m guessing .( or hoping ? )he did mention casualy , however , how he told a friend he was besotted with me . he is very appreciative and caring . he said he enjoys working with me . he compliments me a lot . on my body just as much as my personality .( he says stuff like how can one person be this wonderfull ? )when we ca n ' t see each other , he texts me that he misses me . before we meet( even for work )he will text that he is locking forward to it . we are secretly holding hands under the table( e.g . in a bar with freinds ). well , and we just ca n ' t take our hand of each other . when i told him i would like to see him more often , he said i was pushing an open door . but when i said i wanted more , he backed off . he tries to make it sound like we have a great friendship . every time i told him that i do n ' t want to be just friends he told me with tears in his eyes that he did n ' t want me to leave . the grown up in me knows that this guy is not willing to leave his girlfriend , that i should not try to interfere any moreand that this is a stupid place to start a realitionship anyway . but being realistic is not my strength . and the dreamy romantic part of me just wants to be with him . because this feels amazing . because i know how relunctant he is about big changes . i feel stupid and naive . but then again . i felt like that every single time i fell in love . i appreaciate any reply . thank you so much for your time !( i feel better just be writing this down. ) "

entj,"it' s a gander because i do n ' t know much about ms . porter , but i would type her fieldmarshalmobilizer type based exclusively on her questioning during congressional hearings . mobilizing task forces within government. . mobilizing leadership hierarchies within government , leader of leaders. . many of the leaders that she' s leading at the congressional hearings appear to be our friends , the adjudicating guardians( sj ). they seem to respect her , which is to be expected for a leader of leaders . the problem with fieldmarshalsmobilizers( the smart ones , anyway )is that they are rare because leaders need leaders too and fieldmarshals prefer that role more than other types . apparently she' s running for california senate inand i imagine she ought to have success in that pursuit , but politics can be greasy."

intp,"i had n ' t found any threads on this specific issue and personality clashing , but i thought it important to discuss in case any other type' s had similar experiences in regards to an emotionally exploitative type motherfather ? my mother is an type , and i really do love her . she' s funny , thoughtful , always tells me she loves me and hugs me a lot . i have some really fantastic memories with my mum , sometimes we might go through periods where we genuinely delight in each others company , but in saying that , there' s a lot behind the scenes crap that she dismisses even happened . it' s the personal unnecessary attacks , constant guilt tripspassive aggression , always calling me a disappointing shit and a hassle , basically a human hovercraft always wanting to know what i ' m up to because quietsuspicious , never interested in my opinionsinterests , made fun of my weight in high school and put me on diets , compares me to other girls , slamming doors in my face , leaving me locked outside when i arrived homeminutes past curfew , never let me go to sleepovers or have birthday parties , etc etc . i really was just this slightly overweight , nerd who did n ' t want any trouble . another thing that amazes me is that both of my siblings are both feelers , and are n ' t nearly as distressed by her ? if i ' m ever a dick to someone , i usually do n ' t even realize i ' m being a dick . i ' m probably just being honest haha . but a feeler will be a fucking dick shit to people just because they can and they know better . inbetween kicking a few cats . generally i ' m not so sensitive , as usually peoples comments are just water off a ducks back for me . but this is just on a whole different plane . i literally cringe every time i do the absolute slightest thing wrong because i know there' s this impending dark cloud waiting to emotionally take a dump on me . she screams anytime i even eat something that i did n ' t know was hers . haha can you tell i ' m not bitter ? ah well . if any other type' s relate or if any other types can offer any additional insights , that' d be cool too . free therapy , god bless the internet."
