entj,"hi , need advice from fellow type based on an situation that is crippling my confidence . there is this project , in which i have submitted certain proposal to achieve the objectives of the brief . however , everyone who saw the brief say that i am wrong . even when i do provide my extensive rationale , they did not agree to it . often when i provide explanation , people do understand and is convince , yet this time its the opposite . i have also listened to others opinion with a open mind , yet their reason seems to not be able to convince me as well . i truly want to agree with what the majority is telling me , yet i could n ' t because i am not convinced by their rationale , and i am not the type to just accept the norm or incorrect rationale and i rather do what is correct and precise . also , i am not saying it out of ego , as i am truly willing to be convince and change my mind if other  ' s rationale is correct . so i am kind of stuck in the middle , in which i am not convinced , and others are not convinced by me . thus , i am now questioning my own sanity , judgement , rationale , and even my own learning and observation if they are true or not , that what i belief might be irrational , personal and subjective , because like i said , usually people are convince by my rationale , yet it seems that i am the only one convinced by my rationale and everyone disagree with me , even after i provide my extensive explanation . i am just afraid that i am dealing with a blind spot that i could not see . i have also self reflect and question my rationale , but it still seems that what i propose still holds true , which makes me doubt my own rationale even more , yet i could not just accept others opinion because they are false... .  ( i am judging this situation without my ego making the calls )  what advice would you give in this situation , and what would fellow type does in a situation when they truly believe they are rationally correct without ego even after hearing the opinion of others ? thank you in advance !

estj,"hello types !  in this interview , i got a chance to talk to tamara about what it  ' s like to be an type tesi bpc ( s )  ff . tamara talked about having double feminine st blast and how it comes across as fe at first , especially when she joins a new group , but people soon realize that she  ' s trying to te fix problems for them . she also talked about how she loves the nt play and how she does it all day and problem solving with other people is something she enjoys . tamara thought she was saviour consume but turns out it  ' s because her nf is double masculine and she can really see it as well as the fact that she is infodominant and having the most accurate information is important to her . we then talked about sf blast and how tamara has trouble sleeping , and neglects processing her emotions . tamara also talked about having trouble having a consistent health routine for herself . we then talked about her fi love and hate and tamara was apprehensive to share them since her fi is at the bottom . however , once she got started , it was easy for her to talk about her likes and dislikes . this was especially true when we talked about her sexual modalities and being a tester . she loves smelling different perfumes and trying different foods . watch this interview here"
enfj,"without getting into too many details , i had an type female ex who i actually met while she was in another relationship a few years ago . this is a shitty thing to admit , but we had a short emotional affair but i recall her inviting things to get physical on one occasion while her partner was away . i awkwardly avoided it . she ended things i think when things started to get too intimate .  ( not proud of this )  fast forward a year and a half later , her partner who she was with  ( after she sort of branched to after her previous marriage of  years )  and whom she proposed to  ( he said yes )  left her months later . she said both were narcissists . soon after their breakup , i randomly contacted her out of the blue and she told me they had broken up . we connected for a few months before we ended up in a long distance relationship . she ended it  months later after significantly pulling away and i proceeded to chase after her right out of my life . then contacted me another  months later because she missed me . i proceeded to pursue her again  , and we ended up the same place with her progressively shutting me down , bailing on plans if i didnt act perfectly . i have bipolar disorder and it got triggered by the stress from my fears of abandonment . i said some really awful things to her and was sending her pages and pages of texts . i feel like she hasnt really taken much accountability . she is civil with me now . but told me that once its done with her its done . and ive heard many types say that . i am asking for help with this does that always mean they are done ? if not , what would need to happen to repair things ? could her offer of staying friends grow into more once i regain her trust ? or am i better off going no contact ? i do really value her , but our relationship is nothing like it used to be . she says too much has happened . thank you !  type learning how to be healthier"
isfp,"as already pointed out in another forum , these should not be viewed to determine one  ' s type , but for information purposes only . whether you agree with susan storm  ' s assessments or not , should not influence any from determining their best fit type as being type .   youre extremely down to earth you take life as it comes and , according to typologists paul d . tieger and barbara barrontieger , are the most unassuming and downtoearth of all types .  ( p .  , the art of speedreading people )  . you are very aware of the facts of life , and the reality of what is happening around you . not much can rattle you because you tend to have a very grounded outlook .   you show your affection through actions more than words youre typically not someone to verbalize a bunch of effusive praises to the people you love . rather than whispering sweet nothings , youre more likely to shovel someones snow or make them a mixtape . your feelings , although deep , are very private and internally felt . you tend to show your affection and love through acts of service and helpful gestures more than words of admiration .   you are deeply affected by the pain or misfortune of others although you may seem mysterious and even stoic on the outside , you are deeply feeling on the inside . you are tremendously affected by the pain , unhappiness , or trauma of others . you instantly imagine how it must feel to be in their shoes . this empathy tends to grow as you age and mature . you might find yourself feeling intensely troubled , sensing a deep pain in your heart and a lump in your throat as you hear about the afflictions that others have experienced .   you take a while to get to know youre not someone who immediately wears your heart on your sleeve . you need to know that you can trust someone before you share your true feelings , your pain , or your tough experiences in life . highly effusive , expressive people can be overwhelming to you and if they ask for a lot of details about your life it can make you feel anxious or even suspicious .   you quickly notice what other people need because you are so observant and attentive to details , you are quick to notice when the people around you seem worried , stressed , cold , or uncomfortable in any way . youre probably one of the first to offer a warm blanket to someone who is cold , or the first to go snuggle a pet that seems lonely or anxious for friendship .   you try to hold space for peoples unique differences its crucial to you to be openminded to the experiences and worldviews of others . while you hold strictly to your own beliefs , you also realize that everyone else is shaped by their unique life experiences . you tend to be quietly accepting of others unless they are sharing beliefs that are condescending or harsh to your personal values .   managing longrange projects leaves you overwhelmed because youre more focused on the present than the future , it can be challenging for you to imagine how things are likely to play out . projects that take a lot of focused , methodical attention and have a distant payout tend to be frustrating to you . you like to get quick results and see an immediate result from what you are putting your energy into now .   you are suspicious of sugarcoating and overlyeffusive behavior some people believe that feeling types want all their words wrapped up in words of praise , affirmation , or compliments . for types , this can actually be offputting . these types like people who are straightforward and real with them . authenticity and direct honesty are more important to them than cloying , sentimental words .   you have a lot of aesthetic sense you notice the world around you in highdefinition detail . details stand out . blue isnt just blue , its sapphire or egyptian blue or azure . you notice what colors complement each other and enjoy perusing art museums or looking at different fashions to see which style best resembles you as an individual . to you , colors , designs , clothing  all of it can exemplify a part of your unique personality in a way that words just cant define .   you crave creative freedom you enjoy toying with creative supplies and materials to come up with something completely unique . you enjoy careers that allow you to be creative , whether thats through photography , marketing , cooking , hairstyling , performing , or many other avenues .   you hate being rushed you weigh decisions for longer than most people , trying to understand the significance or value of each option indepth . when people pressure you to make up your mind quickly , you feel irritable and resentful .   you empathize with the underdog you are particularly drawn to oddballs , misfits , and misunderstood or marginalized people . because of your individualistic nature , you appreciate people who march to the beat of their own drum .   youre a closeted adrenaline junkie sure , you enjoy bingewatching netflix and laboring over a creative project . but theres also a side of you that is hungry for physical intensity and thrilling action . whether youre rock climbing , dancing , or speeding past a slow driver  you enjoy pushing yourself physically and getting a rush of independence and freedom as a result .   you help people see options you have an eye for opportunities in the present moment , and you help people find resources and alternatives they may not have considered previously . you tend to stay calm in a crisis and help people find creative ways out of difficult situations .   youre drawn to the mysterious you enjoy spending time alone and imagining how the future could unfold . conceptualizing new ways of seeing things can be very stimulating and energizing for you . at the same time , you tend to distrust yourself when it comes to guessing how something will happen in the distant future . when youre being creative your intuition really does shine !  you enjoy doing creative projects where you can draw attention to mysterious or symbolic meanings .   you hate rigid rules and structures you like being flexible and adapting to the needs of the moment rather than being stuck with guidelines that tie you down . you feel like life is unpredictable , and as a result , its better to be able to go with the flow rather than checkin with your schedule to make sure everything is running according to a strict plan .   you dislike giving negative feedback critiquing people is something that tends to send shivers up your spine . you like to create an atmosphere of openness and quiet warmth , not an atmosphere of defensiveness and shame . because of this , you tend to put off giving criticism or give it as gently as humanly possible .   you think better when youre surrounded by beauty sitting in a stale cubicle is probably one of the worst ways for you to hand in your best work . your creativity and focus blossom when you are surrounded by lush colors or ethereal landscapes . you often work well outdoors , in the wilderness , or in an area that youve made your own with beautiful details that inspire you .   you crave independence nothing fills you with more joy than venturing out on your own to do something meaningful . stepping onto an airplane , roaming around in your car , or taking a risk on a career that aligns with your values  ( even if it dismays your more traditional parents )  fills you with a sense of purpose and peace . you dont like being tied down to someone elses dreams , rules , or demands .   you enjoy bingewatching netflix when youre stressed okay , a lot of people do this , but your type especially enjoys television as a stressreliever  ( according to the mbti manual )  . when youve had a bad day , you enjoy piling up some comfy pillows and blankets , gathering your favorite snacks , and having a marathon of your favorite shows .   speaking of stress , you become more critical when youre burned out normally gentle and tolerant , when youre severely stressed , your personality can change unexpectedly . you might blurt out sarcastic or critical comments at people who are bothering you or get caught up in ragefueled fantasies . often you feel like everyone else is being lazy , inefficient , or incompetent . you can find out more about your stress reaction here .   schedules feel confining for you , bedtime is when youre tired , and mealtime is when youre hungry . you follow your instincts as you go through your day rather than structuring everything out . family rituals where you have to rush through plans and schedules with a lot of other people tend to exhaust you .   you dont want to control others you hate the idea of invading anyones space  whether it be a human or an animal . your live and let live mentality makes you a goto friend for people who need space and freedom . you believe that every entity on this planet deserves personal freedom , respect , and a sense that their life is their own road to trailblaze .   later in life you find more satisfaction in order if youre in your s or s , youve probably reached a point where you can organize your tasks and projects more easily . its easy for you to lay out reasonable explanations for things and you can argue your points with veracity . when you were younger , this was much more difficult for you."

istp,"hello , i recently joined the site and have been really impressed with the level of insight shared on this forum . i was hoping someone could help me with a type i just met . my employer recently hired a new college graduate  (  years old )  to fill a vacancy and subsequently my boss asked me to train . i am a  year old male type and after getting to know him over the past month of training i am confident he is a type . we share similar hobbies and interests and just two days ago he invited me along to one of his hiking expiditions . i was really on the fence about how well he liked me as he is hard to read . since the invite , he and i both have begun to share a lot more detail about our daily lives  something he for any other person gives a typical type generic answer if asked . what brings me here looking for an answer revolves around how this particular type stares at me . for the past week , as i pass by him , i catch him out of the corner of my eye staring at me . only me . he does not do this towards others and has little interest in how others in the room are behaving . yet , it is like he watches my every move with his head tilted just enough to see me so he could turn quickly if needed . he is a bit immature still and thinks he is being slick when he does this . when i naturally turn in his direction , he quickly adjusts his head like he had no idea i was there . and his facial expression is really weird when he does this with his mouth slightly open . interestingly as of late , he has started to not pull away and we lock eyes face to face . admittedly , i too stare at times at people i am trying to size up . however , how this type stares is unlike anything i have ever encountered as my feeling trait tells me his overall body language does not correlate like he is trying to read me . then today , i again noticed through a reflection on a piece of glass he was staring at me . a few moments later he mumbled and asked me over to his work station for some help . we work in a lab and he needed to transfer some acid . he asked if i would do it . mind you , he has far more academic experience at this than i do . the task at hand did not at all need two people but i happily obliged . in fact , he had done a similiar task earlier today without me . while i was in the pouring process , he then proceeded to place his hand on the glass container to pour the solution with me . i do n ' t like to be touchy at all with someone unless i know them and this really made me uncomfortable as it just simply caught me off guard . if this had been any other coworker i would not even thought twice about it . i felt like he artificially created the task just to get near me . i have read about how a type can gaze but i was hoping someone could shed some light on why an type stares secretly when they are not upset . i hate to talk myself up but i am usually good at reading body language but he leaves me so perplexed as to his motives . am i overthinking this and was he just trying to study me ? was this a poor social attempt using his physical instinct to create a situation to try to bond ? or perhaps he has a sexual attraction towards me ? if so , i read my type personality is not one they typically like . i am curious to understand why an type would secretly stare."
esfj,"ok , so i thought i  ' d give this a bash . after having a wander through the type section i noticed their  ( sticky )  confession thread , which they themselves got the idea for in the type section . a good one to read through for both humour and , sometimes , some insight . our type section is a bit low on sticky threads , and this seems like a bit of a laugh if nothing else . so go on , post your confessions . since i  ' ve started i  ' ll go first.. . bit of a pathetic one this i admit to start with i ' m usually one of the first people in the office in the morning and i  ' ll usually race to be first to the coffee machine to get a brew going . my colleagues think i ' m being decent and helpful for doing this . reality , i secretly think they are rubbish at measuring out the correct amount of coffee , and i want to ensure i enjoy my morning coffee at the strength i like it ."
esfp,"during the school year i have been unofficially tutoring one of the elementary students that live in my neighborhood . i  ' ve typed her as an type . i could use some advice on discipline andor motivation in light of some recent problems . for context , i am an type and am doing this in a friendly , neighborly kind of way . sorry for the long post . will highlight the key points . so here are the issues academic she is now in the th grade , but reads at the st grade level .  ( her parents do not speak english , so i suspect that in the early years a lack of attention to fundamental phonics has played a role. )  she cannot sound words out very well , and usually just guesses words based on whatever the first letter is .  ( for example she would see the word basement and say basketball )  . english spelling is notoriously inconsistent , but hers is downright atrocious . it pains me to see her ask for spelling to simple words like where . she has very poor focus and usually cannot finish one question without going off on a tangent based on whatever random idea or memory has popped into her head . i have resorted to using a timer to add pressure for her to keep working . a worksheet that should take no more than  minutes takes nearly an hour and a half to complete . she is a funloving child , so i sometimes indulge her in her little side convos . during reading comprehension  multiple choice answers , she goes down the line guessing which answer may be correct , looking at my facial expression to gauge . behavioral she is extremely sensitive to criticism and downright avoidant . i offer praise whenever she tries and answers things correctly , but occasionally i will mention a systemic problem to her , and she becomes defensive . she will do anything not to hear criticism , including suddenly needing a drink of water , needing to go to the bathroom , changing the subject , etc . sometimes i let her do arts and crafts at my house . she has become so entitled to my art supplies that she thinks she needs to leave my house with a gift every time she visits . this includes her constantly asking can she have markers or cute knick knacks she finds around my home . i have a pile of paper that i reserve for little drawings and random notes . she asks if she can take two sheets home . i say yes .  minutes later she wants two more sheets . it  ' s almost opportunistic , like she feels she has to constantly finagle more . i have resorted to saying no more and more these days as i truly want her to understand that just because something is cute , does not mean that you are entitled to it . she is a sweet girl , really values her friendships and playing . she never runs out of energy to play . the problem is , no matter how much i give , it  ' s never enough . recently she asked if she could come over my house every day after school , and on the days that i am busy if i can call her and tell her that i have something else to do and let her know what is the something else . woops !  she  ( and possibly her parents at this point )  are stepping into dangerous territory . i ' m a freedomloving type , i do n ' t feel a need to be busy . just the simple fact that i am an unpaid volunteer and she is not my child is enough for me to pump the brakes on that . i do n ' t care if i have no plans at all . i would never willingly schedule away my personal time every weeknight for the entire school year . furthermore , she takes this kind of social rejection personally and starts to feel unloved . in this case , i will notice her retaliating by acting cold or playing dumb while saying intentionally hurtful things . this post has gotten long now , but if anyone has any ideas , tips , or tricks about any part of it , please let me know . i feel myself growing resentful , which is n ' t a good relationship dynamic for a child . if she were an adult , i would start my type slow fade , but she is very young . and i think some behaviors can be corrected with insight."

infj,"those doses and takes altogether come in one to never make one believe he ever approach them by himself that  ' s what he believed as far his pattern of selflove was in the domain of utility to have only its effect on selfesteem , he got himself all roundup against its gratuity , be it the sole element of himself he confused impersonally with their autonomous presentability . for example , in the same vein of separation , one chooses his line of work , well , in which he works , studying it , and the other is simply more of the work than it is akin to study . he goes pythagorician with it he studies most firstly by the name and number of all things he wants to consider in his line , same thing , and if he was not to be he concentrates on whatever does not the same as he does . he goes way above that problem , and , as he goes down again for good , he reached his method he is apt to discover he never trully wanted both conclusions . that  ' s his future is n ' t it , aloud as another  ' s more normalistic piece of work . he is now absolutely sure that whatever he wanted as not part of his future was to go against his of doing so in that sense . otherwise . an unconsumable dose of reality is a take on one  ' s future it is profoundly unreconciliable . one goes through end up exiting with two futures . if i come to really fear it for what it is against what it might not be at all , then add one of them for each possibility . this does end up into imaginatively unconsequent and unreconciliable but each time separated whole which does n ' t bend onto the force of any existent future , and in turn onto one deriving from its impossibility to exist , to complement itself an impossible breakthrough coming from an only possible unreconciliability . the uselessness of whatever goes against those doses and takes is not even of the pattern of its unpresentability , and so forth . contrarily , one  ' s selfhate is not to be reconciliable with any normalities of a piece of work if be it going to the recognizing of this pattern , and so on . open wide the gates after having closed them , yes . do n ' t close them off after having opened them out wide."

intj,"please help !  !  i want to know more about how you guys think !  we just reached a  year mark around a month ago . we are pretty compatible and happy with each other whenever we are together . we were in a longdistance relationship and i would drive to see hime twice a month and stay at his place over the weekend . as of lately , we have been arguing a lot more , mostly when we are far apart and have to call each other . we argued mostly because i was anxious due to his texting frequency has gone down quite a bit since the start of the relationship and it concerns me that his feelings for me might have changed . after the recent argument , he said to stop texting each other . he would like some time and space to think as he isnt sure if we are right for each other or not and declare of breaking up but for now . he said he would get back to me but also said if i am completely sure that i want to know his decision after some time has passed , which confuses me with his previous statement of just breaking up for now . i know for a fact that he cares for me a lot and so do i . after some time of contemplation and think back about what could have gone wrong , i texted him and tell him all of the things that i could have done better and offer lots of solution to accommodate his difficulty in the relationship , including moving closer to him and working on my anxious side . we have a snap streak going on and he wants to continue the streak so we still sending pictures so there is still somewhat of a contact . we also still share each other the location . one more thing that i am hopeful about in this situation is that he told me he has done better in one of the aspect that we had problem out of nowhere . he politely told me again that he want some time and the he just not gonna forget about me so just let him have some space and is trying to think . after i texted him all of the solutions and the fault that i made to him , i am not texting him anymore cause i already tried my best to tell him how we can work on things as best as i could . i decided to wait for him but i would like to ask everyone to understand more about the ambiguous behavior and do you think if we have a chance of reunion ? i am also confuse if he still care for me so much , then why cant it be a break but a break up for now? ? thank you for your insight."

intp,"i wanna see how this goes , since i know our minds are sporadic as ever and although many of you will try to refine your posts , i urge you not to go over and over with extensive amounts of editing . just post the little , random , complex , enlightening thought that you currently are holding in your head . mine as  approaches i have realized that i am experiencing the onset of another decade of human life passing me by . i have made it  years on this planet , gone through so many different friendships and scenarios of drama that have shaped me into quite the interesting person i am today . i have experienced heartbreak , death , depression , enlightenment , revelation , and a change in spiritual belief . my constant search for inner and outer knowledge has not changed yet the path to obtain this has wavered and been manipulated in a multitude of ways through my life . i am wondering if my interest in a career in astronomy will stay true as college approaches or will my newfound love for chemistry take over ? or will one of the random inspirational hobbies that popup in my life become my future path?"

isfj,"hello types !  in this interview , i got a chance to talk to mingdi about what it  ' s like to be an type siti scp ( b )  ff . types are rare in the personality community so it  ' s nice to hear from mingdi on how he experiences life as one . we first talked about how obvious he was lead st and how robotic he comes across . he then talked about his nt consume and how he gathers a lot of information to figure out a solution for his problems . mingdi also talked about journaling to make his feminine si solid otherwise , it makes it difficult for his ti to make a concrete conclusion or decision . we also talked about his nf play and how mingdi is interested to see what people are up to and why they made those decisions . he also talked about his double feminine sf blast and how he rarely uses it and getting started is extremely difficult for him . we also talked about him having tester sexual modalities and he always wants to try different food and restaurants . watch this interview here"
entp,"i know this looks long but i was saving from people having to click a bunch of links to articles and boiled it down instead . desthro brought up an article about adhd with regard to my organizing things that interest me but neglectingforgetting about every day organization . as i read the article , it made me really think about how much adhd symptoms are so similar to type personality traits  ( usually described as our weaknesses )  , how can you tell what is a disease and what is having neti in the front positions . i have never been officially diagnosed but i suspect i might be adhd however , i have always been able to use life hacks to function pretty well , even as a child . i am forgetfuldisorganized but very responsible  ( probably more responsible than most types )  and my inability to sit still has usually been used for good rather than evil  ( helping other people rather than just disrupting )  . really though , am i adhd or an type with high ne ? anyway , here is a list of adhd symptoms vs . type traits adhd lack of focus possibly the most telltale sign of adhd , lack of focus goes beyond trouble paying attention . it means being easily distracted , finding it hard to listen to others in a conversation , overlooking details , and not completing tasks or projects . the flip side to that is hyperfocus  ( see below )  . hyperfocus while people with adhd are often easily distractible , they may also have something called hyperfocus . a person with adhd can get so engrossed in something that they can become unaware of anything else around them . this kind of focus makes it easier to lose track of time and ignore those around you . this can lead to relationship misunderstandings . disorganization life can seem chaotic for everyone at times , but someone with adhd typically has a more hectic life experience on a regular basis . this can make it difficult to keep everything in its right place . an adult with adhd may struggle with these organizational skills . this can include problems keeping track of tasks and trouble prioritizing them in a logical manner . time management problems this issue goes handinhand with disorganization . adults with adhd often have trouble using their time effectively . they may procrastinate on important tasks , show up late for important events , or ignore assignments they consider boring . they may have trouble focusing on the future or the past  the now is often more topofmind for them . forgetfulness its human to forget things occasionally , but for someone with adhd , forgetfulness is a part of everyday life . this can include routinely forgetting where youve put something or what important dates you need to keep . impulsivity impulsiveness in someone with adhd can manifest in several ways interrupting others during conversation being socially inappropriate rushing through tasks acting without much consideration to the consequences . lack of motivation while you might be open to doing everything at once , you also may feel unmotivated . coupled with procrastination and poor organizational skills , this problem can make it difficult for an adult with adhd to finish a project because they cant focus for long periods of time . restlessness and anxiety as an adult with adhd , you may feel like your motor wont shut off . your yearning to keep moving and doing things can lead to frustration when you cant do something immediately . this leads to restlessness , which can lead to frustration and anxiety . types  . they love change . types are always looking for something new and gets bored with routine and having possessions with them for a long time . once something else comes along , they get distracted . this is also evident in the way they handle relationships that they tend to hop from one relationship to another .  . they easily get bored with people and things . when they feel a friend is not able to help them in a positive way or is not being a good influence , they are open to letting go and move forward . moreover , despite their being innovators , once they lose interest on what they do , they end up leaving them unfinished .  . they are risktakers . this can be a weakness at times for types since they often do things without thinking twice of the outcome . these can include financial risks like starting businesses because they find them interesting at first .  . they love arguments . types enjoy asking questions and asking the views of other people that it often ends up in a debate . simply because they want to understand things and look at a situation from different perspectives , other people see them as confrontational , making big things out of trivial matters . this can affect their relationships with other people . whats ironic is that they only want to understand things more clearly .  . they have the tendency to have unfinished jobs . the faster types get excited with new things that interest them , the faster they lose their passion on them when things begin to be a routine . when they are not happy with what they do , they lose the drive to stay on it and will want to leave and do something else .  . an type may show some a lack of sensitivity to the feelings and ways of those who might need reassurance , security or commitment . for those of you that have been officially diagnosed , how is adhd different than just being an type?"

enfp,"im reading a neuroscience book about the power of meditation andor prayer and what it can do for your brain even when you arent religious . some of the takehome tips about meditation suggested are that focusing the mind on your spiritual goals each day can have the effects of increased memory , less anxiety , slower to anger or irritate , better social awareness , noticeably quicker ability to solve tasks , to name a few . they tossed the idea of spiritual goals out there without describing what spiritual goals are . i have been very religious most of my life and used to have quite transformative experiences with prayer , so this morning i wanted to pray like i used to . no , i havent been praying , a few years ago i decided it was useless as i no longer am a believer and have not been able to get my belief back , despite prayer . i figure the things i mentioned in my prayer this morning might be considered spiritual goalshere is my prayer from this morning help me to feel healthy enough to help my patients today . help my secretary and i to get along  ( shes been mad that ive been off sick of course it makes a lot of extra stress and work for her )  . help me to figure out how to make my kids feel loved this christmas and figure out what to do for them  ( presents , christmas atmosphere , etc. )  i guess those are spiritual goals ? for me my connections with otherswhat i give out to others ? i cant imagine what else would be but just like this book says every single person has a very unique take on god  ( it doesnt matter if they are in the same religion one will focus on him as an vengeful cosmic force , the next like a loving human parent , another a spirit from within )  use very different language to describe spiritual experiences and how incredibly surprising this was to the researchers i bet each person would have a very unique take on their spiritual goals . would you be willing to share yours with meus ? i would love to get an idea of what this means for others . thank you and well wishes !

estj,"hello types !  in this interview , i got a chance to talk to all the exxj types about their shared experiences and what makes them different from one another . during the interview , we talked about exxjs having trouble making a decision for themselves and needing permission from the tribe before making decisions . we also talked about te shaming ti and fe shaming fi . savannah asked an awesome question to the type and types on how te  ' s can be more sensitive to ti  ' s and not offend them . we also discussed what their ti or fi swing looks like when they go on a selfishness swing . we also discussed racist jokes and how they perceived it as an exxj . we also talked about blood and family ties and how the type and type perceived it differently from the type and type . double observing was something we tried discussing but the topic was too boring for the exxjs to continue talking about because it  ' s so easy for them . in the end , the exxjs had a message to say to fellow exxjs on how to better themselves as individuals . some things i noticed about each participant include julia  ( type and our only infodominant exxj )  did an amazing job maintaining the flow of the conversation being balanced with her sife and neti . maggie  ( our jumper type )  was relatively quiet and focused on gathering the tribe  ' s perspective . rob  ( our jumper type with double activated ti and token male exxj )  was acting very exxp like with committing to decisions . savannah  ( our jumper type )  asked some very good questions to the lead fe  ' s . nina  ( our jumper type and only lead nt )  was doing a makeshift double decider which shows how present that masculine fi is at the bottom when double activated . natalie  ( our type and only mf )  produced many hilarious moments including before the interview with her blast to nina just seconds after learning something from julia . and finally , heather shows the big difference between an type and type when it comes to dealing with presenting themselves to the tribe . i also thought it was interesting that julia being infodominant was not as scared of how the tribe perceived her as the energy dominants were . julia said she can clarify with the tribe which shows the easy flow of information while natalie said she never thought of asking the tribe and just assumed everyone hated her . watch this interview here"
isfj,"hello , i was wondering.. . does it ever happen to you to check others '  opinions , conclusions just to confirm your own , feel more confident ? do you ever have those wait...it does n ' t make sense...is it really...should n ' t it...maybe this.. . and look at others '  comments to be more confident ? validate your thoughts ? a few days ago , i was watching an article comparing dogs to know which one is the strongest , i figured maybe it  ' s their physique as well as the strength of their bites.. . but at the same time , i still checked the conclusion instead of just calling it a day after my theory . and it can happen quite a lot to me.. . does that happen to you ? frequently ? thanks in advance !

isfj,im an social outcast and always have been . there is no two ways about it when i say im definitely introverted . i suffer from social phobia and selective mutism  . i enjoy the solitude of being by myself some days but feel very very alone on other days . i dont feel like i really fit into society . i have very few if any good friends outside of cyberspace . i have never been in a relationship  ( serious or casual for that matter )  . dating and finding somebody to spend the rest of my life with seem to be pipe dreams that are out of my reach at this point . im very prone to feeling depressed and lonely . in the past i have thought about ending my life because i hurt so much on the inside from being such an outcast from society . i can speak freely online and socialize with people . the one thing i long for the most is human touch . talking to people online isnt the same as having an heart to heart in person with them . there is almost nothing i would not give for the opportunity of cuddling and snuggling up to a person . i just want to love and be loved . can any of my fellow type  ' s relate or am i just the exception to the rule?sad
esfp,"first of all , if you  ' re about to post you  ' re a typist !  go away , it wo n ' t help anybody . observations i see types as potsmoking guys who do n ' t care about anything but their friends and themselves . in their s , they may start to care about things like corporations and the government or other righteous things . they love to party , preferably with their friends , a close group of friends or their friends , but do n ' t mind strangers . partying sometimes includes other drugs rather than weed , combined with lots and lots of alcohol . likely to be smokers as they wanted to be cool . generous , would share a chocolate that costs kg that he just got from his grandma overseas with a friend  ' s friend just because he  ' s there with him at that moment . ca n ' t be trusted to do something they promise , likely to just forget it . may even skip a class because they forgot about it , or a driving lesson , even if it costs  to retake it and they do n ' t have it . do n ' t know if the following is countryspecific , but do n ' t like to work , unless it  ' s illegal and relatively easy . very impulsive , prefer to set schedule  minutes before it happens , an hour tops . oddly , when young seem to want some kind of fame , but that may be mistaken for the wish to be accepted . due to their social skills and rather charming personality , some may consider them a leader , assuming it  ' s a group of friends . always have a story to tell , whether their own or someone else  ' s . often it  ' s someone else  ' s though . pay attention to the stories of others , if it  ' s happened to someone else , it  ' s the truth . sort people into respected and disrespected , depending on how their interests match . have a moral code , once an type even gave back what he stole from a guy in an online game because he felt bad about it . loves animals , may stop and pet a stray dog or a cat on the street . do n ' t mind stuff that may harm them , life is short , live good , die young kinda folks . do n ' t mind getting lost in thought when doing something , so concentration skills . when under stress may be violent or do immoral stuff , like stealing from the less respected friends or insulting them . do n ' t mind making fun of friends or others as long as it  ' s between friends . neglect any logical discussion unless it  ' s oneonone . a partner leaving them may cause great stress that can last even for a month or a bit more and may lead into morethanusual drug abuse . do n ' t like talking about love or romance , especially if it  ' s related to them . may annoy the hell out of an type by asking countless why ? questions about stuff that i see as intuitive and if i take the time to explain it , may just stick a too serious sticker on it . great activity partners  gaming , whether computer or realworld and sports . i bet that part of the observations are either generalizations or unrelated , so feel free to comment or post your observations and discuss."
infj,"unfortunately , as an type , we will always feel like outsiders . it  ' s important to understand though , that this is because we are a minority in the population , and not because there is something wrong with us or those who struggle to connect with us . but there are things we can do to help deal with this . be authentic . mirroring other people too much , not saying what we want to say . these are defense mechanisms we fall back on because we feel so different . and it  ' s not just in our heads . we  ' ve seen how people respond when we are ourselves . the puzzled looks , or even  ' you  ' re crazy '  comments . the problem is relying on doing these things actually increases our feelings of alienation . it  ' s much better to say what your really thinking , and be your authentic self even if you get blowback for doing so . this helps because being authentic helps people better understand who we really are , which gives them a better chance at connecting with us . it  ' s also very cathartic in being ourselves . we get to be who really want to be or say what we really want to say , which helps us feel less ashamed of ourselves . understand people do n ' t necessarily think your weird , they just ca n ' t connect with you , like how you ca n ' t connect with them remember its a two way street . do n ' t like small talk ? well the other person probably does n ' t like talking about some obscure abstract subject  seconds after meeting for the first time . they want to hear about your ni discoveries as much as you want to hear about their si past . the disconnect we feel with others , they feel that with us . they do n ' t dislike us , they just cant connect with us . remember how many people like you as an type , it  ' s very likely you are almost universally liked by everyone you spend an significant amount of time with . however you probably feel like you are always liked , but never loved . remember that feeling is more connected to our desire for deep relationships . when people around us only interact with us on a surface level , it makes us feel unworthy . why do n ' t people want a deep connection with me ? remember that these people have this type of connection with almost everyone else . they are n ' t singling you out . they dont have deep connections with dozens of people , but refuse to have a deep connection with you . try not to take it personally . we may want a deep connection , but the majority of people do n ' t . also remember we do n ' t necessarily want a deep connection with everyone either . in addition , its difficult for most people to foster a deep connection with us , because , well , they ca n ' t connect with us . this hurts , but try your best not to let it bother you too much . find that one deep connection the good news is , for most types , we really just need one deep connection in our life and we  ' re set . whether its a close friend , or a romantic partner , keep looking for someone who likes you the way you are and meets the needs you are looking for . remember , it only takes one."
infj,"hey friends . i ' m at a point right now where i am truly wondering how those of you types fortunate enough to find yourself in fulfilling relationships managed to luck out as you did ? i ask this because it seems that iwe are so difficult to match with another that we happen to care for . perhaps it  ' s just me. . i  ' ve found that few individuals i  ' ve fallen for in my life , i  ' ve just been too much too handle . or just a bit too passionate . never intentionally , but my care for someone once feelings are realized just goes from  to  very quickly , without much in between , and once it  ' s there it  ' s hard to conceal . i want to make that person feel special and appreciated . although i do n ' t admit it , internally i become idealistic about what we can bebecome . it begins like a dream of sorts , and then it very slowly , and then very quickly becomes a nightmare , because that person has historically always pulled away when they realize this , rather than embraced it . my fear of rejection kicks in when intuition says it  ' s taken a turn for the worst , and it just does not end well . it  ' s a cycle that  ' s repeated , less and less frequently , but in much more painful ways each time . and my hope for things dwindles to the point of just wanting to surrender my heart on a plate . each time a very different kind of person , but the same end result . no matter the approach . things just have n ' t clicked on both ends . on top of this. . i  ' ve never had anyone  ( that i  ' ve noticed )  full on pursue me , not since i was young . nobody that  ' s cared to the point that i could feel and sense it . i  ' ve historically had a couple of crushes cautiously reciprocate interest until in due time it  ' s diminished . but i  ' ve never been made to feel like anyone  ' s number one , like i could walk away and they would follow me . i do n ' t expect the intensity i will sometimes give , but i  ' d hope for something more , and in my  years it  ' s never come . i  ' ve always been the one leaving the door open , hoping . and after everything falls apart , i ' m the one making some plea that they do n ' t walk away . but they always do . and it destroys my world inside . i ca n ' t even listen to comments like keep your chin up , you deserve someone great , because at this point it feels almost cruel . like i ' m being mocked . see , it  ' s not an easy thing any more . it affects your perception of selfworth and makes you question it , no matter how much you fight it . each time the other person walks away , when they meant the world to you , and you loved them unconditionally . it  ' s even more brutal when they said that everything you gave to them was everything they wanted from a guy . i ca n ' t tell you how much that affects you , especially this far into life , when all you want is your life story to start to be something normal . something that invokes a smile , instead of a sorrowful and confused look . when you have such a reservoir of love and care , and nowhere to put it...your life is like an equation that just does n ' t add up . things you see in the movies , where a happy coincidence turns into someone who changes your life forever . that shit does n ' t happen . not for me . i  ' ve been more alone than i  ' d ever wish on anyone . people do n ' t drop in to save the day , or just sit with me , take my hand when i feel i have nothing . it  ' s a one man battle . i have a family that does n ' t get me , and has always severely under appreciated my views or my contributions . so i  ' ve always fended for myself in a way . i  ' ve had no one on my team , who  ' s believed in me and loved me for who i am , to this day . it  ' s all i  ' ve ever wanted . and after being so optimistic in all my time growing up that everyone deserves and is destined to meet their happiness at some point , whatever that may be , i ' m having my doubts that it will happen . i just do n ' t see it . it  ' s cold and bleak , and lonely . and i do n ' t know what to do anymore . dating sites , all that crap , it feels fruitless and it normally is , because that small talk , coming onto strangers is awkward and unnatural to us . iwe do n ' t work that way . and the real world is full of people cautious and unwilling to find out what you  ' re all about , because you do n ' t exude that social prowess or outward charisma that will get them out of their seat for you . establishing new social connections is an extremely difficult process , and no one usually cares enough to walk through all those lengthy steps . there  ' s just no one walking through that door and i ' m not sure there ever will be . can anyone relate?"

esfj,"not going to lie , when i check on these threads and things move soooooooo slowly and there  ' s like nothing new ever.. . i ' m totally like i wish orionuk and suntide and any other types out there were here to just catch up . like how  ' s everyone  ' s day going or whatever else is on your mind . ha !  i ' m such an type.. . lol"
isfj,"i met an type on an app . i ' m an type . we mostly took it in turns to initiate . met up a few times and messaged everyday even if it was just a few messages . then at one point he got sick , i checked in on him but gave him some space because he was sick . i did n ' t hear from him in a few days and sent a message to ask if i  ' d done something wrong . he responded that i had n ' t done anything wrong , he said i could text him whenever i wanted and that he would too  ( but he has n ' t )  . conversation went back to normal but it was me initiating all the time . i decided to stop , its been  days and i have n ' t heard anything from him . i do n ' t want to reach out again in case he found someone else and lost interest in me but is too afraid to say . although he  ' s always been a shy overthinker , i ' m not sure why he suddenly stopped initiating . i ' m really hurt to be honest . the first time it happened i expressed i was hurt that he  ' d gone cold , he said he was just being cautious . i ' m worried we are just never going to talk again . i ' m left just wondering what happened and wondered if any types could give me insight."
istj,"out of these types series , which do you prefer and why ? if other , state what that might be."
esfj,"when an type goes in the grip from being overloaded at work , and becomes closed up and stops communicating with a best friend , do they still think about that friend with the same frequency ? do they miss that friend in the same way like they would have if they were n ' t stressed out ? after they return back to normal , do they usually wish to resume the friendship just like it was before ? do they feel regret for distancing so much from that friend when they were stressed out?"

esfp,"if you  ' ve ever interacted at length with other types  what were the main similarities and differences that you personally noticed between you ? i learn best by examples , do please enlighten me crazy"
istj,"i am placing these list from susan storms website . you should not use this list in an attempt to determine your type . instead the list is being placed here for discussion among type types or compare list with other types that you may want to compare and contrast .  . you use your past as a guide for the future as you go through life , you consider it your moral obligation to learn from each experience , whether its a failure or a success . you collect these experiences and recall them when a crisis hits or a solution is needed to a problem . that said , if youre in an unhealthy phase of life , you might get hooked on bad habits from your past  enjoying the comfort or thrill of these habits and wanting to relive them even if they have negative consequences .  . you remember the facts and details of past experiences well you have a gift for remembering little details and experiences from the past . because of this , you quickly notice changes and shifts . for example , if you walk into a room , you might be the first to notice that the furniture has been rearranged . you also might notice if someones body language differs from their typical composure and sense that something isnt right .  . you crave a sense of routine unpredictable situations are anathema to you , so you try to have a clear direction for your day . usually you have a calendar planned out and a daily flow that helps you to know what to expect and when . this sense of routine and consistency puts you at ease and gives you the freedom to think clearly .  . you enjoy reliving your favorite memories all types enjoy reminiscing from time to time , but you seem to have a special affinity for it . you can close your eyes and recall a past memory and feel as if you are really living and breathing it . the past comes to life in vivid detail and lush imagery . you can even enter a state of flow through this process . find out more things you enjoy in  things that excite the type personality type .  . following through on your word is a huge priority for you because being consistent and dependable is so crucial to you , people know that they can depend on you to mean what you say and do what you say youll do . letting someone down or forgetting a responsibility makes you feel intense shame and frustration .  . you experience dj vu a lot because your memory for details and experiences is so remarkable , you quickly make connections between what is happening now and what happened in the past . small similar experiences or sights can give you a sudden , unexpected feeling of dj vu . people of your type frequently mention having this sensation on a regular basis .  . you postprocess experiences to enjoy them fully when youre experiencing something new you tend to feel a little detached from it  as if experiencing the full weight of the present moment would be overwhelming . however , after the experience is over you often replay it in your mind  enjoying the beauty of it more after the fact than during . which leads to our next point  . you beat yourself up over past mistakes because youre always trying to learn from your mistakes and you have a tendency to postprocess experiences , you have a tendency to replay embarrassing or awkward moments in your head . you might lie in bed at night beating yourself up over mistakes you made  or  years ago , feeling as if the shame and frustration of it all is happening in the present .  . you try to have a calm , composed manner loud , brash , overreactive people tend to annoy you . you respect people who can maintain a sense of composure and control , even in trials and tribulations . you try to maintain an air of professionalism and coolness in any situation that presents itself .  . you quickly sense changes in patterns because youre so aware of details , facts , and past experiences , you quickly notice unexpected changes or shifts in behavior . this makes you keenly attuned to changes in patterns or inconsistencies in people .  . you get a strong sense of satisfaction from crossing items off your todo list productivelyminded , you get a thrill from crossing items off a tasklist . you get a surge of joy from knowing your projects are being completed and you dont have to worry about them anymore .  . competence is crucial to you being competent and being surrounded by competent people is vital to your wellbeing . finishing tasks on time , being logical , and responding with a coolheaded manner to any crisis gives you a sense of wellbeing and confidence . this can make you a highly respected leader  ( check out the type leader to see more about this )  .  . fairness and justice are core values of yours you hate preferential treatment and believe that solid rules and regulations should be applied to all people without bias . that said , you believe clarifying the rules and making sure they are just , fair , and reasonable is crucial . you will fight relentlessly to tear down rules you see as oppressive or unjust .  . youre skeptical of overt displays of emotion when people are emotionally reactive , cloying , or effusive , you tend to get suspicious . what do they want ? are they emotionally okay ? can you trust them ? why is their eye twitching ? why are they crying ? why cant they calm down ?  . youre a realist more than an idealist you have core values that you strive to uphold no matter the odds . but even with that in mind , you consider yourself a realist more than a dreamer . you want to know the facts and avoid having your mind clouded by theories and emotions that might cloud your ability to see the reality of a situation clearly .  . be prepared !  is your motto you create plans and contingency plans for the future so that no matter what happens you will have a solution readily available . people count on you for your ability to organize and present alternative plans when a disaster occurs . that said , if a situation comes up that youre unprepared for , you tend to feel trapped and overwhelmed . you need to get away to a quiet place so that you can devise a solution .  . youre skilled in the art of logistics you seem to innately know how to organize people and objects in the most efficient way . getting things done on time , getting people where they need to be , and handling many moving pieces is something you have the capability to do with nearly unmatched skill .  . you have perseverance if you put your energy into something , you see no virtue in bowing out before youve given  of your energy to it . you put a tremendous amount of willpower into every action you take .  . when youre stressed , you see dozens of negative possibilities normally focused and grounded , when youre severely stressed you tend to flip a switch and become filled with visions of doom and gloom . you see all the ways that your plans could unravel and all the potential security risks that lie ahead of you .  . you despise pretention people who craft elaborate phrases with superfluous words tend to get on your nerves . people who try to appear like philosophers , gurus , or experts without the life experience to back it up make your skin crawl .  . you put facts before personal feelings youve made it a top priority to place truth on a higher level of respect than emotions . your heart or feelings might be swaying you one way , but you know the facts are pointing in another direction . except in really crucial situations , youll follow the facts over the feelings in a situation .  . you hate the idea of compromising your values what few people know except those closest to you is that you have a deep set of unchangeable values . you know what you believe to be right and wrong and you wont compromise that for anything . you strive to stay true to your sense of integrity regardless of what the crowd is doing or what is popular at the moment .  . change makes you anxious you prioritize a carefully crafted routine that you can count on no matter what life throws at you . you crave the familiar , the quiet , and the sense of continuity that comes from having a set schedule . unexpected changes make you nervous and rattled .  . you hate clashing sensory details being in bright , chaotic environments or being around people who are wearing clashing patterns can make you feel uneasy and queasy . you like the things around you to be organized , calm , and aesthetically pleasing . when the details around you clash , you have an insatiable urge to fix them . this can make you seem a little obsessive and nitpicky to people who dont share your tendencies."

isfj,"hello types !  in this interview , i got a chance to talk to every single ixxj type  ( both standard and jumper variations )  talk about their fears , similarities , and differences . lindsay  ( type )  asked her fellow ixxjs how their fears physically manifest in their body . lynda  ( type jumper )  asked how being tribe above self affects the ixxjs first function . avis  ( type jumper )  asked how to prevent other people  ' s chaos from affecting themselves . rose  ( type )  asked how their sexual modalities change the experience of their first function . kevin  ( type )  asked fellow ixxjs how they experience relationships . joyce  ( type jumper )  asked which part of their ops code they related to the most . jamie  ( type )  asked what was the most useful thing they learned when they got their type back . cherie  ( type jumper )  did n ' t have any questions . some of the big moments in the interview is when rose discovered the pattern that those that have feminine as their first function tend to be more paranoid or neurotic than those that have a masculine first function . i also learned that containers holding liquids with faulty lids are the bane of an ixxjs existence because they end up spilling the liquid everywhere . and interestingly , many ixxjs plan their exxp moment by going on vacation and acting like an exxp when they are not home . watch this interview here"
esfj,"hello types !  in this panel interview , i got a chance to do a panel interview with personality types that all have introverted thinking , extroverted feeling , introverted sensing , and extroverted intuition in their function stack . rose  ( type )  , drew  ( type )  , isaac  ( type )  , evelien  ( type jumper )  , and viktoria  ( type )  , all shared how they personally experience their si , ne , fe , and ti . we started the interview with si and rose , evelien , and drew all think their si function is boring . to isaac and viktoria , they like their si because it gives them a sense of calm . isaac said that your physical space reflects your mind and if you declutter your physical space then you are also decluttering your mind . next , we jumped into the topic of ne and gathering information . we talked about fe and ti at the end because those two functions were very interesting . during the interview , we discussed using fe for good and using fe for evil . rose gave one of the best description of how masculine fe works and how other people  ' s negative emotions gets stuck on her and how she needs to use her ti to reduce the damage to her mental health as a result of her masculine fe . isaac and everyone else confirmed that with feminine fe , once they are not in the presence of a person suffering , that feeling does n ' t linger . drew mentioned that for him , fe is more the suffering of groups instead of individuals . finally , we got to ti at the end and talked about everyone  ' s identity . some questions i asked them includes how te shames ti  ( in which drew gave some very funny examples being married to someone that is lead te )  . isaac also gave a funny example of lead te  ' s using his idea and using it as just one idea as oppose to the idea to implement . i ended the interview by asking everyone about fe gift giving since the stereotype of lead fe is they like giving fruit baskets as a gift or a similar concept as presents to people . watch this interview here"
enfj,"there is a very outgoing female coworker who recently started working at the university  ( different department , same building )  . she is quite attractive and appears to be very selfassured , pleasant , and gives off an impression of being outspoken and easygoing around people . however , when she first began working here , we would occasionally cross paths in the corridor , yet she would n ' t acknowledge me . so , i decided to take the initiative and introduce myself . things went smoothly  we engaged in some small talk . however , despite this , she continued to be a bit distant and chilly whenever we passed each other in the corridor , occasionally even ignoring me . as a result , i eventually gave up and moved on . surprisingly , several weeks later , she came up to me while i was with a group of colleagues at a university event and remarked ,  ' oh , you  ' re here, '  initiating a conversation exclusively with me . from that point on , whenever she encounters me , she seems genuinely enthusiastic to greet me . this positive shift made me to consider asking her out . coincidentally , we sometimes take the same train home and have started sitting across from each other during the commute . however , during these train rides , she once again appears a bit perplexed  ( which is contradictory to her behavior at work with colleagues )  . she seems nervous , fidgety , and distant when we  ' re seated across from each other . i even have an intuitive sense that she might be feeling uncomfortable . yet , back within the university environment , she engages in teasing when we meet in the corridor , playfully mimicking my behavior . often she is at the other end of the corridor , always waving at me when she sees me . sometimes , she even passes by my office , pauses for a moment , and greets me with a cheerful  ' helloooo , insert my name. '  however , as soon as i turn around to respond , she simply smiles at me and quickly hurries away . i ' m left wondering whether this pattern of behavior aligns with common traits of an type personality . i ' m posing this question because i  ' ve developed an interest in her and would like to ask her out . however , her behavior on the train is somewhat confuses me."
isfj,"do you like watching movies , types ? yesterday i watched odd thomas and i found it very interesting . i think thomas has some characters of type like batman in batman series . the film is about the good and the bad with mixed events which could guide the audiences to follow the main actors misleading thoughts . this film has a lot of emotional and thrilling materials that touch my senses . overall , the movie has decent actorsactresses and astonishing end  ( except some violent and scary scenes which you might be afraid of and  predictable culprit )  . my judgment "
esfj,"there are  matches for an type and i  ' ve changed my mind . i previously thought type was the best match for an type but now i believe it is type and let me tell you why.. . type and type are most compatible with type and type . briefly , each nickname is as follows type the artist , the aesthete , the adventurer , the artisan , the dancer type the child , the daydreamer , the quester , the poet , the idealist type the teacher , the coach , the protagonist , the guru , the giver , the mentor type the nanny , the consul , the shadow , the advice giver , the protector , the provider , the supporter , the bodyguard here  ' s what i ' m thinking the type  ( child )  goes naturally with the type  ( nanny )  and the type  ( dancer )  goes best with the type  ( coach )  . plus , the type and type share si in common and the type and type share se in common so i think its better to have the senses of the past and present in harmony with each other . maybe you are an type and disagree and if so there are  other options...which is your favorite ? type or this one that says all  type a . type b . type c . type d . type"
isfj,"i have some types in my life who i love  but some of the things they do and say drive me insane , often to the point where even though i love them i strongly dislike the way they behave . for example , my mother is an type . i know she loves me , but she  ' s suffocating me . she has me wrapped up in cotton wool , and whenever i try and tell her i ' m capable of looking after myself , she gets very upset and tells me   ' she  ' s just showing that she cares '  . i appreciate that she cares , and i tell her this , but i would like her to appreciate that i ca n ' t be happy without my independence . i may live at home , but i am a grown women  (  )  . it gets worse when she  ' s stressed . she  ' ll suddenly take on a whole new personality  when i was a little girl  ( about seven )  i used to describe her to my friends as  ' good mom '  and  ' bad mom '  . good mom was loved to laugh , and kindly corrected me if i did something wrong  i was a very good girl , and anything i did wrong was completely unintentional . bad mom was completely irrational  if i accidentally did something wrong , something good mom would normally laugh about , bad mom would scream at me or hit me . of course , she does n ' t hit me anymore , but the screaming has gotten worse . only recently have i been standing up for myself , telling her that there  ' s no rational reason for her to be acting this way , that it  ' s unfair for her to take her stress out on me when i  ' ve done nothing wrong . if i make a logical , valid argument ,  ( and do n ' t get me wrong , i ' m always polite about it )  , she either slams the door in my face and walks out , or uses the  ' i ' m so tortured card '   ( i ' m so stressed , and you  ' re not , but you are adding to my stress in some indirect way , therefore i have every right to scream at you )  . and the worst part ? she goes on for hours , sometimes even days , and the entire  ' argument '  can usually be summed up into a single paragraph  she just rewords and repeats until she  ' s left breathless . and when she  ' s out of breath ? she sulks , and snaps , and ignores me . i feel like it makes her feel a little bit better if she can make everyone feel as miserable as she feels . it does n ' t make any sense because i am very , very careful never to do anything wrong . i always try to be polite , honest , modest , gentle , helpful , kind  everything a daughter should be . her argument for her actions are usually something along the lines of  ' i ' m stressed because you have n ' t cleaned the bathroom this week '   she has never asked me to clean the bathroom in my life . how should i know ? so then i  ' ll offer a compromise  of course , i  ' ll go and it now !  how about i start doing it once a week from now on ? but that  ' s never what she wants to hear . she  ' ll reply with something like  ' it  ' s too late now !  i  ' ve already done it . i wanted it done yesterday . then why did n ' t she tell me yesterday ? because i should have thought to be helpful on my own accord , of course !  and so the argument goes round in circles . basically , how do i deal with the irrational , emotional side of this type without moving out ? because i know moving out right now would break her heart , but i have to do something . i do not get depressed or upset easily , but my mother leaves me awake crying at night  and that  ' s something not many types can admit to . she is the only person to make me cry in the past  years  ( besides a breakup with a boyfriend  years ago )  , and somehow she constantly manages to depress me . i need to find a way to deal with her , or i  ' ll have to leave . can anyone help?"
estp,"you  ' d be like what ? types and selfsacrifice ? types are the least sacrificing kind of the mbti chart.. . well , yeah , technically . but there is a surprising amount of examples in popular fiction of types who sacrifice themselves for something . even in little things , but there comes a time when something just comes out of the types . a hidden shadow maybe ? if you think about it , it makes sense . type  ' s shadow are type . and just as type  ' s shadow comes out every once in a while , the type in type might do the same . anyway , here are the examples . han solo from star wars  ( technically , his death star save is n ' t a sacrifice , but still counts as heroism as he did n ' t have to do it , so it  ' s also some kind of awakening of the type shadow )  steve stifler from american pie  ( the context being , he has to involve in gay sex to watch the girls '  show go further and if you know anything about stifler , you know , it  ' s the farthest thing from his mind  yet , he  ' s taking one for the team )  mike from until dawn  ( this gets me every time )   there  ' s a better version of this though i could n ' t find  ( disturbing )  seth saves evan from superbad and finally , thor sacrificing himself for the weapon that can kill thanos i wanted to include other examples but that  ' s all i could find . anyway . what do you think ? my idea is that anyone with strong se and fe would be willing to be selfsacrificing from time to time .  ( i might add , types do the same but in a less theatrical fashion . think jack bauer , james bond , every jb cooper from interstellar who literally jumps down a black hole , or solid snake...etc ) "
istj,"i as an type would like to know what you all think of every typological type i encourage you to be as specific as you wish ( using type combos or other particularalities , etc. ) "
enfj,"hello everyone , i am an type . for me , friends are either very close , or they are merely an acquaintance . my close friends are usually type , type , and type . there is something i love about nf  ' s . i have been wondering why i have n ' t had any close friends who are type . i have two potential friends at the moment who are types . i feel their nfness , which makes me want to become closer friends . but , it is almost as if they do n ' t have this need . is this true ? do type  ' s not really need close friends ? they seem to have lots of friends , on a mediumlevel . they connect to people easily , and they are not superficial , but they do n ' t seem to go as deep as types.. . they stop at a certain level . are they happy with this level ? are type  ' s very conscious of what behaviour is appropriate , and what is inappropriate ? how important to you is acting appropriately ? i think that the ip vs . ej difference i feel means that we are different in our impressions of what is appropriate.. . you have fe first . i have fi first . we both want to please people because we are nf  ' s . but , this desire is different.. . i have no desire to conform . i take pleasure in being different , thinking outside of the box , and finding my own rules for everything in life . whereas type  ' s are more aware of the box.. . they are more aware of what is appropriate . and they seem to expect me to act inside the box.. . something like that ? and their ti.. . does your ti allow you to avoid topics ? does it allow you to steer conversations into a direction that you feel more comfortable with ? i try to be direct , addressing something inappropriately intense . and she just steers it to where she feels comfortable.. . something like that . i would love to hear what you think of types , and if you can explain the difference between them . i would be grateful for any insight you have . i would love to be close friends with an type because i feel it would help me understand the whole range of nfness . however , maybe they just are n ' t the close friend type , at least not according to my definition of close friend . if they are n ' t , i am probably better to just give up on this idea , and just let them be the mediumlevel friend they want to be."
entp,"types , i ' m looking for some help . i really want to work on my thinking and logic . i find myself in trouble and hurting people because i make decisions based almost entirely on how i feel . i really do n ' t want to keep ruining my relationships with people . i form them easily , but ca n ' t maintain them when i hurt people . what sort of filters do you use to process your thoughts before you make decisions ? anyone can answer this , but i figured if t was all i changed , i would most resemble an type."

esfp,"note i had posted this a few months ago on the type forum , however i didnt get as much feedback as i would have liked , so i thought i would post it here too !  this is directed at any other male type  ' s on this forum , or any female type  ' s that have been in this situation.. . have any of you ever been in relationships with a female typemale type ? i , for one have been in relationships with more than one female type and neither of them have worked out . i  ' ve always felt like female types have been drawn to me , although i ' m not quite sure why . at first , i always seem to connect magnificantly with the female type . there warm , bubbly , fun loving personality usually puts me at ease and really helps me be myself , and at first i really find myself enjoying spending time with the type and generally connecting wonderfully on an emotional level . but ofcourse , as time goes on , it always becomes more and more apparant that things arent going to work out . i become to needy , paranoid , controlling and serious . especially if the type i ' m in a relationship with likes to flirt a bit with other guys . types like to be spontanious and types like to plan , that is usually another problem . i have also found that types cannot take the slightest bit of criticism . even if its constructive they view it as a personal attack on their character , there emotional outburts are really hard to deal with . although being an type , i am also guilty of outbursts of anger . i ' m just wondering if there are any other male types out there that have been in relationships , or have found themselves drawn to female types . or anyone who can help shed some light on to why things just did n ' t work out . i get on really well with a healthy type and i was wondering if there is anything i can do to make a relationship with them work ? !  what  ' s the secret to making a healthy female type happy ? thanks x"

isfp,"i remember reading that type  ' s are often very competitive . that was one of the few things that did n ' t make sense to me . but then i thought about my childhood . i remember losing more than winning . i remember it really bothering me too . it  ' s not like the desire to win was n ' t there . i remember in sports i always had plenty of strength , speed , and endurance , more than most . the problem was that i have poor coordination , and i have a slow reaction time . so anyways , i think i just got sick of caring and being butthurt about losing  ( not just in sports )  . so i fell asleep . well , almost . i still feel the remnants of my lame type competitiveness . but then that  ' s when i basically in my subconscious realize but oh yeah , i ' m not gonna do a damn thing about this . so i  ' ll just forget about it now . snore  do any other type  ' s here feel uncompetitive mostly ? does anyone know uncompetitive type  ' s ? did youthey get that way in a similar way as i did?"
esfp,"dating an type for almost two months has been challenging . but there  ' s also psychological understanding and attraction between us so it is n ' t onesided . when we talk about hobbies , arts , and places it can be extremely comfortable and enjoyable . however , i ' m not truly sure if this young man wants to be serious with me . we are only in our early twenties and i do n ' t have that much experience in the dating world except with this young type who has at least  lovers before me . he told me that he wanted to consider me as his wife unless i fulfilled his criteria which obviously has to be about looks and body . i told him that these are superficial things and that in the end , looks will merely fade . i understand it can be an important factor especially if he is truly visual and i ' m sure even without me , he can get another lady if he desires to . if he had someone with whom he went out before and he is comparing me with those women , then i just do n ' t understand the idea of him being with me if he knows i ca n ' t satisfy his wishes sometimes . if i can recall , at least we clashed but manage to forgive each other until there will be another conflict...if we are already like this during dating , i do n ' t know if marriage is the best solution since it wo n ' t be the same . usually , dating is supposed to be easier , i thought . well , not in this relationship lol . i was anticipating this relationship to last long term and i know i should n ' t expect anything too much , but after going through hardships i had a chance to move on and not fall for another heartbreak . if marriage is uttered in his tongue , i believe he wants to respect me and be frank about the situation . so , i ' m not sure why he always cancels our plan if we want to have a date and talk about serious matters . oh , i do n ' t know . we  ' ll see."
istp,"as the title says . enneagram  vs  in the type . the more ive thought abut this , the more ive seen too many commonalities between the two . because of this , ive found it hard to type myself . so id like to ask all of you a few questions which is more common in your opinion ?  ( on this i will likely counter argue )  how would you distinguish between the two ? and how has your view on this changed over time?"

infp,"so i  ' ve been overweight for most of life and i  ' ve only realized the true root of my overeating , which comes from eating the food that other people would throw away to remove the burden from them having to get up and throw the food away and the burden of the earth for producing food that has gone wasted ( i come from a poor family and was taught this for all of my life )  . it  ' s taken me years to ponder this and actually digest that my gluttony comes from a place of selfnessless . ever since then , i have learned about fasting and have become comfortable with turning down food . i have also come to terms with my mortality and decided that one of my life long goals is to see my body in it  ' s peak condition before i am no longer able to maintain it and or die ( bye bye me )  . these thoughts have been pushing to have dramatic weight loss and now i ' m daydreaming about building muscle as now i have turned being fit as something that was optional into something that is important . i feel like types would be attracted to the idea of having immense power and never actually using it  ( unless it was for protecting someone else )  as well as being interested  ( both good and bad )  of the feelings that are associated with building muscle , so what do you think ? edit also , when i say bodybuilding i also mean weight lifting in general . i do n ' t necessarily mean contorting your body into a super human shape for the sake of looking good but generally toning your body to be better than it once was."

intp,"hi cognitive masters , i ' m looking for a little help organizing my cognitive functions . i  ' ll post some details , hoping you can reach a conclusion  personality tests type  type  type  type  type  type michael coz type  points type  points type  points . me self typing myself when learned about cognitive functions . me as a baby i cried everyday as a kid , always attached to my gameboy and pokmon games  ( sleep with gb in pockets ) wet the bed . just want to play videogames , watch tv , or play baseball with neighbors?i hide behind my mom when i catch somebody  ' s attention . me at school , more focused on playing baseball with friends or videogames than actual girls dating . so shy i was unable to tell the girls i liked them . i was so reserved . some crazy girls did me what they call sexual harassment they grabbed my buttocks and yelled in class how in love they were with me  ( which , of course , was more to annoy me than to flirt with me )  . me at college , as soon as class finished , i reached home . me at work , i love to annoy a small group of people , but in a childishly offensive manner . i want to annoy you a little without offending you . if i dont like you ill just treat you polite . i rebelled once again against my boss  ( i ignored him )  and told his boss i would quit when i finished my duties . his boss sent me a meeting , and i declined , stating that it was not necessary to talk . this latter boss  (  levels above me in evp level )  sent me a meeting and told me he cancelled a meeting to speak with me , so i ended up lowering my anger and accepting the meeting . i prefer my subordinates to do the talking while i keep analyzing things and procrastinate a lot . i always crack a joke in the middle of a serious or nonserious topic  ( it took me longer to be promoted , though )  . i hate politics and find it stupid when people prioritize highranking bosses over anyone else . i ' m so much requested outside work hours so i prefer to turn off my work phone than accepting the call and tell them to fuck off . i do n ' t talk that much . just burst of time . at home , i ' m the oldest brother , so i try to behave more appropriately . when out there alone , im reversed and do n ' t show my goofiness unless im around close people . me in general when people yell at me , it drains me  , and hp gets to  . loud noises and crowded places discharge me fast . people dont always know when im joking sarcastically or talking seriously . im not an organized person.i try to avoid debates or discussions because something inside me wants to say something , but after that , i want out of the discussion because i ' m a little anxious or get involved in the heat . i prefer to hear people debating . my brain skips between thoughts on different topics instead of going in sequence . ex i ' m writing a letter , but before i write the last part , i remember i need to fix a backend service for a colleague . i end up leaving the mail in draft and sending it days later . people laugh when i make a mistake . they find me funny even when i ' m not joking . my brain absorbs every problem , even the ones i need to resolve , and i blame myself for the problem . ex . mom is arguing with my brother i must fix it . i tend not to look at problems , so my mind wo n ' t hurry to fix them.i am afraid of making a mistake , and when i do it , i feel ashamed , and it bothers me a lot.i say i dont care about what others say or think about me , but i do a little . ssri makes it easier to ignore.overthinking is my best friend , and benzos doesnt like it . i have periods when i ' m social , fanciful , and impulsive . those times are usually followed by quite a bit of downtime and quiet introspection . i take things personally.i like to watch or listen to heated discussions , and sometimes i start them . i ' m not that into reading books i ' m more visual . i try to read people  ' s faces before trying to softly annoy them.people at work like to include me in interviews because im good at reading people . i hate authority and have had problems with people three levels up in the company where i work . nothing disrespectful . just when my emotions can no longer be held . i just exploded in a crazy , sarcastic way . people seem to love me more than i love myself . when i ' m at the store i prefer to spend time looking for the thing that asking for help finding it unless i ' m in a hurry . i hate to be hurried . i wont ask for help when needed , but eventually will let my pride lose so minions can work on the boring part  . exception at work because i ' m a manager . i try to do everything by myself almost always , and subordinates complaints about me doing it at work when at home and on weekends , i shut off the social button and close myself in my bubble i hate supercrowded spaces and loud noises."
