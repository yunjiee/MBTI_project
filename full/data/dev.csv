istp,dear brethren   ever since i remember i have been battling procrastination and general laziness and it is a big problem   because i can learn do anything i want but do n t really get anything done after i stop caring    which is rather quickly    it wastes time   cockblocks making and progress in general personally   this quirk of mine drives me nuts i waste so much time i could do so much   but alas objectively   i find this to be my primary flaw   everything else can be figured out and learned    which is true          so   dear <type>s   let  s hack this once and for all expand the spoiler section to see collected relevant quotes from various sources    warning long    great believers in economy of effort   which is an asset if they judge accurately how much effort is needed   and do efficiently what the situation demands if not   economy of effort can become mere laziness and little will get done click to expand we are not lazy   we just do n t think it  s worth doing past inactivity becomes a bonus in crisis situation    energy reserve   senses ready    according to the discussion here    dario nardi  s neuroscience of personality    strong se users seem to have brains that stay in a low key idling mode as the default state but spring into action rapidly when a crisis is detected so   not giving a shit is most likely how you  re wired without that   you might not have the ability to be awesome in crisis situations <type>s present a paradoxical picture they appear to be lazy    there  s no other word for it      but they are really energy conservers constant activity does not appeal   per se nor are they anti activity they simply do n t believe in getting involved in the non essential or during the non essential stage of course   they are willing to define when that is for themselves or for others but not too willing to have that defined for them click to expand coping mechanism of sorts well procrastination is a great way to deal with stuff you do n t want to do leaving it to the last minute ensures that you spend as little time on it as possible   which is ideal you do n t even feel yourself doing it because pressure and adrenaline take over click to expand this is scarily accurate   primary problem i think the <type>s  area of interest will take precedence over assigned tasks that are perceived as dull   boring   or not practical they can become so engrossed with their own projects that other obligations   if not abandoned outright or forgotten   take second place in situations that excite them   they work with great accuracy and precision   often to the amazement and envy of others they thrive on and prefer working on the edge   even putting themselves at risk   if that  s what it takes to get the job done so in a nutshell   as others have said before   there is no cure for this mindset   and you can either give up   bullshit it   or find a way to learn the material    usually making a game or a challenge of it works    so that it can somehow appear less boring useless or implement all three otherwise   when it comes to actually completing an assignment    whether i like it or not    as opposed to studying   i naturally slowly pretend i m in jail it works click to expand fear freaking out about something    crisis of sort    motivates i used to care about winning more its more about pushing scaring the shit out of myself now click to expand from another standpoint   i really ca n t be bothered to actually compete if i see somebody being obviously better than what i am in some area   i make a point of not being in on the contest   which tends to upset those of my friends who actually are competitive also   i m very much of a player versus environment person i love challenging myself   whether it  s about pressing the envelope for my tires friction against asphalt or how well i can shoot using only the iron sights   or whatever but as soon as other people join the challenge   i usually seem to lose interest click to expand talking about lance armstrong and this is the distinction between lance and i i get satisfaction out of winning or achieving a goal he gets all his satisfaction out of preventing other people from winning it  s not that i like winning   it  s more i just hate losing click to expand we work in cycles   lopsided for inactivity that  s just me in information gathering mode i can appear that way for minutes   hours   days   or even months people misinterpret as being lazy or shy   but once the iron is hot or i m confident in knowledge   i appear to be in a whirlwind or possessed it  s almost like   different people i am completely focused on that goal and once that task is complete   i become dormant again its periodic   it  s cyclic and i have been this way since i was a little kid click to expand true   but it  s not always sustained once you find an ounce of motivation to get started   that  s all you need to turn into a freight train later click to expand works the only way i am going to do my project is if there is a time line involved or dire consequences not only to me but to my team click to expand i think we consider ourselves superior in a way    admit it   things are generally easy   even if hard    it  s rather about this task is so menial   that i can do it whenever i wish   which is exactly why there is no need to do it right now click to expand after a lifetime of procrastinating i came to the conclusion that it  s largely due to an excessive confidence in my own abilities i  ve seen how quickly and efficiently i can get things done   when the pressure is on it  s like   i do n t even notice doing it because it happens so fast and i like it that way   because i hate the feeling of work click to expand again   it  s cyclical that  s an interesting point i m also very cyclical in how i go about things i came to the conclusion once   that the best way for me to shift my focus from x to y is to overdo x until i get sick of it   and then do y in order to get away from x i also find that i generally wo n t do x or y unless it  s in order to get away from z which i want to do even less click to expand i have this as well   seems to infer to be stuck in ti well   i do n t know if that  s your case   but what do feel is anguish i m really anxious even when i m in apathetic mode   the anxiety does n t go away   i always feel like i should be doing   should have done or will have to do something    physical   emotional   professional   personal   do n t matter    i ca n t get rid of it but most of the time it does not make me move   it makes me stall click to expand not sure how this helps get shit done one of the time management techniques they can be quite good at is keeping blocks of time open   always open   because if something can go wrong it will   so by keeping blocks of time open   the <type> is ready   click to expand someone please expand on this as the <type> calls upon their judging and intuitive functions they can right themselves if they get caught up in logically solving whatever crisis is present click to expand assorted thoughts when we are productive   we are very productive ok   we do great in crisis   but not everythign is a crisis   in fact very little of it is structure gets help shit done but i dislike it a lot real deadlines definitely work fakes ones    i  ll do this by  pm    nope i am somewhat more productive in life when i have something physical going on    sports   etc    the problem seems to be related to being stuck in the neverending information gathering mode   which is often offtopic to what needs to be done we easily get absorbed by games movies activities   thus enjoy ti se not making it   i am missing out   or i am likely to fail can motivate me in the short term quite powerfully seems to be a form of crisis commonly suggested fear of failure does n t mean much to me i m not really bothered by that failing is a part of learning i have tried all kinds of approaches for procrastination and so on did n t help much tried a bunch of tools   none of them stuck i find goals fairly meaningless   regardless of their  emotional  content learning to give a shit might or might not be the correct route maybe it  s about learning an internal tool process to get shit done    some leads the frenzy learning mode is fairly unique and powerful if tamed this would solve this issue but how to turn it on for things we are n t interested in    we are very effective in crisis troubleshooting mode but how to use this when it  s not crisis    how to turn on the crisis mode    apathy is the negative factor here but intelectualizing    which we still can do in apathy    does n t motivate interest seems to be the rate limiting factor of output engaging se seems critical something to sense in crisis it is clearly in overdrive   low inhibition to immediate desires           so   how do we untangle all of this    and then how do we put it together into something usable    do your thing   <type>s contribute and reap rewards 
isfj,<type> is    and male and i m    female <type> i know this forum is n t used that much anymore but insight from any personality type is okay i recently started dating an <type>   he was quite passive and at times i did n t know if he was into me i felt like i was putting in most of the effort but when i asked he said he was interested in me   he said he just was n t good at conversation but he was always there for me and was happy with me however a month or so ago we had a falling out and he wanted to end the relationship   i asked for another chance and said i  d change the things he did n t like the falling out happened because i was quite over emotional and i told him i was hurt and felt rejected because he had n t opened my message in    hours and i was worried something had happened to him anyway things went back to normal then a week ago i had a hospital stay despite being near the hospital   he did n t visit or call or text   days went by and i didnt hear anything from him i confronted him   then i lost my temper   saying i wanted a boyfriend who remembered i existed a few hours later i sent a message saying that i cared about him   but i felt there was a lot of problems we needed to overcome   and if he was willing we could do it he read the message but its been   days and no response he has never left me on read before in the past   when we would argue   he told me that he would wait a few days for me to calm down but during that time   i was always the one to reach out i do n t want to do it this time i miss him so much but i feel like i ca n t message because it was me that sent the last message and he didnt respond   i do n t want to cross a boundary if he does n t want to talk   and i dont want to force him we have very different thinking and processing styles i wonder if he will ever message me again or move on    im quite clingy and anxious but he  s very independent and dismissive usually he just moves on we have n t technically broken up   other than i said i was going to find a boyfriend that cares about me but feel like there has n t really been any closure i feel uneasy just never talking again i was hoping he  d think about things and approach me   but it does n t seem likely im just wondering if its likely he will ever get in contact again or should i just move on    i really liked him so its quite hard 
intp,i saw one of these for <type>s   and one for <type>s so i thought i  d search to see if i could find one for <type>s and here it is   here are my results for this bingo card my first bingo   how about you    
isfj,most people probably do n t think that commonly seen traits in autism spectrum disorder    asd    are very similar to those of an <type> however   the description fits me to a t especially the range of jobs    they are all ones i  ve either wanted to hold at some point in my life or have held    i am a social worker as a child and teen i dreamed of being a doctor   and have previously worked in customer service health administration as an adult i am a    year old married female who was diagnosed with asperger  s syndrome at age    while i had received various mental health diagnoses and was on medication from the age of    on   i did n t find out what was really up until i got my diagnosis here  s the irony i obtained a master of social work due to my interest in social justice and political activism i graduated in      and was unemployed severely underemployed    very part time retail    for    months the diagnosis came about as a result of a worsening mental health issues during that time part of the goal of my diagnosis was to help me find out more about what i could do as a career since social work was n t working out however if you are familiar with asd then you probably know that its defining characteristic is perceived by many to be a marked lack of empathy so i began to look for completely different types of jobs    courtroom stenographer was one i seriously considered    while feeling bad about not being able to use my credentials during that time through my fianc    it  s always a connection      i got a job as a receptionist in an agency that provides therapy to children with disabilities such as asd in the over a year since i got there   i have been able to start receiving therapy and am seeing several specialists for my medications and the health issues that followed me from that dark time of unemployment   trauma from a year and a half spent working for a horrifically abusive dentist boss and years of improperly treated mental health issues this has enabled me to be promoted to a role performing initial assessment and intake for families seeking services at our clinic i excel at it   am inspired every day   have great working relationships with colleagues and i am finally using my education this post is starting to feel self absorbed   so i will stop now please share your thoughts on <type>s and autism
intp,now   before you start   i know there  s no real  solution  to depression   but i was not going to define that in what little space i have in the title i can see already that many of you have depression just from skimming the forum i do n t frequent this corner much so instead of simply sharing stories i was hoping that you could offer me coping mechanisms   in particular maybe coping mechanisms that work for your type in particular have any of you managed to pull out of depression    how    have any of you have to cope with suicidal thoughts what do you do to fight this    
esfp,did anyone here doubt reject their type cause of negative stereotype    i have a friend who is an astrophysicist and scored <type>   i am an unsure of my type but recently scored <type> in one   i have always been super academic   have   college degrees and am in med school so i always assumed i had to be an nt like there was no other way i am unsure of my type   i have gotten different responses but <type> keeps coming up when i do questionnaires etc guys   tell me the ways you are not the stereotype       
estp,bart simpson is supposedly one and james bond   elle driver    kill bill      krusty the clown   louie depalma    taxi    vincent vega    pulp fiction    and sonny corleone is that all    who do you think are some fictional <type>s    
entj,apparently <type>s are the most compatible type for an <type> i have met a few <type> women   and yeah   we got along really well granted they were much older than me   kids   etc my question is   how and where do you find single <type> girls    in indiana   simply finding girls that are single is a daunting task let alone one that  s compatible with me it  s like girls here do n t leave the house unless they  re escorted by a man if it were n t for the trees and grass   i  d swear i m living in saudi arabia actually   i recently visited downtown chicago while i was there   i saw a lot of women just walking down the street by themselves it blew my mind   which is really sad 
infp,i m mortified two weeks ago i sent a long diatribe text to my friend turned lover    i m      she is       after being triggered by her mean comment when we last parted ways for context   we  re both women    bi    but i was the first woman she  s ever slept with she has a boyfriend    i am not one to enter into affairs    we  ve been friends for   years but only recently became intimate it was the most romantic week of my life i told her i loved her in bed   and she touched my face and said love at first sight then   she ghosted me i did n t hear from her for four months then she came back into my life and said she wanted to be friends i asked her if what we shared was real she responded simply of course it was   we met again a month ago    the first time in months    in an attempt work on our  friendship  we decided to go to a concert together at the concert   after a couple drinks   she kissed me and said she needed someone to be assertive and fight for her we held each other with our foreheads together it felt deeply longing romantic so fight for her i did just last week   we met for a glass of wine she was talking about her boyfriend and their plans to buy property together the last time we met she told me that she was n t ready to talk about what happened between us so i just had to sit there and pretend i was fine i was in agony hearing it uncomfortable pretending like everything was okay as we were parting we got into terse conversation about how she feels i m uncomfortable around her and she jumped onto a bus and left me in the street feeling angry and unheard i texted her this    i m mortified    you do know i m in berlin above all because of you right    do you have any comprehension of how much i adore you    perhaps i act forced or nervous around you because yes   you sometime make me nervous   i think you are trying to find excuses to put distance between us because you re afraid i also want you to be happy genuinely if you re happy with this dude   then i will shut my mouth and hold back my confessions of how much i love you because that s how i show love letting you be happy   even if it means being being demoted to friend but you have to know once and for all   there will never be a day that i don t love you there are so many things uncertain in this life   and that is one thing i am sure of i would give anything for you i would give my life for you i would have your kids   even it means i don t have my own   because i can t comprehend a world in which your life ends you are the love of my life and everyone can see it but you every time we part ways i long for you it s palpable it feels like a part of myself is missing and you probably haven t read any of this because you re going into dissociation mode   but   if you ve only read this last message   the point is there will never be a day you are not loved   so long as i roam this earth she ghosted me i know   it  s over the top especially because she is avoidant how embarrassing is this on a scale of         disaster      and how can i redeem myself    i should preface this with the fact that i m an <type> and major romantic i love very rarely   but when i do   it  s with everything i have edit she responded with hey i m not  disassociating but this is too much i just see you as a friend i hope we can find our way to back that friendship one day also for context about the  kids  comment before we became intimate last year   i told her i would be a surrogate for her if she ever needed me to because she cannot have kids of her own so the having kids comment was not totally left field devastated is an understatement how do i redeem myself i m in so much pain 
enfj,why am i attracted to narcissists and ignore their negative sides and still feel deep love and forgiveness for them    i had an <type>   narcissistic ex   who used to manipulate me and exploited me now   that i get those manipulation stuff and his betrayal hurts yet   he came to apologize after a month    although fake   he did n t even know what he was apologizing for and tried to gaslight me again and again when i put forward issues    my mind gets his games   yet i feel deep love and forgiveness for him   after learning about narcissistic relationships   abuse and related stuff what can i do to improve me giving heart to wrong people i m      quite young and wanna recongnise people better in order to avoid giving my everything to someone wrong and be hurt 
entp,so i was perusing a blog called mbti truths   and found a post about <type>  s being the best type interesting read   but the real diamond in the rough was this comment    warning it  s a monster read lol    here  s my take with all the dirt an <type> looks great from the outside because we make you laugh   we give you true insightful criticism   we know all about your interests   and really understand you we know logically why you feel like you do   even if you do n t we find creative why did n t i think of that solutions to not only your life problems but your computer problems too we can charm your grandparents   your parents   and your friends we can party with the extraverts   and sit in silence with the introverts we can talk trek with nerds   and baudelaire with artsy fartsies you probably did n t notice us in high school because we were in our embryonic pseudo<type> <type> morph but you got surprised when you saw us back from college break and though we looked different    aka more desirable    we seem now just oh so dreamy and exciting but all that takes a lot of energy it  s a performance we put on tailor made   on the spot   just for you eventually we get tired and the mask slips off that  s when you think we  re shallow or self centered   but the truth is   you misunderstood our performance for personal interest    and maybe we did too it  s easy to lose yourself as a method actor    but we  re just as cold and analytical ruthless as the other nts we do n t nitpick you apart like an <type>   or categorize your usefulness like an <type>   or test your mental capacity like an <type> we understand you by    subconsciously    pushing all your secret buttons for good or bad maybe you fell in love with us   but now your angry and conflicted because you do n t understand why we  re suddenly being cold and distant we  ve retreated because while we  re good at faking emotion   and logically understanding why people feel a certain way   we  re really terrible at actually handling emotion we get overpowered by it and annoyed by the illogicalness of it    besides   we  ve already found a new shiny    now you hate us but here is some consolation we have a built in nemesis and he  s a real bastard we turn that critical wide ranging eye on ourselves you ca n t see it from the outside   but were utter perfectionists in our heads and we relentlessly measure ourselves against the realistically unachievable somehow we ca n t find the same easy solutions to our problems as to everyone else  s   and we become mired in too many possibilities   haunted by how inadequate our own creative efforts seem to us we at once believe our own hype   and ruthlessly condemn ourselves we  ll may you our creations    probably something     finished    we secretly want your praise   like an   yo child we do n t accept your garlands though    unless you  re an expert we respect    because we  ve already judged ourself against perfection and came out wanting if you tell us you think it  s good   we wo n t believe you for what you mistook as bravado and arrogance   is really very wry   very sarcastic self mortification we can stagnate in our mess of ideas   with no external system of organization to help us move forward we have brief mad rushes of energy back   forward   right   left   a random walk of ideas with a net movement of zero if you  re really smart   being an <type> is a double curse because your ideas are loftier   your movements more wide ranging   your internal critic all the more perniciously accurate you stand on the shoulders of titans   glimpsing something wonderful across the jungle of possibilities   and sketch out a map but then it happens sj reality they turn off your water because you forgot to pay the bill a check bounces because you did n t know how much money you had in the account you burn dinner because you  re suddenly obsessed with typing out a manifesto on a blog you tell a friend you  ll meet him at      and show up at      you forget to call your mother on her birthday you put off simple annoyances    like depositing a check    for weeks your mighty creative intuition gets mostly employed to talk your way out of the stupid jams your procrastination landed you in people with lesser talents   pass you by and you make excuses    the internal critic says it  s because your stupid and lazy    you do n t get the promotion because while you have a lot of good ideas   you do n t follow through you  re unreliable you have no problems expressing your boredom with your job or critiquing your boss publicly in front of his superiors   not realizing the implications sj boss now really does n t like you you get a  s in some college classes and f  s in others but all your nt professors still think you  re intelligent   even the one  s giving your f  s   because they  ve fallen for your charms and excuses but people like you they think your unique   clever and entertaining   because you are they give you chances so you pick yourself up   dust yourself off from your failures   and try again maybe you get your self another brilliant <type> friend and start apple computer or write candide or invent quantum electrodynamics or host the daily show maybe tomorrow or next week but what you  ll probably do   instead of working on finishing a paper your supposed to be readying for peer review   you  ll spend an hour typing out a cathartic blog post that  s maybe more about your own insecurities than being an <type> so is <type> the best of all the types    hell yes it is    
isfj,has anyone met an <type> with avoidant attachment    i am dating an <type>   we get on well until there  s a problem and i try and discuss it for example when i was in the hospital he disappeared for   days and didnt contact me i eventually asked why he did that and he kept giving me excuses he often disappears and gives excuses when i try and discuss something he sees conflict and avoids he ca n t answer or solve an issue and just tries to end the relationship or ignore me the other thing is that he has no friends and spends all his time alone or overworking he acts very nice on the outside but always feels distant and uncaring he cuts people off as soon as they get close and prefers to rely on himself im beyond frustrated by it but i rarely see any posts about avoidant <type>s 
enfj,have you experienced this    how did you handle this    how long did it take for your to come back on the dating scene    and get really involved in a relationship       what helped you    if you are a female   you can answer as well   
intp,i thought about how these   words have different meanings but are used interchangeably in every day informal speech conversations i also wonder are you <type>s here intelligent   intellectual   sharp or crazy    here are my definitions an intelligent person is adaptable   always find solutions   and can simplify situations to quickly find a way to gain an advantage an intelligent person can adapt to modern society and capitalism and find ways to secure themselves a comfortable spot in this society an intellectual is simply someone that wants to learn everything there is   or become an expert in some field a sharp person could be neither intelligent or intellectual but they could simply be extremely perceptive when observing the world they might be really good at coming to insights about people   events and etc without necessarily needing to read mountains of data unlike the intellectual they usually do n t need books to gather knowledge they simply observe   from a detached perspective   and learn by experience a crazy person is simply someone that thinks differently than anyone else and can give an impression of extreme intelligence because they can be inventive or can find loopholes in systems easily this is someone that is completely not bound by rules and limitations of neurotypical minds   so they might come up with things no one would would think of   because most people are bound by the limitations of how their minds are programmed 
estj,hello <type>s   in this interview   i got a chance to talk to holly about what it  s like to be an <type> te ne pc s    b    fm during the interview   holly talked about her double masculine nt play and how she loves problem solving with the tribe however   because she has st blast last   and also because she has fi at the bottom   she has trouble making the final decision and usually leaves it to the tribe to make the final call holly also talked about her feminine si and feminine fi and how taking time for herself to process her feelings is a challenge this also includes setting boundaries we then discussed her double activated nf consume and how she loves reading and learning about things that helps her grow as a person holly then talked about her ixxp swing and how she never ever wants to go back to a place like that again hence why she is working diligently on her sf sleep according to holly   even though blasting is hard   she is not triggered by it because it  s still her first two functions at the end of the day   the fi at the bottom is what would trigger her with the feelings of self loathing finally   we covered her visual and tester sexual modalities with her having a good eye for aesthetics and a keen sense of smell watch this interview here 
infj,there  s this gap in discerning whether my ni idealization fits with the se reality   and oftentimes it falls apart   leading to disappointment because of the unrealistic vision of the grandeur living mostly in the head leads to such troubles   such as constant assumptions   overthinking   and hopeful idealism it  s as if the world is not my world   but rather   a dangerous place i occupy time to time the internal world   the real one   often overexaggerates the information it receives   and this could be a double edged word at the positive note   it has a highly sensitive sensor towards information   resulting in abundant surplus of value from scarce sources of information at the other   it led to a false   and at times   dangerous conclusions let  s give a couple examples   assumptions i tend to assume things   especially about other people  s action   behavior   and thought patterns according to the experiences and fuzzy intuition this can lead to negative thinking   and certain paranoia    enneagram      where perception mismatches with reality   unrealistic ideals of fantasy in order to cope   i had an inclination to rely on certain idealization those visions of idealization often misses its trajectory   because of certain empty information or wrong conclusions this led to constant disappointment with the real world   accompanied by hopeful fantasies where it  s a back and forth between hope and disappointment at times   it even manipulates objects and subjects to match with those ideals these phenomenons of mine are probably caused by mixtures of factors   such as overreliance on abstract theoretical framework   suboptimal coping mechanism   fear of taking action   and inefficient mindset requiring assistance i need your help in order for me to better evolve and adapt with the real world   especially regarding perception x reality mismatching   because no matter what i do   i always have an inclination towards hopeful idealism   abstract overprocessing   and assumptive paranoia thanks in advance 
entp,i did a lot of research lately and i  ve narrowed it down to   types i m xnxp   which means that i have ne in the first two slots could you <type> ask me some questions or have a conversation with me   so i could narrow it even further    i m currently asking about it on all   np forums 
estp,personal growth with my dual in socionics is almost like a dream after meeting such a person   i could n t take anything in my life for granted anymore i will let go of his flaws and not fuss over about it because he has the strength and abilities that i wish i had in me throughout our journey   there were of course challenges   misunderstandings   and predicaments that we experienced together he did things but i believe there was no evil intent in him at least in my eyes   he did n t his actions speak louder than the words he utters he took care of the practical things   my needs and i offer him some guidance in life despite him being almost   decades older than me when i first came to this site   i was awfully bleak   nothing to move forward in life until i had to study abroad and met this man who made an impact on me i m not sure about him though   i wish i did make an impact on him too it was rainy that morning   the streets were flooded and pedestrians were all covered in coats and they were all firmly holding their umbrellas we were both standing around the corner of the restaurant   utterly puzzled since he did n t bring an umbrella while i did i offered him to use it if he wants   but he refused because probably he did n t want me to share it with him the streets like i said were flooded i did n t trust myself since during that time i was wearing a long skirt just slightly below my ankles so not for long he held out his hand to me and without hesitation i took it we ran across the street   both held out our hands together since i trust him with all my heart it was the thrill for a long time i never felt so present i m grateful that my shoe was n t really wet   however   he is the one who is wet on that very same day   he bought an umbrella near the shops we passed by returning to my place he advised me to buy boots to which i replied there was no need for me to buy a pair of boots since i have an umbrella in the past he also tells me to buy many things which i genuinely think i do n t really need honestly anyway   i think it was one of those moments where i wish i can repeat it again 
estj,hello <type>s   in this interview   i got a chance to talk to tamara about what it  s like to be an <type> te si bp c    s    ff tamara talked about having double feminine st blast and how it comes across as fe at first   especially when she joins a new group   but people soon realize that she  s trying to te fix problems for them she also talked about how she loves the nt play and how she does it all day and problem solving with other people is something she enjoys tamara thought she was saviour consume but turns out it  s because her nf is double masculine and she can really see it as well as the fact that she is info dominant and having the most accurate information is important to her we then talked about sf blast and how tamara has trouble sleeping   and neglects processing her emotions tamara also talked about having trouble having a consistent health routine for herself we then talked about her fi love and hate and tamara was apprehensive to share them since her fi is at the bottom however   once she got started   it was easy for her to talk about her likes and dislikes this was especially true when we talked about her sexual modalities and being a tester she loves smelling different perfumes and trying different foods watch this interview here 
isfp,why do n t we have this thread    questions away   
istp,so i got thinking   again <type>s are known as the rebel types we very rarely conform to any particular norm and when we even sense that we are we immediately rebel against it we do things against others wishes we do n t care for most people in general and we generally do n t like being controlled does that mean are actions are spiteful in nature as most of our actions are in effect rebellious against the norm    can we really be detached completely from petty emotions when we take these actions    and what if we are n t aware of it    
intj,if you  re an <type> describe your appearance i  ll start i m  ft   with long brown curly hair i have hazel eyes and a nose thats kinda big crying disclaimer i m probably stupid to ask this question because your personality type and appearance do n t usually connect   but i m just curious laughing 
infj,well i recently started watching hannibal the tv series and what surprised me is that the main character is portraying a quintessential <type>   probably an <type> in it  s purest form    that being   he is too <type> for the regular <type> lol    i found it extremely interesting seeing his character   especially when he was analysed by hannibal lecter in the first encounter    who i believe to be <type>       gonna have to add two videos so you can see the whole scene    will tasteless hannibal do you have trouble with taste    will my thoughts are often not tasty hannibal nor mine no effective barriers will i build forts hannibal associations come quickly will so do forts hannibal not fond of eye contact   are you    will eyes are distracting you see too much   you don t see enough and and it s hard to focus when you re thinking   um   oh   those whites are really white   or   he must have hepatitis   or   oh   is that a burst vein    so   yeah   i try to avoid eyes whenever possible jack    jack yes    hannibal i imagine what you see and learn touches everything else in your mind your values and decency are present yet shocked at your associations   appalled at your dreams no forts in the bone arena of your skull for things you love will whose profile are you working on    whose profile is he working on    hannibal i m sorry   will observing is what we do i can t shut mine off any more than you can shut yours off will please   don t psychoanalyze me you won t like me when i m psychoanalyzed jack will will now   if you ll excuse me   i have to go give a lecture on psychoanalyzing jack maybe we shouldn t poke him like that   doctor perhaps a less   uh   direct approach hannibal what he has is pure empathy he can assume your point of view   or mine   and maybe some other points of view that scare him it s an uncomfortable gift   jack jack hum hannibal perception s a tool that s pointed on both ends this cannibal you have him getting to know i think i can help good will see his face really amazing   never seen ni as a dominant function in relation to fe   ti analysed so well

notice if you re an <type>   the best way to avoid slipping into that situation is to know the signs of an unhealthy <type> it s also important to know that experiencing one of these signs does not necessarily signal unhealthiness signs of an unhealthy <type>   extremely arrogant <type>s are smart but not arrogant because they are introverts   they usually are more reserved and fun unhealthy <type>s are different arrogant oozes through them now   everyone can be arrogant however   they take it too far for example   unhealthy <type>s might believe they are always right and look down on others these are all done openly and might make them unlikeable these are not normal traits of an <type>   unproductive unhealthy <type>s are complacent and lazy their extroverted sensing function combines with their perceiving function to create this problem thus   unhealthy <type>s are serial procrastinators in the long term   this might make them miss life changing opportunities   withdraws completely <type>s are introverts so   it s normal if they are a bit withdrawn unhealthy <type>s will take this to an extreme they might isolate themselves from society and their friends some might become paranoid   thinking everyone is out to get them their withdrawals can quickly deteriorate into other issues like depression   much more aggressive unhealthy <type>s are more aggressive while physicality is a big way they show their aggressiveness   verbal cues   and body gestures are also high on that list unhealthy <type>s might also have a temper backed by their se function   they might

way is their view of rules and norms unhealthy <type>s find ways to bend even the most sensible rules they become obsessed with independence and feel these norms are out to control them they might

and might make decisions on a whim this can lead to serious problems with their finances and career   serious communication issues unhealthy <type>s will struggle with communication for several reasons first   they become less sensitive to people s concerns and needs this also includes what they say thus   unhealthy <type>s will listen less when people talk they also have other traits   such as paranoia and anger these two traits make communication intimidating or frustrating how to get out of the <type> dark side do you believe you are an unhealthy <type>    here are some ways to avoid

you to identify triggers and work on them the mbti and enneagram are great places to start if you don t know your type yet   you should research the various mbti and enneagram types there are a lot of articles on <type>s right here on this website that s a good place to start   self care it s always a good idea to practice self care as stated earlier   unhealthiness usually develops when there s

displays the normal traits of an <type> this does not mean that a healthy <type> must be a stereotypical <type> however   the absence of extreme traits is a good sign of healthiness what do <type>s struggle with    <type>s might find it harder to look at the bigger picture this can lead to struggles in business projects they might lack the patience to follow through when there s little progress 
infj,unfortunately   as an <type>   we will always feel like outsiders it  s important to understand though   that this is because we are a minority in the population   and not because there is something wrong with us or those who struggle to connect with us but there are things we can do to help deal with this be authentic mirroring other people too much   not saying what we want to say these are defense mechanisms we fall back on because we feel so different and it  s not just in our heads we  ve seen how people respond when we are ourselves the puzzled looks   or even  you  re crazy  comments the problem is relying on doing these things actually increases our feelings of alienation it  s much better to say what your really thinking   and be your authentic self even if you get blowback for doing so this helps because being authentic helps people better understand who we really are   which gives them a better chance at connecting with us it  s also very cathartic in being ourselves we get to be who really want to be or say what we really want to say   which helps us feel less ashamed of ourselves understand people do n t necessarily think your weird   they just ca n t connect with you   like how you ca n t connect with them remember its a two way street do n t like small talk    well the other person probably does n t like talking about some obscure abstract subject    seconds after meeting for the first time they want to hear about your ni discoveries as much as you want to hear about their si past the disconnect we feel with others   they feel that with us they do n t dislike us   they just cant connect with us remember how many people like you as an <type>   it  s very likely you are almost universally liked by everyone you spend an significant amount of time with however you probably feel like you are always liked   but never loved remember that feeling is more connected to our desire for deep relationships when people around us only interact with us on a surface level   it makes us feel unworthy why do n t people want a deep connection with me    remember that these people have this type of connection with almost everyone else they are n t singling you out they dont have deep connections with dozens of people   but refuse to have a deep connection with you try not to take it personally we may want a deep connection   but the majority of people do n t also remember we do n t necessarily want a deep connection with everyone either in addition   its difficult for most people to foster a deep connection with us   because   well   they ca n t connect with us this hurts   but try your best not to let it bother you too much find that one deep connection the good news is   for most <type>s   we really just need one deep connection in our life and we  re set whether its a close friend   or a romantic partner   keep looking for someone who likes you the way you are and meets the needs you are looking for remember   it only takes one 
esfj,i started an <type> blog if anyone is interested anyway   for real such a dumb stereotype   i think this is the stereotype that has bothered me the most   because i can t see the truth in it in contrary of other stereotypes i mean   since when does extroverted feeling evil bitch          i ve seen <type> s hate threads   i ain t kidding so many people    looking at you   inxx s    tend to type the mean girls who picked up on you in school as <type> without thinking much while not considering he actual behvaior is that really <type>   or just unhealthy    it seems like emotional   whiny   annoying bitches are typed as <type> while cold   angry and basically evil bitches are typed as <type> however   i noticed that many times <type>s really aren t the mean girl quite the contrary   they might even be nerds my first example is myself   an <type> let me say this i was never bullied but as a kid   i didn t really liked anyone and i preferred to be alone i was quite socially avoidant actually as i grew up i opened up and now while i have many friends    both close and not so close    i wouldn t classify myself as popular   while more well liked probably though let me tell you this i don t like going out to parties like <type>s might do   i enjoy staying at home watching american horror story and parks and recreation i like it when friends come over   i like it when they don t i don t depend on social interaction and definitely not on being mean and making sure my reputation still has queen b written on it i have another <type> friend who s just like me   and all she does is watching law order svu and meeting mainly with her boyfriend she doesn t care for social events or status one bit but to tell you the truth on why i m not a popular girl    because my friends are the outcasts   the weirdos yep   me   an <type>   befriending the weird kids i ll tell you why other than the fact they re interesting as shit   all of my friends are pretty troubled they have deep problems   while i don t and what i do    i help <type>s generally enjoy helping others and i m an extreme mother hen to everyone around me i enjoy helping them   fixing them   and if that means giving up status   so be it but if i m not enough   let me provide you with some more examples melanie moretti from the show hot in cleveland    a show you probably don t watch but you should if you want to see some non stereotypical <type> s   as joy is definitely not a stereotypical <type> as well   but that s for another post    anyway   melanie is blatantly <type> leads with extrovert feeling   a care for the group and being kind and polite paried with introverted sensing which causes her to be detail oriented   freak out over the unknown and rely on her experience if you ve ever watched the show   you d notice she constantly references her high school experience   which wasn t very good she suffered from all kind of physical diseases   was teased about it and was the subject of gossip among her peers   and when it was time for her prom what did she do    she stayed home with her mom and played scrabbles not something you d expect from an <type>   right    but you know   bullying happens to <type>s too   not only inxx s anyone here remembers the show victorious    tori was also an <type> definitely not a mean girl probably one of the nicest girls out there creative as well   a very good example of how an <type> in real life would look like   actually on the other hand   who is the mean girl    jade   interestingly an <type> talking about <type> x <type> pairs come on   how can you say leslie can be a mean girl    i d say april   an <type>   is a lot meaner not to be a bitch to <type>s    they re honestly my best friends      but i m just making a point <type>s in general really isn t a popular mean girl stereotype more examples are mia thermopolis from princess diaries    she s had pretty much one friend during high school and was unpopular      bernadette rostenkowski from the big bang theory    was probably more of a nerd rather than popular   especially when compared to penny   an <type>      jenna from    going on       wasn t that how the movie started         and a lot more of course   there s always the regina georges and gretchen wieners s   but what type doesn t    any mbti type when unhealthy is a mean girl why is <type> any different    
estj,hey   every time i have done the mbti tests i have been labeled an <type> now   i do identify with many of their characteristics and i thought i was an <type> for a long time however   recently   i have started to doubt that i am an introvert when i was younger   i was a bit overweight and i got bullied by people i regarded as popular and important at schools and in sports teams etc it made me extremely self conscious and i feared everything from voicing my opinion to taking my shirt of at a public pool    last time i did that was maybe   years ago    even though i lost the excess weight a long time ago and i now work out   times a week   i think i still have the same mindset i study at a prominent university and i always feel like everyone else is better than me and dislike me unfortunately   i think i always value people in terms of popularity etc and if i think that they are of high value and able to hurt me and influence others to dislike me   i feel threatened and distance myself from them in order to avoid getting picked on again i also over analyze absolutely everything after having a social encounter with these people and it is driving me nuts this has led to me being very socially inactive at uni   which is pretty much the only time i socialize i have like one or two close friends and i have a very hard time taking commando socially since i presume that everyone dislikes me and wants to hurt shame me i often dream about living on a deserted island somewhere far away where i do not have to think about other people it is so energy draining to constantly overthink everything i do however   i recently attended a social event with video gamers   people i consider less judgmental and more accepting   and i found myself immediately taking charge socially even though everyone were complete strangers etc i felt like i finally got the opportunity to use my natural leading and organizing instincts i had a blast and when i got home i was so incredibly happy and filled with energy   which made me think i was actually an extrovert even though i have things in common with <type>  s   i prefer working alone etc   i really think that i need more social interactions to be happy and energized i want more friends and people to talk to but since i fear everything   i force myself to withdraw and suffer the painful feeling of regret could it be that i am actually and extrovert and that my poor self esteem and my social anxiety qualify me as an introvert on the tests    do any of you <type>  s struggle with poor self image and social anxiety    how do you fight it    how do you stop caring about what other people think of you    i hate being this self centered and judgmental also   sorry for the long blog post   i did not intend to write this much at first 
entp,okay   i do n t know very many <type> females nt women in general are something of a mystery   since there are so few of us i was talking to my one <type> female friend the other day about hormone levels   and it raised an interesting question could <type> females have higher testosterone levels than most women    i am very curious as to how brain chemistry effects personality development it seems that most of the nt women i  ve met are very confident   very sexual and sometimes very socially dominating   all of which are characteristics of high testosterone levels <type> is considered a very masculine personality type   and i personally score very high on masculinity on every test could this actually have a chemical explanation    
estp,on all the personality typing forums <type>s are always seen as the stereotypical bullies   mean jocks   or something like that why is that    obviously its not true    i think every type has mean people      but why are <type>s the ones who get that stereotype    
isfj,i met an <type> on an app i m an <type> we mostly took it in turns to initiate met up a few times and messaged everyday even if it was just a few messages then at one point he got sick   i checked in on him but gave him some space because he was sick i did n t hear from him in a few days and sent a message to ask if i  d done something wrong he responded that i had n t done anything wrong   he said i could text him whenever i wanted and that he would too    but he has n t    conversation went back to normal but it was me initiating all the time i decided to stop   its been   days and i have n t heard anything from him i do n t want to reach out again in case he found someone else and lost interest in me but is too afraid to say although he  s always been a shy overthinker   i m not sure why he suddenly stopped initiating i m really hurt to be honest the first time it happened i expressed i was hurt that he  d gone cold   he said he was just being cautious i m worried we are just never going to talk again i m left just wondering what happened and wondered if any <type>s could give me insight 
entj,hi   need advice from fellow <type> based on an situation that is crippling my confidence there is this project   in which i have submitted certain proposal to achieve the objectives of the brief however   everyone who saw the brief say that i am wrong even when i do provide my extensive rationale   they did not agree to it often when i provide explanation   people do understand and is convince   yet this time its the opposite i have also listened to others opinion with a open mind   yet their reason seems to not be able to convince me as well i truly want to agree with what the majority is telling me   yet i could n t because i am not convinced by their rationale   and i am not the type to just accept the norm or incorrect rationale and i rather do what is correct and precise also   i am not saying it out of ego   as i am truly willing to be convince and change my mind if other  s rationale is correct so i am kind of stuck in the middle   in which i am not convinced   and others are not convinced by me thus   i am now questioning my own sanity   judgement   rationale   and even my own learning and observation if they are true or not   that what i belief might be irrational   personal and subjective   because like i said   usually people are convince by my rationale   yet it seems that i am the only one convinced by my rationale and everyone disagree with me   even after i provide my extensive explanation i am just afraid that i am dealing with a blind spot that i could not see i have also self reflect and question my rationale   but it still seems that what i propose still holds true   which makes me doubt my own rationale even more   yet i could not just accept others opinion because they are false    i am judging this situation without my ego making the calls    what advice would you give in this situation   and what would fellow <type> does in a situation when they truly believe they are rationally correct without ego even after hearing the opinion of others    thank you in advance   
enfp,i have a really bad death stare   to the point where people around me give me looks that suggest they think i m doing it on purpose because i do n t like them or i m having a bad day the truth is my face just falls this way naturally and for me to smile or at the very least not have a death stare would require consistent thought as <type>s   how does this come off to you   specifically in the context of people you do n t know giving you a death stare or seeing someone with one that is n t necessarily paying attention to or focusing on you    obviously   if you know an <type> that has one and you  re friends or in a relationship with them   things are going to be different   but from the perspective of a total stranger   i  d like to know how it registers with your type 
enfj,so i  ve been snooping around many forums and there tends to be stereotypes for many of the personality types do we have stereotypes besides awesomeness    laughing 
infj,my <type> boyfriend <type> broke up with me because i exhausted him should i do no contact or should i continue to show him i care and am willing to work things out    we dated for almost   years i met him through mutual friends when he was visiting a city i was living in for a few days i knew he was interested in me but he was super shy towards me at first so i approached him we hung out a couple times alone during his visit and we instantly clicked my intuitions told me that he is someone i m compatible with his intuition told him the same thing after his trip ended   he came back in the following month and visited me a couple times even though where i lived was     km away he was so passionate and wasn t afraid to be himself around me   and i was the same towards him after   months of visiting each other and talking every day   he decided to make things official between us everything was great   we were super happy to have found each other we have similar values and goals in life   months into our relationship   i lost my job in that city and i decided to move to his city to be with him we spent every day together during that time    months into our relationship was when things started going downhill we started fighting a lot more and couldn t seem to agree on much i have a fearfully avoidant attachment style and i have a tendency to run away from my emotions i started not reciprocating the love he was showing me he would try every day to make me happy with the little things that he does   he was super patient with me when i got upset as time went on   he kept loving me the same way but i didn t always reciprocate the love to him he voiced his frustrations of not feeling appreciated and loved enough by me multiple times throughout that dark period in our relationship but i was too stuck in my head to take it seriously during this time   i was still unemployed so i eventually moved back to my home town      km away from where he lives he was supportive of my decision and came to visit me frequently we d text every day and he would tell me things that he loved about me to reassure me i wasn t reciprocating consistently   i kept pushing him away and eventually he broke up with me the break up was amicable and respectful he was honest about his feelings and what led to it he felt that he wasn t being understood because i wasn t reciprocating the love he gave me enough he told me he s exhausted from giving me so much but not receiving the same amount back he felt the relationship was unbalanced at the time of the break up   he said he still loves me very much though he said that we should keep our contact to the minimum a few days after the break up   he reached out and told me he missed me during the   i went through a deep phase of self reflection and i realized that i was the reason it happened i pushed him to that point because i was afraid of being vulnerable after coming to the realization that my walls were built up too high   i tried to reconcile things with him i drove to his city to speak with him in person and i owned up to all my mistakes and apologized for everything i did that hurt him i told him i regret having let that happen my issue is vulnerability and i will work on myself to be more vulnerable he was understanding and forgave me for my mistakes   but he said that he s too emotionally drained to continue the relationship at this time and he needed to recharge his battery at first i tried to reassure him by offering to help him do that but he said he can t right now he said that he is open to trying again in the future there are things we both need to work on for ourselves at the moment but he s not eliminating the chance of us crossing paths again he said he s open to continue talking to me but i ve seen so many break up advice that advocates for the no contact rule i m wondering what s the best course of action for me if i want him back    we both have space to work on ourselves because we are living in separate cities at the moment so the chances of us running into each other is quite low the only way for us to stay in contact would be through text messages should i stay in contact with him    and if i do   how would i go about showing him that i ve been working on myself    i would love to hear from <type>s on how you would like me to approach this if you were in his position thank you   
infp,anyone ever have something happen that you just have to share with someone    or have a random thought or idea that you feel like putting out there    or do you simply feel like rambling or ruminating    well   here  s a place to make it known if there is n t a thread for it   go for it here   anything and everything is welcome and encouraged 
intj,i could destroy you but i choose not to    someone just blatantly lied to my face and it really put me in a bad mood because they tried to gaslight me   and have no idea the arsenal of facts i m sitting on man   i wanted to unleash it all   but instead thought this is not worth my time   effort   or giving up my information sources so i just walked away shaking my head you know damn well   it  s true i m holding myself back and misery loves company hence the thread grrrr i  d say i have these moments about   times per week 
enfp,this was a big week for people to remember and honor leave a flower   a video clip   whatever you want to for people we are grateful for 
estp,this question has been posed to me do <type> have any fashion sense    my immediate response is no   but i think we possess what is needed to dress well and match colours etc i personally do n t really care much about styles or the latest fashions if my girlfriend wants to take me out shopping for clothes and dress me up all nice then sure i will oblige   but do i need to go to rw co versus sears    if it is just me shopping then sears wins happy i do look pretty good ini the fancy clothes though roud this is a famous canadian fashion designer and <type> too boot so go ahead and give me your opinion on this subject fellow <type>s   
istj,finish the sentence i think it  s a good idea to have an opposite of the you know you  re an <type> thread   because i see a lot of stereotypes that a lot of us agree with   this thread should help prove our humanity maybe it will be stickied i do n t know about you guys but i have tons of times when i doubt the fact that i m an <type>   but then i have an <type> moment and all the doubts go away i doubt i m an <type> when i look at the disaster area i call my room i have to clean it eventually   but my schedule is so tightly packed it will have to be on a sunday between   pm and midnight i start designing entire impossible worlds with their inhabitants for my writings   during college lectures class is separated into groups for group discussion and you and another person are doing all the talking because you  re the only people in the group who  ve read the materiel

estj,hi   my <type> friend is going through a very dark time disease   loss of a family member i want to support her in the way that she needs to be supported   but do n t know how as an fi dom    <type>      i shut the world out to process the overwhelm   the last thing i want is to be bugged with condolences and check ins do n t have si to tap into and offer her comfort either i suspect that   she processes her fi overwhelm very differently from me   but am completely bewildered what is a helpful way to soothe her    what words would help her feel understood and supported    she lives in a different country from me   we see each other once or twice a year 
estj,honestly surprised i have found nothing on <type> and <type> relationships on here supposedly   <type>s and <type>s are compatible types as a single guy   i m trying to find someone compatible with me <type>s also match with <type>s   but good luck trying to find a female one but truth told   i do n t know much about the <type> does anyone have experience with an <type>x<type> relationship    what is dating an <type> <type> like    where do you find <type> women       preferably single    what are <type> hobbies interests       or just your hobbies

infp,i wish women wanted to have casual sex with me according to what i  ve read   women who say they do n t want casual sex will happily forego their morals if the guy is hot enough so i guess i m just not hot enough which breaks my heart i wish women found me hot personally   if i was to go into a relationship   i would be more picky    about looks    more picky about looks    than i would be with respect to casual sex    you  re asking me to devote my whole life to this woman    so of course i want her to be smoking hot but if it  s a nsa situation   then she still has to be hot    i m still picky   i confess      but she does n t have to be a total smoking hot babe it  s not like i m gonna devote my life to her or something it  s just casual   no strings attached but according to what i  ve read   women are apparently the opposite in terms of casual sex   they just want the guy to be hot they do n t care about personality but if she  s looking for a relationship   she might be willing to date an ugly guy   as long as he makes up for it in other traits so   as they say   any guy can get a relationship but casual sex   only the really hot guys can get that i worry if i ever get a girlfriend    probably too late for that too   anyway      then maybe she does n t find me sexually physically attractive maybe she  s only with me for my  sweet and dependable nature  or whatever i do n t get her panties wet   unlike those exciting   sexy bad boys she did casual sex with in her past i merely appeal to her logic i m an apple nobody wants to eat an apple those muscular bad boys were her ice cream ice cream is tempting it makes your mouth watery it tempts your emotions the apple does not there  s nothing tempting about the apple but logically   you know the apple is better for you long term so you force yourself to like it but really   you do n t like it emotionally   it does n t satisfy you it only appeals to your cold logic because the ice cream    the exciting   sexy bad boys    treat you badly in the long term so you force yourself to buy the apple but you really do n t like it you hate it i do n t wanna be apple zoned i wanna be the ice cream to women and studies have shown that women are attracted to muscular men   with respect to short term flings but in terms of long term relationships   they do n t find the muscular men trustworthy so they do n t date them long term i wish women wanted to have casual sex with me any old fat   hairy   muscle less   jaw less guy like me can get a relationship but casual sex   that  s another story i wish women wanted to have casual sex with me that  s the only way i would feel flattered and attractive and sexually desired 
isfj,list some of your favorite movies and explain why   amelie cinematography i love the quirky yet simple plot   and the quick pace through the movie this movie is the epitome of eye sensory satisfaction   the color purple always one of my favorites   even as a young girl it  s the heart wrenching tear jerker that really shakes my emotions to the core   the jerk i tend to love simple   stupid humor    like dumb and dumber    because there is nothing to absorb at a sensory level

intp,i m a    year old college male in the u s who has been trying to do everything over the past four years to correct for my <type> shortcomings i came into college highly introverted and socially inept and have been doing all the classic <type> self help tips to be more social and driven in many ways   i  ve embraced my <type> shadow   which seems to be a lot more valued in society i joined a fraternity to improve my social skills   learn social mannerisms    my parents never really bothered to teach me american manners      and make friends   whipped my body into amazing shape   improved my dress sense and taste   and having an amazing job lined up post graduation my motivation was not to social climb or improve my career prospects   but to find genuine happiness through meaningful connections to other people however   despite having overcome the main <type> shortfalls    not leaving your room   avoiding human contact   being inconsistent   etc      i still ca n t find any lasting happiness my parents were immigrants and they could n t teach me anything about navigating american society   so i had to painfully learn it all on my own from the outside   i appear successful and on the right track   but i m despairing at this point since despite doing everything i was told to do to correct my shortcomings   i m still miserable not even volunteering for community projects nor my normal hobbies has made me happy most of my friendships feel fleeting and insubstantial   although i have a handful of close genuine friendships   and despite having hooked up in college   i ca n t find a girl to form a lasting relationship with if i try to be genuine   my <type> traits    being curious about things they do n t deem important   etc    turn them off   and if i try to act like a typical college dude   i ca n t keep the act up for long i hate the advice just be yourself so much because no one really wants you to be yourself as an <type> male it seems guess that  s just for <type> <type> <type> males it  s not like i m just chasing sorority girls either i m either too fratty for the nerdier girls or too nerdy for partier crowd i  ve been on this forum many times for advice on various issues i  ve mentioned here and i m grateful for the responses   but i ca n t seem to be happy no matter how many band aids i apply my current social circle is a mix of my fraternity friends and my nerdier friends so i do n t think changing my social circles will be fix everything i m in need of radical life advice because i ca n t do this for much longer i ca n t wait to graduate and work at a job where my ti ne is actually valued instead of dismissed any help is appreciated

enfp,i wanna say i think naruto is <type> instead of <type> which means ne dom instead of se dom i can understand people are confusing ne and se because they are looking at online random descriptions of ne and se however there are a lot of misconceptions online on the original book psychological types created by carl jung we can see the clear difference between ne and se and i will make my argument based on the original text ne and se can look alike one another   because both of them are extraverted perception functions   so they love to interact with the external world   the world around them characteristics like impulsivity or reckless can be applied to both ne and se   both of them are avid explorers   be either of sensations    se    or possibilities    ne    that  s why a lot of ne doms usually are eneagrams     which constantly seek new experiences   challenges and can have problems with impatience and impulsiveness the main difference between ne and se is that      se looks at the external objects as what it is   concretely   realistically      ne looks at the external object as what it could be   as what it could become   expectancy   potentials   possibilities that main difference between se and ne makes ne more idealistic and se more realistic by consequence and before people start to say that it is just a stereotype   let s take a look at what carl jung says in his original book psychological types extraverted sensation    no other human type can equal the extraverted sensation type in realism carl jung extraverted intuition    he actually has sensations   but he is not guided by them per se   merely using them as directing points for his distant vision carl jung the question is pretty simple is naruto a realist or he is a person that uses the world around him as directing points for his distant vision    the answer is pretty obvious if we look at this main difference between se and ne naruto is not a realist at all naruto is all about believing in possibilities why    because   naruto believes the world will become better even with all of the quintessential war of nations that constantly happen   naruto believes potential cold blooded murderers like gaara   pain   obito   etc will change their behavior and stop to act so badly   naruto believes the war will stop to happen   naruto believes sasuke will stop to be so cold and revengeful   naruto believes he will take out all the hate inside kurama as well some day i  ll come after all the hate inside you as well   naruto believes sasuke will come back to konoha   naruto even believes he will change the hyuuga clan to a better version   and finally   naruto believes he will become a hokage like   come on   to name another example when naruto was questioned by pain about how he would end the cycle of hatred   naruto  s answer was to simply ask him to believe in the fact that he  ll find a way to bring true peace to the world the history of shinobi shows that the peace they built rested on sacrifices   yet naruto believed he would achieve peace with nothing more than words naruto is overly idealistic instead of being a realist and focusing on the tangible reality where we live by the   senses that s why we love naruto   right    he does not accept the world as it is by being a realist naruto is the opposite   he believes in a world with better possibilities naruto absolutely is not a realist    se      he is a possibility minded person    ne    which turns him into that idealistic dreamer personality full of hope of a world better than it is now what could be what it is this is the core of naruto s personality and can be shown from classic to shippuden   also   carl jung already explictly wrote what se thinks about ideals related to ideas extraverted sensation    his ideal is the actual in this respect he is considerate he has no ideals related to ideas carl jung   psychological types actual existing in fact typically as contrasted with what was intended   expected   or believed oxford languages it speaks for itself how could we believe this is the dominating function for uzumaki naruto    no ideals related to ideas      also   some people can argue all of this strong idealistic nature of naruto comes from his fi aux well   the auxiliar function does not change the cognition of the dominant function it is actually the opposite   the auxiliar function serves the dominant function without making any claim to the autonomy of its own principle auxiliar function    hence the auxiliary function is possible and useful only in so far as it serves the leading function   without making any claim to the autonomy of its own principle carl jung   psychological types so the auxiliar fi should not bring the unrealistic behavior to the se dominant function   which is the most realist of all types according yo carl jung so   the auxiliar fi is not the one that makes naruto idealistic in a way that make him believe in better possibilities yes   fi has strong authentic opinions and believes in unconscious images   but they keep it for themselves in a silent and cold attitude and has no interest in influencing others regarding his beliefs   like jung said introverted feeling    they reveal a delightful repose   a sympathetic parallelism   which has no desire to affect others   either to impress   influence   or change them in any way   they neither shine nor reveal themselves since they submit the control of their lives to their subjectively orientated feeling   they are mostly silent   inaccessible   and hard to understand carl jung   psychological types on the other hand   it is the dominating ne that makes the person keeps talking about his ideals   talking about better possibilities and inspiring others in believing in a world with better possibilities it is the dominating ne that irradiates the enthusiasm around better possibilities and influence others by the enthusiasm as a consequence and this is not stereotype it actually is totally aligned with carl jung s description of extraverted intuition extraverted intuition    his capacity to inspire his fellow men with courage   or to kindle enthusiasm for something new   is unrivalled   although he may have forsworn it by the morrow the more powerful and vivid his intuition   the more is his subject fused and blended with the divined possibility he animates it he presents it in plastic shape and with convincing fire he almost embodies it it is not a mere histrionic display   but a fate carl jung   psychological types this is totally naruto when he starts to think in better possibilities like the   examples i showed above naruto s personality is grounded on this characteristic of ne there are a lot of misconceptions online regarding <type> x <type> and regarding ne x se and i want to point what carl jung himself has to say about ne and se what do you guys think    cheers

infj,come post your poetry here   all other types welcome too one of mine to get things started feigning masquerade joyous music fills the air   and fills the ears with cold despair sun and moon   side by side they chase one another   until the other hides a sun that never seems to rise   and a moon only one can recognize the glow casts shadows in the dark mountains tumble and break apart ravens crow at distant turns   of soulful clouds and glistening burns chaotic thoughts and then she turns   towards what time cannot erase   and victory that she never tastes scents trigger an image and lost times   before those mountains she had to climb sitting in shallows of mystic creeks   not knowing what life holds and seeks drifting away into hopeful fantasies constructed of bliss and serenities filling her mind with thrashing seas forgotten fortresses lurk behind in the vast recesses of mind dust covers books of wisdom and knowledge they lay on the crumbled and broken ledge glittering flakes mar her hands   the shouts   she does not understand   and runs lost through the desolate land a wounded healer of timeless might calling her out to fill with fright ful twisted lies   bring her to demise she hopes to fly among the clouds climb atop and scream from the mound   to tell the silent world she is here but nothing ever seems to hear a vision beyond feasible means   a cold recollection of bitter dreams the book of dust shakes the ground sudden light   she turns around little wolf at the moon it howls the clock strikes with a deepened scowl and shrieks rupture from the ground do not eat   do not sleep   do not even take a peek what lies behind the eyes of the blind   is too much and little for the fragile of mind among the waves crash the image up from a frozen island   dredged   an open wound that cannot mend and fibers of being that do not bend stand by   to what cannot rely on visions that fill broken eyes an image so clear   rippling with honesty a delight not captured   cannot break this calamity shadow follows behind rays of light towers over in their undecipherable might beings of whispers lurk in the night of ghostly wails   of scarring tales of what the fiendish monster hailed a speech   is what the voiceless preach all light no chains   just out of reach no shackles no warriors no boasting saints nothing that makes the strong hearted faint the silent sirens of souls   all have a taint do not try to fix the completely broken   for their fragile hearts are not open dunes of light   of ever precious insight   all of them lies   a feigning of all sight wearing masks on the abandoned stage   melodious words fill the masquerade

infp,before mbti and enneagram   i felt both frightened and enraged by te doms after these theories i understand that they have tremendous energy   almost booming out of control in their bodies all the time i cannot pretend to understand what life must feel like as a te dom nonetheless   there is a degree of compassion when i see them relieving their tremendous energy in a burst of some inane sexual joke that is not funny   amusing   or even meaningful in any remote sense it was just some excess energy that got spent like fart however   throughout my life   i have also found myself at the receiving end of these jokes i have tried to enjoy these but they are so dull always around the same idea insertion   penetration   opening and some ostentatious details attached to these so they sound less obnoxious than they are somehow   an idea of masculinity is also associated with these jokes but i do n t see how i use sufficient swear words in my daily life i am not opposed to obnoxious language it has an anti establishment sort of a purpose but i cannot forget that these very men who are pretentiously using this language are also thoroughly committed to the system so   it does not bode well with me that these    not all te doms   but the ones around me    people use this language they do n t have that depth it  s just that excessive energy that becomes so irksome sometimes i can go snobbish about it i can express my compassion in a cutting way i have to try something i venting here but if someone has some thoughts about this   you are welcome to respond that  s why this post is not on the vent thread 
estj,hello   i m coming to you regarding my mother i  ve always typed her as an <type>   but now i m starting to think <type>  w  with high fi there  s no doubt of the auxiliary si   but she seems more fi than fe   her need of pleasing others is in her roots   but that may occur because of the  w  enneagram she has te she is also going through some issues right now so   for <type>s here   maybe a  w    could a <type> act like an <type>    if you know an <type>  w  it would also be really helpful to get another point of view of that person in an outsider  s view

isfj,hello   i was wondering does it ever happen to you to check others  opinions   conclusions just to confirm your own   feel more confident    do you ever have those wait it does n t make sense is it really should n t it maybe this and look at others  comments to be more confident    validate your thoughts    a few days ago   i was watching an article comparing dogs to know which one is the strongest   i figured maybe it  s their physique as well as the strength of their bites but at the same time   i still checked the conclusion instead of just calling it a day after my theory and it can happen quite a lot to me does that happen to you    frequently    thanks in advance

isfp,hello everybody   so i recently met a guy who i m pretty sure is an <type>    the se and fi is strong with this one    we started seeing each other   months ago and getting intimate so naturally i m growing fond of him my friend is telling me to ask him where he stands on our relationship but i  ve never really had that  what are we  talk in the past it just naturally developed into a serious relationship however the difference here is that  he  s traveling the world to find himself  and told me that his plan was to spend another   months here and then he  ll go to another destination but he wants to settle down someplace after that because there is already an expiration date on our relationship i pretty much assume he  s not going for something serious but my friend    a hopeless romantic person i adore    is pushing me to ask anyways cause a lot can change in a few months and a very similar situation happened to a friend of ours she was seeing a guy casually for a few months she moved back to her country   he followed her six years ago   they  re still together some people are lucky i guess to be honest even asking if he  s seeing other people is hard he has n t asked either but i m not because when i like someone i become blind to anyone else so my question is how do i address the topic with him considering i am an emotionally constipated fi user honestly i m anxious that this was obvious for him that he  s not staying long even if he likes me he does n t want to get attached he  s not changing his plan would you assume the same thing in his position    i m getting ready for rejection but i do n t like feeling stupid just a    maybe irrelevant thought    i gathered that <type>    and some people regardless of mbti type    are not fond of texting i m not either so i do n t see this as a sign of disinterest plus   he  s busy so i told him it  s ok if he does n t feel like talking or if he forgets to answer he seemed to really appreciate that comment however i know some people in the past thought i was indifferent to them cause i did n t spam them with texts just a thought but he could be thinking that my texting pattern are an indicator that i m looking for something casual and not serious thanks in advance

enfj,hey guys   um   a week or   ago i was just learning about the different types   and i ended up on the celebrity types <type> page   which said that <type> as a type is linked to narcissistic histrionic personality disorders i thought that was kind of weird b c <type>s have such strong fe should n t they be really opposite of those disorders    so   does anyone here have npd hpd       lol what kind of question is that though    or   i do n t know   i m just curious to hear what people think about this and why there would be a link   for the record   i am asking because i grew up with a bpd mother and ended up also suffering from bpd traits    which i am finally getting help for    but   it seems like most commonly bpd people are <type>s <type>s b c of the fi 
entj,im just getting to know this guy he  s very busy during weekdays so we just exchange msgs from time to time he told me we  d talk more on the weekend but he didnt call i asked him if he really is interested and that he should make more time if he really wants to get to know me and he said yes i told him to set a schedule if that would help but he didnt do it he just kept saying sorry i thought <type>s are very intentional does this mean he  s really not interested    
isfp,i m curious as to whether anyone here has an <type> child   or for any <type>s reading this   have you an <type> parent    mother   especially    would you be kind enough to share your experiences    my mother is an <type> and i find that we are extremely different we do n t really get each other   and it really frustrates me at times everything that we think   enjoy   say   etc are profoundly different and i find that i have a difficult time enjoying her company unless we  re basing every conversation and action together on something plain   simple and everyday which is eventually too boring and one sided for me i do n t have the standard relationship with my mother that most people may have i was n t raised by her    no   my parents are n t divorced or living separately    and we have an odd acquaintance relationship which both of us feel the need to improve it  s while i m trying to build a relationship with her that all these differences and annoyances come out i realise that the cognitive functions for <type>s and <type>s are very different would that be a strong contributing factor to this    does anyone else have any similar experiences    it  s funny though   because one of my adored friends is an <type> as well i can see that we have very different values and thought processes though   so while i adore this friend of mine   i m not     comfortable around her but she  s better to be with than my mother   it seems another thing is she ca n t offer emotional support to people   i find   for she  s rather awkward about it 
enfj, cause i m an <type> and i need to know how to spot you   tongue 
esfp,i was perusing the <type> thread and noticed a lack of stickied threads   then i felt like i would help out happy i  ve only seen this in two other threads but both seemed to do fairly well   so ask an <type> a question   i shall ask one right now   stephen might you sticky this thread perchance    edit and they need a photo thread sticky   http personalitycafe com <type> forum performers        dis my face html double edit well sticky if they want it stickied do n t want to be that guy everyone that reads will know what i m talking about lol 
esfj,i have recently started dating an <type>   and we have gotten really into reading about our respective personality types interestingly   he has found countless forums by <type>s   has had enjoyed reading about others  experiences as his same type i   however   have found no forums for <type>s   i am surprised by this   given that as an <type>   i love to talk to other people   especially people with whom i have something in common and yet   no <type>s seem to be interested in the least in talking about themselves this should n t be terribly surprising   as <type>s are caregivers   and on many of the profiles i have read about how much we enjoy talking about other people perhaps we should start a forum called   what <type>s think about everyone else    that might get the conversation going in all honesty   though   i would find it very helpful to compare notes   as it were   with others like me let  s get this ball rolling   shall we    here  s a few topics of conversation interesting especially to me   how does an <type> get along with the polar opposite type   the <type>    i have found it to be a delightful match   certainly a complementary one   as long as sights are set outward and communication is open has anyone taken the enneagram test    i find many common characteristics between my <type> ness and my enneagram   ness what are other people  s enneagram types    from a faith perspective   how does your <type> type relate to your faith    in my case   christian faith   but really any faith       do you believe   as i do   that some of the best characteristics of your type are directly related to your efforts to live into the ideals of your faith    what has been your experience in friend relationships    do you find yourself to be a better or worse friend than others    how about your romantic relationships    
esfp,if you  ve ever interacted at length with other <type>s what were the main similarities and differences that you personally noticed between you    i learn best by examples   do please enlighten me crazy 
intp,thread exists in the <type> <type> sections and seems to have been a rather useful addition   kudos to thewaffle any type can ask a question   and they will be answered by the <type>s science questions work too or the other kinds of questions any kind of questions shoot   
estp,<type>s and <type>s are so different you guys are social bundles of energy   we are slothlike recluses what do you <type>s think of us <type>s    what do you like or dislike about us    
infp,heya guys   i m new here so a big hello to everyone out there   well my story is a bit complicated and i did n t know to how word the title here essentially i have a best friend who is an <type> male and i am an <type> female now i know we  re supposed to be ideal matches the thing here is that we  ve known each other for almost a decade now    we were in school together      but eventually did n t see each other for another   years or so    yeah we did n t meet at all    that did n t matter to us because we were always in touch and stayed emotionally close throughout we  ve been the closest of friends actually he was in a relationship some time ago   and honestly when he told me initially   i was kind of hurt    did n t know why    he broke up recently though then i got into a relationship more recently    with a guy who i think was most likely an <type>    and that broke    a long story there too   which i will share if it adds anything to this      but essentially i ended up with a pretty broken heart the person who knew about this and essentially heard me out and was really concerned about me was my best friend now we  ve had some history too because we liked each other in school romantically    but never did anything about it    we decided to meet finally some time ago and our first few hours were borderline awkward and normal at the same time since we had n t met since school we caught up on many things talked about our failed relationships and our time in school then something pretty strange happened we ended up kissing he initiated it but it was very mutual we just had this intense   unexpected chemistry during this romantic time   we opened up more to each other he told me he  d been hurt when i started dating   and he told me he somehow thought we  d end up together of course we shared a lot more stuff with each other too now i  ve always been very attached to him and though we  re very different personality wise   we do understand each other and really like each other we  re kind of poles apart in some ways   but we do share some things that are similar for example we grew up in pretty similar situations   so that connects us however   since we  ve both been through bad breakups   we decided not to get into a relationship it was a deliberate decision we also ended on the note that if necessary we would keep the option of getting married to each other open    he suggested that both of us are not big on marriage and stuff    what happened was extremely sudden   and since my heartbreak was recent   i wanted to be sure that i was n t just attaching myself to him it  s been some months since that meeting of ours and i realise i m falling in love with my best friend i think he knows this   but he has never been very expressive about anything we talk normally   though he usually finds it uncomfortable to open up about what he feels for me after our entire episode is this normal for an <type>    he  s absolutely caring though he does keep in touch he did tell me that he would love to relive our moments he  s kind of bad at being expressive in the digital world and he kind of switches off when i try to be romantic online he was very romantic in reality otherwise i tried being expressive but saw he  s not really comfortable with it always so i  ve stopped and i am treating him in a more normal manner the way i did when i was a friend it frustrates me that i do n t know what he feels exactly i actually do n t know what we are right now he means a hell lot to me and he  s more open with me that he  s been with anyone else if i asked him to reveal his secrets   he would i do n t want to lose him and i  ve been looking at him in a very romantic manner lately just that i have n t been saying it i do n t know what he feels so if there are any <type>s out there   could you please enlighten me about his behaviour    keeping silent   not really discussing what happened   not being expressive fully    he did say he was confused about whether this meant if we were best friends or much more now we  re trying to push each other to achieve our goals now i think i m kind of paranoid about losing him in any way should i tell him what i feel or should i not reveal my feelings too much    any advice here    i ca n t consider this a short term fling because i honestly want something meaningful with him i know he really likes me a lot   but after my breakup with the <type>   i m a bit scared of feeling too secure in these feelings not sure what to do thanks for your help   
istp,i do n t know if we had one of these already   but i want one 
esfj,hi i m an <type> girl in my   s and just had a first date with an <type> guy in his   s we met on a dating app and have been talking for almost a month now he is a very busy guy and his texting style since the first has been the same   only twice a day    mornings evenings    and if i got lucky it would be   times a day but whenever he replies   just like other <type>s   he shows kindness   care   and being supportive then he asked me to meet for a coffee we talked for about       hours before he had to go because of work and charity projects when talking he seems like carefully using his expression like he  s setting up his image i could tell because i think he actually can be more expressive   you know he offered to drive me home and at the end he told me to say hi to my family for him i know that it  s just one day since that happened but during or after the date he has n t mentioned about the probability of going to a second date i texted him after date saying i had a great time and he replied kindly without any hints about our dates or how he feels about that idk if i should just forget about it   or should i text him to ask about his intention do you think he wants this to happen    sincerely   overthinking <type>
esfp,i m trying to see if there  s any correlation   i think my sister is <type>  w 
isfj,another perc member suggested that we should have an introduction thread in the <type> forum i thought it was a great idea it seems like there are a number of <type>s who look at our forum and just lurk because they do n t feel comfortable posting being a shy   sensitive <type> type myself   i can understand what that feels like but my favorite thing about the <type> forum is that it  s such a warm   welcoming place i feel like i can post anything and feel safe so i figure this can be a formal place where some of the more frequent <type> posters can share some things about themselves   and maybe it will help give some new <type>s a starting point too so here are a few general questions for <type>s to answer do n t feel like you have to answer all of them if you do n t want to   and definitely feel free to share or add on anything else you want i just thought maybe this could be a starting point   what  s your age age range      where are you located       city   state   country   region      what  s your current occupation job career      what  s your current social situation    married relationship single   or can name family friends pets too      what  s something you  re interested in or like to do      what  s something that you really like about yourself   especially as an <type>      what  s something that you find tough about being an <type>      what  s something quirky interesting unique about you    i  ll start   here are my answers   i m a    year old male <type>   i live in north carolina in the southeastern united states   i teach high school math   i m single and gay with no pets   and i live alone i have some very close friends and family members that i love deeply   though   i like to go hiking   play video games   watch movies   watch lots of sports   play pool   gamble   and travel   more than anything   i m a super loyal person to those that i care about i feel like i  ll stick with them to the end   i over worry about things too much   especially when i have no good reason to   i still have my childhood teddy bear    he  s in my avatar    i  ve loved him since i was a kid   i still like to cuddle him   and i sleep with him every night see   not too hard   right    and if i can admit that i m a    year old man who still sleeps with his teddy bear   i know you <type>s can feel comfortable sharing anything about yourselves   
intp,i had n t found any threads on this specific issue and personality clashing   but i thought it important to discuss in case any other <type>  s had similar experiences in regards to an emotionally exploitative <type> mother father    my mother is an <type>   and i really do love her she  s funny   thoughtful   always tells me she loves me and hugs me a lot i have some really fantastic memories with my mum   sometimes we might go through periods where we genuinely delight in each others company   but in saying that   there  s a lot behind the scenes crap that she dismisses even happened it  s the personal unnecessary attacks   constant guilt trips passive aggression   always calling me a disappointing shit and a hassle   basically a human hovercraft always wanting to know what i m up to because quiet suspicious   never interested in my opinions interests   made fun of my weight in high school and put me on diets   compares me to other girls   slamming doors in my face   leaving me locked outside when i arrived home    minutes past curfew   never let me go to sleepovers or have birthday parties   etc etc i really was just this slightly overweight   nerd who did n t want any trouble another thing that amazes me is that both of my siblings are both feelers   and are n t nearly as distressed by her    if i m ever a dick to someone   i usually do n t even realize i m being a dick i m probably just being honest haha but a feeler will be a fucking dick shit to people just because they can and they know better inbetween kicking a few cats generally i m not so sensitive   as usually peoples comments are just water off a ducks back for me but this is just on a whole different plane i literally cringe every time i do the absolute slightest thing wrong because i know there  s this impending dark cloud waiting to emotionally take a dump on me she screams anytime i even eat something that i did n t know was hers haha can you tell i m not bitter    ah well if any other <type>  s relate or if any other types can offer any additional insights   that  d be cool too free therapy   god bless the internet 
esfj,i am not really thinking about any real example just wondering   because it seems that fe is a people function   but i mean by definition fe is a function that make value judgment base on external group standard   and it does n t mean that you necessarily love people   in a general sense you can also make all the decision and judgment in a fe way and still not getting involved in the social because decision making is a personal thing in this way you can totally be a quiet person keeping things to yourself an another thing is why does fe always seems like a people function    and if that is true   is it possible to have quiet <type>s <type>s   and is there a time when you do n t want to interact with people   when you do n t think about people   do n t talk about them   and just do n t    additional question   how do you feel about your ne and how do you use it    thanks   
isfp,its important to remember you are who you are for a reason you might not understand why you made your choice   but there is a proper reason which holds real value we cherish things its okay to do so even if no one else does instead focus on why you cherish that thing focus on what it means to you we make things from abstraction you do n t need to explain it you do n t owe anyone a meaning behind your abstraction but make it   forget it   throw it away or keep it and move on without letting anyone tell you why you did that this post being an exception of course growing up you may make many decisions that do n t add up or make sense they will eventually do n t forget   you are valuable you matter you ca n t get the feel goods everyday but that does n t negate your worth or impact 
intj,there  s a thread like this in the <type> forum   and i thought it would be beneficial here it might help clear up some preconceived notions and stereotypes of <type>  s while also reducing some unnecessary threads so here   any type can ask a question any <type> can answer but remember   we are people too mellow we eat   sleep   and piss like everyone else so ask away   
infj,i m an <type> and i just read this description of what the eight function does   devilish demon daimon destructive to ourselves and others   undermines   often erupts violently distorts trust in relationships   promotes chaos i m a little confused about how we use si to be destructive to ourselves the only thing i can think of is that it can be really hard to let go of the past sometimes   especially traumatic or hurtful events i guess i tend to hold on to negative things and brush off positive things that happen if i m in a bad place in my life   but is that si in a negative form
