esfp,hello <type>s   in this interview   i got a chance to talk to jonathan about what it  s like to be an <type> se te pc s    b    mf the first thing we talked about is jonathan  s belief that we should all be equal and the whole talk about race is getting in the way of bigger life problems we spent some time talking about racism   especially since we are both minorities   and experiencing it in north america jonathan talked about doing a pilgrimage to west africa where his ancestral roots were and he said he loved the feeling of blending in with everyone and people wanting to get to know him for him instead of his race he did mention one funny thing that people still knew he was american because he said when he went there   he was fat we then talked about other issues that he perceived as bigger problems such as the economy jonathan talked about his background in sports and fitness and how he would use his energy dominant goofiness to engage his clients he said he has trouble with the nt blast and does n t feel comfortable using it even if he has a degree in sports science we finished up the interview talking about him being audio and kinaesthetic watch this interview here 
intp,morning all i  ve posted similarly in the past   and though i understand the <type>s in my life a great deal more than most of the people around them   i never assume to understand you guys completely when it comes to extreme displays of emotion what does your utmost fury look like   on the rare occasion it actually rears it head    and given the option to vent your anger in any which way you could possibly imagine   what would you do    i m researching for a piece of writing   and i  d really like to get this right something i m looking portray in my writing is how introverts behave when in their own private space it  d be good for the wider world to get a bit more familiar with this and today  s line of enquiry is <type>  s when they  re pissed off to a biblical degree looking forward to hearing how mental you can get   
infj,hello the country is quite big but maybe we populate or congregate in certain cities some countries even have their own <type> club though not my city 
infj,i feel like my case is clear to be an <type> seems like to be the ultimate way to be down to earth and not dwell on senseless shores as my intuition suggests i admire <type>s to the core sweet hearted   a helping hand by nurture is in their nature i as an <type> do not seems as humble as them i have strong opinions that lead to nowhere i am daydreaming all day long stuffed with irrational fears and nowhere to go in my heart i am asking question   knowing they are pointless <type>s do not feel so lonely   because they are satisfied with little from the start our ni function is our very own doom it is an consciousness that is always aware it has become more aware of the awareness itself <type>s are more part of the world   in the world they experience the human experience in simplest of terms they take action in purer forms   while my actions are layered in semantics   in intentions   in meaning i do n t know how to explain but xsfjs are blessed they do not look behind every curtain   every leave i look at their faces and a sadness of a life i want to live overcomes me <type>s just know too much i am an alien   but they are human i just want to be normal i want to forget everything 
estj,hi   everyone   i m an <type> looking to learn more about <type>s   if you re interested please let me know
intj,hi everyone   been reading for a bit the forum and wanted to ask as the title says for some advice   i hope this is the correct place so   i  ve been with my gf for about   months for a little backstory   we met because mutual friends got to know each other at first the   of us played video games and to get to know each other   and after that i added her to discord we talked more and more each day and get to know each other   about our hobbies   what we studied and all that during our talks on discord the mbti was mentioned and she told me that she was <type> and i talked to her that i had as a result <type> <type>    i m more as a feeler but i m not sure which one i am lol    eventually we get to know more each other and started to really like her   we get on dates and be more comfortable with each other i noticed that she was very touchy   with hugs and kisses   and very open in our conversations and in person we start our relationship and everything was very good and having a good time   but one time she mentioned to me that she was thinking on returning to her city where her parents live to study a masters and even more to ask if she could work remotely due to some problems within her work i have to say she is very focused on that part professionally i showed to her my support and that i would be fine even at a long distance   we planned more of our future as a relationship even with the distance and the hopes to move together later on but as the date that she was going to fly to her city   i noticed that she was a bit more distant   i thought that it was with all the things and changes to come and did n t show any concern i was still supporting her fast forward   i noticed that she was more and more distant we talk mostly by text but mostly phone calls or anything i was mostly initiating and that was starting to get me to feel a bit anxious and insecure i talked about to her the change of it   and she responded to me that she was starting to reconnect more with friends and her family   as well her work was starting to become more busy and appreciated the concern because she understood that she can forgot to respond texts or be a bit of absent on some of her friendships for example i thanked her response and was a bit more relieved but still sometimes i m a bit frustrated that mostly i need to initiate the contact or to think that if i do n t do anything or ask or something we would n t even talk or anything it  s not just the distance but the connection that i m a bit worried one personal thing is that my previous relationship was a bit unstable like discussions and be with the emotions all over the place and with her it has been so   stable    so am i just not accustumed and everything is good    would like to ask for some advice on how to navigate or be more conscious with her   what can i do more or do less    thanks   
entj,hi <type>s and <type>s do you guys think this pair is compatible romantically    why   and why not    
estp,im stealing this topic to moxie    from <type> sub forum    link provided is jung preference exploration personality test its having     questions   but i was ready in   min   its not as that hot test offers your actualized type    who you are      prefered type    who you want to be    and attraction type    who are you attracted to    in case you are lazy to do test   questions are      if you werent <type>   which other type would you like to be         who are you attracted to    in case you arent lazy to do test      do you think that result correspond    
estj,hello <type>s   in this interview   i got a chance to discuss extroverted intuition   introverted sensing   extroverted thinking   and introverted sensing with all the types that have this function stack    <type>   <type>   <type>   and <type>    in this interview   we had natacha    <type>      annie    <type>      cinzia    <type> jumper      heather    <type>      nina    <type> jumper      and hannah    <type> jumper    share their stories and struggles in regards to the functions they are good at and the ones they have troubles with one of my favourite takeaways from this interview is how <type>s will use objects to get rid of emotions because feelings are scary <type>s will also use objects to alleviate negative emotions since they have si above fi however   because they are n t scared of people since they are a double decider   then they wo n t have problems asking for help from a therapist or friend family to help them process those feelings another interesting take away is that <type>s and <type>s have a tendency to have foreboding joy and if they are too happy   they feel like something bad is going to happen right around the corner nina for example talked about seeing hedgehogs and think they are so cute and she is overwhelmed with positive emotions however   she also starts thinking about how the cute hedgehog will die and how bad she will feel if she sees it pass away with the <type>s and <type>s   they have fi above si regardless of whether it is a demon or saviour   as a result   they feel more comfortable processing the negative emotions however   because <type>s and <type>s have fi above si   having a steady health routine    healthy eating   exercise   sleep    is the bigger struggle for <type>s   it seems that they put pressure on themselves to build up that si routine for <type>s   some will need to recruit help to hold them accountable    ne te  s    or put pressure on themselves if they have saviour consume and sleep watch this interview here

estj,where the hell is bloody amazing at socialising and also not so fragile   will shatter if someone says boo 
entj,hi peeps   fellow <type> here i need some practical advice regarding some work issues i am facing at work with my manager for me   i often can see the inefficiency in things and try to change the way of doing certain things at work to make things more efficient my manager sees it differently and prefer to do things the same way he has been doing things the thing is   i feel both of us are not wrong it is just that i am an overachiever and tend to want to do things the best i could yet my manager prefer to do things just good enough   and value efficiency over quality   as such he can complete things in just   to   days   but i am requesting for a week to complete   which he declined my proposal the thing is   the deadline is still far   and there are ample time to do things and don t understand why is he rushing me to do things his way i have even highlighted this issue with him   but the answer i got from him is by far   vague in fact   i m still unsure why he made such a decision the reason why i need a week to do things because i am an industrial designer   and i want to elevate my company product quality as much as possible   and often require time to think of innovative ways to find solutions to create great products   but because my manager just wants things good enough and value efficiency   therefore he expect me to do the same and give me the same deadline   which i can t   because like i say   i want to create really great products for the company and humankind to be honest   which require time to think again   i have tried addressing his concern and tells him i have a different agenda compare to him   and that the deadline is still far   i don t see the issue of needing to rush and prompted him to let me try my method of doing things at last   he dictated me to follow his method i am at the point i feel like resigning   as this is not once i have such communication breakdown with him and only to have him dictating me i have tried to just be a good follower and do whatever my manager says without questioning but i feel dead inside   as if my work has no purpose and i am doing just for the paycheque eventually   i decided to be clear with my agenda   which is actually beneficial to the company therefore i have many conflict yet the manager cannot find a reason to fire me   because he has to explain to my director because i didn t do anything wrong   he cannot just report to the director regarding the issues that is happening between us the reason why i feel like resigning because first i find it difficult to work with a manager that makes inefficient decision and there is nothing i can do about it and have to do work that i do not believe in the first place such torture is something i have to accept if i continue working here    i just have an realisation writing this lol    i wonder what will fellow <type> do here feel free to be direct and criticise me if there is anything i have done wrongly if you need me to explain the situation in deeper detail   feel free to ask as i intend to keep this post short thanks in advance   
infj,are there any christian <type>s here   and if so   what has been your experience    how did you end up following jesus    and what is the thing you tend to struggle with more than anything else    
istp,hi <type>s you seem so rational and non emotional you also do n t seem to react as much unless it  s one of those few things important to you it  s hard to know whether there is a sea of emotions flowing regularly through you that is unvoiced   or if what you see is really what you get    agree   disagree    thoughts    
isfj,another perc member suggested that we should have an introduction thread in the <type> forum i thought it was a great idea it seems like there are a number of <type>s who look at our forum and just lurk because they do n t feel comfortable posting being a shy   sensitive <type> type myself   i can understand what that feels like but my favorite thing about the <type> forum is that it  s such a warm   welcoming place i feel like i can post anything and feel safe so i figure this can be a formal place where some of the more frequent <type> posters can share some things about themselves   and maybe it will help give some new <type>s a starting point too so here are a few general questions for <type>s to answer do n t feel like you have to answer all of them if you do n t want to   and definitely feel free to share or add on anything else you want i just thought maybe this could be a starting point   what  s your age age range      where are you located       city   state   country   region      what  s your current occupation job career      what  s your current social situation    married relationship single   or can name family friends pets too      what  s something you  re interested in or like to do      what  s something that you really like about yourself   especially as an <type>      what  s something that you find tough about being an <type>      what  s something quirky interesting unique about you    i  ll start   here are my answers   i m a    year old male <type>   i live in north carolina in the southeastern united states   i teach high school math   i m single and gay with no pets   and i live alone i have some very close friends and family members that i love deeply   though   i like to go hiking   play video games   watch movies   watch lots of sports   play pool   gamble   and travel   more than anything   i m a super loyal person to those that i care about i feel like i  ll stick with them to the end   i over worry about things too much   especially when i have no good reason to   i still have my childhood teddy bear    he  s in my avatar    i  ve loved him since i was a kid   i still like to cuddle him   and i sleep with him every night see   not too hard   right    and if i can admit that i m a    year old man who still sleeps with his teddy bear   i know you <type>s can feel comfortable sharing anything about yourselves   
isfj,most people probably do n t think that commonly seen traits in autism spectrum disorder    asd    are very similar to those of an <type> however   the description fits me to a t especially the range of jobs    they are all ones i  ve either wanted to hold at some point in my life or have held    i am a social worker as a child and teen i dreamed of being a doctor   and have previously worked in customer service health administration as an adult i am a    year old married female who was diagnosed with asperger  s syndrome at age    while i had received various mental health diagnoses and was on medication from the age of    on   i did n t find out what was really up until i got my diagnosis here  s the irony i obtained a master of social work due to my interest in social justice and political activism i graduated in      and was unemployed severely underemployed    very part time retail    for    months the diagnosis came about as a result of a worsening mental health issues during that time part of the goal of my diagnosis was to help me find out more about what i could do as a career since social work was n t working out however if you are familiar with asd then you probably know that its defining characteristic is perceived by many to be a marked lack of empathy so i began to look for completely different types of jobs    courtroom stenographer was one i seriously considered    while feeling bad about not being able to use my credentials during that time through my fianc    it  s always a connection      i got a job as a receptionist in an agency that provides therapy to children with disabilities such as asd in the over a year since i got there   i have been able to start receiving therapy and am seeing several specialists for my medications and the health issues that followed me from that dark time of unemployment   trauma from a year and a half spent working for a horrifically abusive dentist boss and years of improperly treated mental health issues this has enabled me to be promoted to a role performing initial assessment and intake for families seeking services at our clinic i excel at it   am inspired every day   have great working relationships with colleagues and i am finally using my education this post is starting to feel self absorbed   so i will stop now please share your thoughts on <type>s and autism
istp,as the title says enneagram   vs   in the <type> the more ive thought abut this   the more ive seen too many commonalities between the two because of this   ive found it hard to type myself so id like to ask all of you a few questions which is more common in your opinion       on this i will likely counter argue    how would you distinguish between the two    and how has your view on this changed over time    
istj,hello i recently got a book from our library about analyzing handwriting   and wanted to share a description i found accurate for myself a special situation called secondary expansion is where the letters themselves are narrow but the spaces in between them are wide on the surface the writer appears to be outgoing   but inside she shrinks away from social contact yet despite her insecurity and shyness   she pushes herself to interact   at least in groups where she knows the people we call this type of person a converted introvert because while it is n t natural to her   she  s learned how to behave as an extrovert in social situations the complete idiot  s guide to handwriting analysis   second edition sheila lowe i find this extremely interesting because that description is pretty close to the way i behave in school   and matches my handwriting style almost perfectly if you do n t mind   a description of your handwriting and type would be pretty sweet to see if handwriting analysis is basically accurate thank you   
enfj,i  ve shut down karens throwing public tantrums over the years and it was satifying for me and everyone else around i m not sure if this is an <type> thing or if other types do this    
intp,post your bad jokes here jokes that you  ve heard that were bad   or jokes that you  ve told that were just bad    it  s up to you what bad means      i am working on a lengthy one now    a long story joke    but here  s a smaller one  til i get done with that one a couple is driving down a highway in texas    for those not in us aware   it is the largest state in the us   sans alaska    their car runs out of gas   but they see a large building ahead who knows    it could be a gas station they decide to take the trek together unfortunately   the walk was much longer than they expected seconds turned to minutes   minutes turned to hours   and well you get the gist finally   after several hours   they arrived the structure was so large   it looked like a small    but close    building from so far away   a large sign hung from the massive doors on the front gym  s steaks what kind of name is that    the couple thought pushing through the massive door   they are greeted and finally directed to a table the table was big enough to hold at least eight people   and it was clearly the smallest table around ironically   there were very few people in sight drinks    the waiter asked after giving them an order a simple coke and water   the waiter left   leaving two very large menus the man turned to his wife   and said i guess what they say is true   everything is bigger in texas they chuckled   and looked at the menu after a few minutes the waiter returned with massive drinks in hand he set down the two gigantic jugs   and asked   sowly   arrre y all ready fer yer ordah    smiling to themselves   they each ordered a steak and sides the only thing really available here and the waiter moved on looking around   they began to comment an incredibly large rocking chair was on a center stage the chair was at least the height of two tall men   and the width of one as well a small ladder was propped up beside it   as if people actually used the rocking chair magnificent trinkets adorned the wall yokes for oxen at least twice the normal size   black and white pictures of dogs and horses twice the size of humans    obviously photoshopped      and a few tools at least thrice their normal size after talking a while on the subject and absolute absurdness of the environment   their steaks finally arrived the waiter   holding a massive tray   lowered it for the couple to see there   sitting on the massive tray   were four massive plates two huge steaks   and two heaping piles of various sides they were so surprised   neither said a word was this customary    they thought as they stared the waiter placed the plates on the table and left a few speechless moments past   until the woman finally said i guess it is true they both began to laugh quietly after a while   the steaks began to disappear the waiter stopped by several times   and finally both had consumed quite a lot and quite a bit of their drinks   where are the restrooms    the man said   standing and holding his stomach the waiter told him   and off he went following a very long hallway   the man was amused by all of the pictures and other devices along the walls he passed several doors   each very large but without signs did he say the second to last on the right    he took a guess   and opened that door it was completely dark   but he remembered the man saying something about the light being off tile floors   so must be it he stumbled in   trying to find the light switch   but it was so dark finally   he slipped and fell into a large swimming pool panicking   he shouted do n t flush   do n t flush   oh my god   please do n t flush   as he climbed out of the pool    later he realized why it was called gym  s steaks    so ya   that  s a bad one for ya i am terrible at telling story like jokes irl   so post your bad ones    and experiences    here   
enfj,welcome   this is the definitive ask <type>s about relationship advice regarding <type>s thread here   we <type>s will do our best to listen to all your posts about potential <type>s and your relationship problems or questions you might have and answer them as best we can so just start by leaving your stories here   and give them a title    there is a little title bar when you click under go advanced in the reply section    so that we can help distinguish between new stories and old ones for other people who might need <type> relationship advice as well we  ll be looking forward to helping you guys as best we can   disclaimer thanks a bunch to dulcinea for this dulcinea said if you guys do n t mind   i  d like to mention a few disclaimers to anyone who would post a question okay first of all    and i see this mentioned a lot      are you sure this person is an <type>    i know something i  ve been seeing jawz mention a lot lately is that other types such as <type>  s   <type>s   <type>s   and   i think   <type>s get mistyped as <type>s often also   just because a person is an <type> do n t expect them to somehow have more insight into your <type> than you do if you  re in a relationship with a person   you  re going to see a lot of the aspects to that person that would motivate them in the things they do just as much as they  re jungian type or mbti a person  s mbti is limited in what it can explain about a person   and there are so many different aspects to a person than just    dimensions kc tan mentioned in his answer a couple of factors such as enneagram    a type   w   <type> might respond totally differently from a type  w  or type  w  <type>    and also culture i find the gender of a person makes a difference   sexual orientation   and also upbringing i  ve never actually seen it brought up too much in perc   but i would imagine the personalities on one  s parents might have a bearing on how a person views a relationship   particularly when dealing with a particular type also   it  s not a good idea to treat the responses to a started thread like it  s the oracle of delphi i mean   even if every <type> on the thread says i would do this   this   this and this to a particular situation   it does n t necessarily mean that  s how your <type> will respond i find it  s good to take everything stated with a grain of salt click to expand 
istj,what pisses you off    say it here we could all use a thread for some venting as for me   people who sit on the bus   and blare their music loud piss me off   i hate it   people should have more respect   i asked the young man to turn his music down   and he told me to  fuck off   i do what i want   i nearly laid him out i m shaking mad as i write this p what pisses you off    
infj,unfortunately   as an <type>   we will always feel like outsiders it  s important to understand though   that this is because we are a minority in the population   and not because there is something wrong with us or those who struggle to connect with us but there are things we can do to help deal with this be authentic mirroring other people too much   not saying what we want to say these are defense mechanisms we fall back on because we feel so different and it  s not just in our heads we  ve seen how people respond when we are ourselves the puzzled looks   or even  you  re crazy  comments the problem is relying on doing these things actually increases our feelings of alienation it  s much better to say what your really thinking   and be your authentic self even if you get blowback for doing so this helps because being authentic helps people better understand who we really are   which gives them a better chance at connecting with us it  s also very cathartic in being ourselves we get to be who really want to be or say what we really want to say   which helps us feel less ashamed of ourselves understand people do n t necessarily think your weird   they just ca n t connect with you   like how you ca n t connect with them remember its a two way street do n t like small talk    well the other person probably does n t like talking about some obscure abstract subject    seconds after meeting for the first time they want to hear about your ni discoveries as much as you want to hear about their si past the disconnect we feel with others   they feel that with us they do n t dislike us   they just cant connect with us remember how many people like you as an <type>   it  s very likely you are almost universally liked by everyone you spend an significant amount of time with however you probably feel like you are always liked   but never loved remember that feeling is more connected to our desire for deep relationships when people around us only interact with us on a surface level   it makes us feel unworthy why do n t people want a deep connection with me    remember that these people have this type of connection with almost everyone else they are n t singling you out they dont have deep connections with dozens of people   but refuse to have a deep connection with you try not to take it personally we may want a deep connection   but the majority of people do n t also remember we do n t necessarily want a deep connection with everyone either in addition   its difficult for most people to foster a deep connection with us   because   well   they ca n t connect with us this hurts   but try your best not to let it bother you too much find that one deep connection the good news is   for most <type>s   we really just need one deep connection in our life and we  re set whether its a close friend   or a romantic partner   keep looking for someone who likes you the way you are and meets the needs you are looking for remember   it only takes one 
esfp,i think i might be an <type> because i m highly impulsive and never think of the consequences of my actions   yet i m quite introverted i do n t like most people    in fact i m very selective with who i spend my time with due to being an sx dom    and i have misanthropic tendencies i have few friends it could just be my autism   but can an <type> be autistic as well

istp,hello <type>s   in this interview   i got a chance to talk to heather on what it  s like to be an <type> ti se cs b    p    fm this interview was super interesting because you rarely get a chance to talk to an officially typed <type> female they almost do n t exist   and to make this another rare interview opportunity   heather is also the super rare fm <type>   one thing i noticed was that because of gender roles   an <type> female like heather has better use of her fe than male <type>s heather also has double masculine nf blast    ni fe    making her nf quite strong she is still doing the typical <type> st report    ti se      but because it  s double feminine   it  s not as in your face as her ni fe because of her play last    se fe      she tends to lose energy rather quickly and she also disrespects sf play as a result she  s aware of how important sf is but she hates it so it  s work in progress for her to improve on it she  s also looking to doing more hiit based cardio exercise to increase her energy levels which is what she has the most issues with because she  s still an ixxp   she has people problems and has dealt with tribe hate   especially in her younger days overall   it was an insightful interview and there are definitely some differences when you see the male and female variations of the same personality type watch the interview here

esfp,hello <type>s   in this interview   i talked to tiana and jany about their similarities and differences as standard and jumper <type>s this was honestly one if not my most favourite <type> interview yet we started the interview by talking about their most significant difference where tiana    standard <type>    is self above tribe while jany    jumper <type>    is tribe above self jany had the quote of the day when she released an explosive double masculine sleep last rant between the   minute to      minute mark of the interview another great takeaway from the interview is tiana being double introverted feels like she  s letting other people down with the demon te while jany feels like she  s letting herself down with demon fi it was also interesting that what made them happy was completely opposite for jany who is a double extrovert   happiness to her is alone time being introspective or doing what she loves for tiana   it  s using her blast and being productive since she is blast last i also learned that one of the most important things when talking to <type>s is getting to their core because outside their se lead is that deep nf sleep watch this interview here 
istj,i am placing these list from susan storm s website you should not use this list in an attempt to determine your type instead the list is being placed here for discussion among <type> types or compare list with other types that you may want to compare and contrast   you use your past as a guide for the future as you go through life   you consider it your moral obligation to learn from each experience   whether it s a failure or a success you collect these experiences and recall them when a crisis hits or a solution is needed to a problem that said   if you re in an unhealthy phase of life   you might get hooked on bad habits from your past enjoying the comfort or thrill of these habits and wanting to relive them even if they have negative consequences   you remember the facts and details of past experiences well you have a gift for remembering little details and experiences from the past because of this   you quickly notice changes and shifts for example   if you walk into a room   you might be the first to notice that the furniture has been rearranged you also might notice if someone s body language differs from their typical composure and sense that something isn t right   you crave a sense of routine unpredictable situations are anathema to you   so you try to have a clear direction for your day usually you have a calendar planned out and a daily flow that helps you to know what to expect and when this sense of routine and consistency puts you at ease and gives you the freedom to think clearly   you enjoy reliving your favorite memories all types enjoy reminiscing from time to time   but you seem to have a special affinity for it you can close your eyes and recall a past memory and feel as if you are really living and breathing it the past comes to life in vivid detail and lush imagery you can even enter a state of flow through this process find out more things you enjoy in    things that excite the <type> personality type   following through on your word is a huge priority for you because being consistent and dependable is so crucial to you   people know that they can depend on you to mean what you say and do what you say you ll do letting someone down or forgetting a responsibility makes you feel intense shame and frustration   you experience d j vu a lot because your memory for details and experiences is so remarkable   you quickly make connections between what is happening now and what happened in the past small similar experiences or sights can give you a sudden   unexpected feeling of d j vu people of your type frequently mention having this sensation on a regular basis   you post process experiences to enjoy them fully when you re experiencing something new you tend to feel a little detached from it as if experiencing the full weight of the present moment would be overwhelming however   after the experience is over you often replay it in your mind enjoying the beauty of it more after the fact than during which leads to our next point   you beat yourself up over past mistakes because you re always trying to learn from your mistakes and you have a tendency to post process experiences   you have a tendency to re play embarrassing or awkward moments in your head you might lie in bed at night beating yourself up over mistakes you made    or    years ago   feeling as if the shame and frustration of it all is happening in the present   you try to have a calm   composed manner loud   brash   over reactive people tend to annoy you you respect people who can maintain a sense of composure and control   even in trials and tribulations you try to maintain an air of professionalism and coolness in any situation that presents itself    you quickly sense changes in patterns because you re so aware of details   facts   and past experiences   you quickly notice unexpected changes or shifts in behavior this makes you keenly attuned to changes in patterns or inconsistencies in people    you get a strong sense of satisfaction from crossing items off your to do list productively minded   you get a thrill from crossing items off a task list you get a surge of joy from knowing your projects are being completed and you don t have to worry about them anymore    competence is crucial to you being competent and being surrounded by competent people is vital to your well being finishing tasks on time   being logical   and responding with a cool headed manner to any crisis gives you a sense of well being and confidence this can make you a highly respected leader    check out the <type> leader to see more about this       fairness and justice are core values of yours you hate preferential treatment and believe that solid rules and regulations should be applied to all people without bias that said   you believe clarifying the rules and making sure they are just   fair   and reasonable is crucial you will fight relentlessly to tear down rules you see as oppressive or unjust    you re skeptical of overt displays of emotion when people are emotionally reactive   cloying   or effusive   you tend to get suspicious what do they want    are they emotionally okay    can you trust them    why is their eye twitching    why are they crying    why can t they calm down       you re a realist more than an idealist you have core values that you strive to uphold no matter the odds but even with that in mind   you consider yourself a realist more than a dreamer you want to know the facts and avoid having your mind clouded by theories and emotions that might cloud your ability to see the reality of a situation clearly    be prepared   is your motto you create plans and contingency plans for the future so that no matter what happens you will have a solution readily available people count on you for your ability to organize and present alternative plans when a disaster occurs that said   if a situation comes up that you re unprepared for   you tend to feel trapped and overwhelmed you need to get away to a quiet place so that you can devise a solution    you re skilled in the art of logistics you seem to innately know how to organize people and objects in the most efficient way getting things done on time   getting people where they need to be   and handling many moving pieces is something you have the capability to do with nearly unmatched skill    you have perseverance if you put your energy into something   you see no virtue in bowing out before you ve given     of your energy to it you put a tremendous amount of willpower into every action you take    when you re stressed   you see dozens of negative possibilities normally focused and grounded   when you re severely stressed you tend to flip a switch and become filled with visions of doom and gloom you see all the ways that your plans could unravel and all the potential security risks that lie ahead of you    you despise pretention people who craft elaborate phrases with superfluous words tend to get on your nerves people who try to appear like philosophers   gurus   or experts without the life experience to back it up make your skin crawl    you put facts before personal feelings you ve made it a top priority to place truth on a higher level of respect than emotions your heart or feelings might be swaying you one way   but you know the facts are pointing in another direction except in really crucial situations   you ll follow the facts over the feelings in a situation    you hate the idea of compromising your values what few people know except those closest to you is that you have a deep set of unchangeable values you know what you believe to be right and wrong and you won t compromise that for anything you strive to stay true to your sense of integrity regardless of what the crowd is doing or what is popular at the moment    change makes you anxious you prioritize a carefully crafted routine that you can count on no matter what life throws at you you crave the familiar   the quiet   and the sense of continuity that comes from having a set schedule unexpected changes make you nervous and rattled    you hate clashing sensory details being in bright   chaotic environments or being around people who are wearing clashing patterns can make you feel uneasy and queasy you like the things around you to be organized   calm   and aesthetically pleasing when the details around you clash   you have an insatiable urge to fix them this can make you seem a little obsessive and nitpicky to people who don t share your tendencies

intj,first of all   context i met her in february and it was very casual   just things like hi   how are you    kisses on a cheek   hugs and all of that but things got more real   months ago   when i begin to feel a strong connection and understandment with her we begin talking more frecuently through text   most of the time she was the first one in sending a message   asking for my hobbies   where did i live and all that stuff   making emphasis in my interest in mathematics and physics even though she is not very good at it then came something that i call the proximity paradox she begin to sit next to me at every moment   following me wherever i went and leaving me alone when i was stressed or tired   sudden physicall touches but also she stopped kissing or huging me by this moment she does it but feels weird   but i notice that she keeps giving that kind of affection with acquaintances and friends   so i do n t know during this last   months she has been very kind to me   helping me when i need it   giving compliments about my intelligence   my clothes   my personality   sometimes just being there   giving me gifts like paper planes that she made   chocolates   drawings and recently taking me pictures but this thing when she mention her ex    few times    or when she mention that was seeing a guy in february but making very clear that was just as friends or recently when she mention how she try to date an attractive guy   months ago by buying a postal   makes me thing that i m just her friend last week   in a conversation about trust she mention that most of the time she enjoys her loneliness but sometimes needs someone that understands she is very closed off about her emotions and personal things with almost everyone and do n t have someone else on that line so   generally speaking   i do n t know and lately i  ve been thinking about confessing my feelings and i would be very happy to hear all of your comments i do n t have trouble with honesty cause i think it  s better   even if it hurts 
estj,so i met this guy   months back on a dating app   he is an <type> and had recently broken up with an ex of   years considering this   we should have taken things a bit slower but he told me that he and his ex had been drifting apart for months beforehand and that he was over it   and he was pretty convincing so i decided not to worry and just go with it as i  d never had a bf before and i was glad i did because i had never been happier than i was when we started dating we like all the same stuff   music   films   tv shows and have a very similar sense of humour and it felt like we were made for one another even though we are very different people   it felt like we got each other and for me   it was perfect and he told me he felt the same way i mean this guy does n t seem like the type to express his feelings but he would tell me every day how he was so glad he found me and that he had never loved anyone this much before a couple months back he even opened up to me about his dad  s death    which is unusual for him    and cried in front of me    also unusual    it brought us even closer and he continued to make me feel secure and happy in our relationship until one day   i got a message saying he thinks we should take a break   that he had n t been feeling the same way lately and he needed space to figure out what he wants i was confused because he had n t been acting any different and he was the one asking me about going on holiday together only the week beforehand but i agreed to give him space he still insisted on texting all the time during this  break  and still flirted with me   it did n t make any sense so i suggested we stop texting for awhile so he could think and hopefully make his mind up faster the next day he broke up with me and said he just was n t ready for a relationship and he could n t ask me to wait but from recent posts on his social media   it  s pretty obvious he wants his ex back i posted his here because i was curious if any <type>  s might be able to understand his mind and how he changed it so quickly    as an <type>   i find it difficult to understand how someone could be genuinely as in love as he made me believe he was   and then want nothing to do with me the next week is it pointless for me to hold out hope for him changing his mind back again    
entj,just wondering cause all rationals people are suppose to be so call smart   
entp,just like the <type> thread   how do you look as a <type>    post picture of your <type> self and lets see if any patterns emerge or just be a narcissist and whore it up 
esfp,hello <type>s   in this interview   i got a chance to talk to jaxson about what it  s like to be an <type> se fi cp b    s    mf first   jaxson started the interview by talking about his uncontrollable consume and gathering it  s so bad that when he gets what he wants   he has trouble appreciating it and wants to get the next bigger and better thing recently   he  s been working hard at buying a home and he  s getting a sense of deep appreciation for the work it took to be able to get one he came to realize that the journey to get something can sometimes be more rewarding than having the thing itself jaxson also talked about his fear of the abstract and talked about believing in vampires and werewolves he also talked about fearing the nefarious ni plan where someone can trap him somewhere he talked about watching a movie about a cult that traps people only to hack them up and he  s truly scared that these kinds of things do exist in real life jaxson said he is going to work on his nf sleep last moving forward watch this interview here 
isfp,i m an <type> girl and recently i have a crush on an <type> boy we are in the same class and to me   we act like bf and gf   only we never proposed i only got close to him since the start of      we spent almost every recess and lunch together   and we enjoy each others  presence he comes to my seat pretty often in the mornings before classes start    he used to start sleeping from the instance he gets to his seat    and i go to him every recess at first   we just seemed like normal school friends   chatting and making fun of each other   but somehow i grew to stick with him and making physical touches like touching his hair or his face at first   he stared at me and told me not to do it but now   i can touch him everytime i want also   he seems to be flirting with me as he never stays half as close with any other girls he even kneeled down by my side and put his head on my desk once       and he helped me cool down once in a school outing by putting his iced coffee on my face    obviously not to shock me but to help me cool down    and when i lent him his fan   he adjusted the angle by moving my hand directly when he refused to stand and continued walking   i gave him my hand and he took it and got up also   we stuck together throughout the day and even when i moved to the front   he followed i m not very good at reading people  s mind but i guess he at least has some interest or feelings for me    i proposed to him but got rejected as he said he could n t get into an intimate relationship right now   but we still stick together every day after this can i believe that he likes me as well    and should i wait for him to reciprocate    many thanks 
enfp, what are some questions you  d like to ask <type>s    any questions   from random to intellectual or completely offensive   welcome   d
infj,it will be a bit long again the default of the professionalized betrayal   from one to one   it was never believed really for what it was   places members of the lost upper middle class into the hands of autonomous physical welfare of what then was never for sure their problem to govern    it just is n t    they confuse hobbying and leveling the high ground   when generally close to exceptional individuals in their symbolic attributes coming from lower middle class environments which grew into a truer period of depopularization of academic benches all came to them as better inquisitive ground for better employment of their life force to be able to learn by living through the societal judgements towards the specifying of love relationships for example   or worklife   ancestral entrepreneurship   group law making   blunt stochastization of income and outcome poverty   to oppose with the greatest care to   well   what could simply be less inclined to make such people in turn what these people learnt from   primarily   by the default itself of its requirement   was themselves first   and the rest followed whatever which is now physicalize in the very practice of their academically learnt decisions   en coulisse arguments   negatiotated pre delegations   professional forcings   amiable compromises and given returns   indeed   was rightfully to never be physical environments are by themselves obligatorily aculturally driven they are there to serve the mental welfare in the cultural sense   outside of reaching systems of what jean jacques rousseau called obligation to oppose to necessity imaginary against felicitative as to what is a society of men coming from the separated conjunction of these two categories they are really what is the closer to culture is deemed to be by the people themselves   that of which the desacralized actual upper middle class opposes its notion of diversity through moving themselves outside of more popular cultural learnings   preaches and functions through boredom in the sole hope of regaining the upper hand over whatever permitted the arising of these good misses and gentlemen   come to invest more and more the trust towards acultural methods of popular   strictly mental i dare say   more worldly   felicitative mode of being under that notion they in all   refuse obligation   that on which they cut short by specializing themselves in newly sought positions of leadership for roles which do n t need them   they preach more and more the trend of usable insanity to react to any pushes for unstable   so called deviant mentality in fact more really a search for cultural abundance   that which almost never answers so well for whomever in turn would respond better in the here to of precedent work she misses one category then lands there   which in his own right   is wholefully physical   trully    revocably    organized culturally   and an other is sadly more atuned to work at their expense at an acultural rythm as an organism of results of which   well   the first would in turn answer much more well and freely so from an unrevendicated pro social autist    little clarifying note of the aspect these organisms would be the same or they would be not    
entj,if there  s one personality type that i  ll never understand unless i ask someone who has the type personally about how they act and what their thought processes looked like   it  s you guys   the <type>s i do n t understand why i can grasp every single type that does n t have ni as their dominant or auxiliary function   especially auxiliaries   probably due to a lack of ni based knowledge because i know so little about you guys   i can only really use stereotypes and blanket statements as of now stereotypes such as cruelly and coldly efficient plan makers   but that does n t fit right with me no matter how much i try and convince myself so   basically   what makes an <type> tick    what do you strive for    how are you like around others    what  s your take on your extraversion    how does an inferior fi work with you guys    tertiary se    what  s something you look most forward to in life       do n t answer all of these   i got a little sidetracked and just kept coming up with questions to ask      thanks

infj,if we get enough votes   i was hoping to get this thread stickied so <type>s can use it as a medium to vent and have quick access to it   instead of making individual threads anyways   if you  re having a bad day or just want to yell to the four winds issues that have been frustrating you lately   this is the thread to do so of course   if you have specific issues that you would like our wise members of this board to help you out with   you  re welcome to make your own thread for it begin 
esfj,i have n t seen any on here and i m pretty curious about them do they just never go online    
istj,have you <type>s ever noticed that the aspects of your personality type that appear in memes are the same as in <type> memes    how can this be possible if the two types are opposites    
enfj,i have    better said had    an <type> t girlfriend   which now hates or does n t like me because i told her that i have gender dysphoria and do you know how to i can make her to continue the relationship    if it  s possible    or at least how to make her to forgive me    if that  s also possible       i think it hurt her it is my first relationship and since this information would n t hurt me much    actually   not at all    if she told me that   so i thought it would n t hurt her too much    this is the first time i m writing a post here so could you please also tell me how i should make them better       
entp,have a read of this website discussion on whether <type>  s actually have introverted tendancies   personalitydoor com the introverted <type>s i suspect this interpretation reflects the four temperaments rather than the sixteen types    or perhaps a slight variation to the temperaments    np nj st sf i can see how np can reflect some introverted tendancies in the <type> for example    also   does this concept work for other types    can an <type> exhibit extraverted tendancies    opinions    
entp,i m <type> the <type>s i  ve encountered seem very exuberant   but after knowing them    only a couple of women    i get the feeling they are less willing to be in contact with their emotions is this understanding correct    it seems confusing to me because i would associate their exuberance with emotions 
intj,<type>s whats your current short term goals   hobbies what things do you want to master or become good at    
infp,do you sometimes feel like you are being interrogated and that you  re personal space has been intruded on when someone asks you a normal   harmless question or comment    for example   in college   i had a friend who would always point something out about me if i got a new pair of shoes   she would say oh you got a new pair of shoes and then tell me her opinion of them well   i m sure to a lot of people this would just seem normal but for some reason   i felt like i was being interrogated and that my personal space was being invaded i do n t know why i felt that way it might have something to do with the fact that i do n t usually make casual remarks like that about other people and thier appearance of whatever the case may be i guess i feel like it  s none of my business so for example   if someone i know gets a new hairstyle   i most likely wo n t make a comment about it   whether i feel like the hairstyle looks nice or not i usually just keep my opinion to myself 
istp,recently   i  ve had a lot of shit i  ve wanted to say here   but none of it really warrants it  s very own thread so think of this as a  <type>s spouting random bull  thread   say one   say twenty all types are welcome ahem      when i was younger    and still quite a bit now    i would deal with my constant sense of loneliness by escaping to my own fantasy world   most things were the same but whatever need i had was filled in some weird   analogous way i still do n t know if that  s me channeling my inner <type>  s ne or if it  s because i m one sandwich short of a picnic      i find replying to facebook events almost impossible i do n t know there  s something constricting about committing to something in a way in which other people can see eurgh      sometimes i think my only friend in the world is my pet bird at least   he  s the only thing which is reliably happy to see me animals people period      i envy some other <type>s ability to tell people what they really think of them i guess i also envy most other <type>s that have better se than me      my favorite time of day is the night   namely when everyone else has gone to bed and i m still awake i love the silence   it really helps me to focus i also like scuba diving for much the same reason      sometimes i wonder if i m missing a point by not really bothering with finding someone to be in a relationship with idk   i just look at people in relationships and wonder if feigning interest in someone i know i would n t have any long term potential with in exchange for intimate companionship is worth it i wonder until i realize that in order to find someone to be in a relationship with that would mean having to get up and talk to people back to screwing around on personality forums making asinine threads then 
enfj,hey all   i was wondering if any <type> guys are sexually submissive it seems like most <type> men are naturally inclined towards taking care of their partners   and that usually manifests as dominance in the bedroom but i want to know if it s the opposite for any of y all

enfp,how would you feel if your close childhood friend contact you out of nowhere    let s say your best friend or someone you re extremely close with from high school middle school moved away to a different state    you haven t seen spoken to them in years    asked if you want to catch up   how would you feel    curious sent from my iphone using tapatalk
infp,ive possibly made a fecking lot over the years   yet i sometimes wonder weather there is such thing as a poor decision like do they teach us something more valueable and even   was there really any other choice to be made   as in your decision was allready made for you   like some pre determined fate in truth i havnt come to any conclusion   so was wondering if any of you have some poor decisions regrets you care to share do you think they may have shaped your life in a more negative way   are they something you live to regret   or can you see a positive side to it   in the latter years i guess i will start when i was      a friend and i   had a small home made tatoo each by some other kids at school we knew   trying to be cool it was no big deal   just a small cross at the top of my forearm no bigger than maybe an inch the following summer during break i got a saturday job with a friend of my dads   who was a tatooist   being into art   i loved it   i was just tracing out the tatoos for the customers and talking to them   it was a fun and vibrant atmosfear by the end of the summer   the tatooist asked if i wanted a tatoo   and being young and stupid i thought it would be cool as feck   i asked my parents   my mum was rightly dead against it   but my dad said the choice was mine so i went for it   a tattoo at the top of my forearm covering the cross it wasnt something i really thought about   just picked something i thought might be cool anyways im left was a four inch tatoo on my arm that looks like shite for someone who is very self conscious   possibly brought on by another bad decision its been a pane in my life   though now im much older i give less of a shit on the bright side   im ginger   and ye olde firey sod aint my biggest fan   so it dont get an airing that much still i havnt had one since 
estp,i took the animal personality test twice and got rhino and tiger are those common to being <type>    
estp,i have realized there is no thread for this on the <type> forum and am curious to see what everybody says
infp,hello all   recently i started a new youtube channel called <type> reflections in it we discuss many topics that would be of interest to an <type> please subscribe and share your own world view with us <type> reflections
istp,as i have said before   people wanting to know more about how cognitive functions work   will benefit from going to practical typing ryan    confirmed <type>    and mara    confirmed <type> type    put a lot of analysis into their articles eliminating the bias from other systems of thought recently mara gave her thoughts on how ixtp types use extraverted feeling here is what she had to say   inferior fe users are anti marketing for <type>s and <type>s   the pure logic or legitimacy of the idea should reign supreme these types are willing to pursue any idea or thought that might be true   regardless of the implications however   once they discover what they deem to be true   they don t want to have to dumb it down for you    bear in mind   i m not saying these types are inherently smart i m speaking from their perspective    practically speaking   this means that an ixtp that produces a novel idea will innately struggle that idea of marketing that idea to others   beyond relaying or demonstrating the pure rationale of the idea stereotypically   this is why you see the genius inventor always teaming up with a business partner the inventor usually lacks the business sense   and needs the partner   yet often struggles with the tactics utilized by the business partner in an ixtp s ideal world   all they should have to do is explain what they produced or thought of   and people should automatically get it and see it s value if the idea or product is good   it should thrive without any social effort   inferior fe users dismiss the value of connections high extraverted judgers    fjs or tjs    typically recognizes the value in utilizing the system to their advantage this often includes the people in it remember the saying   it s not what you know it s who you know    <type>s and <type>s by default want to rise through the ranks purely on their own skill   knowledge or merit they don t want to have to cater to others   make themselves likeable   etc that s not to say they won t want friends or won t be personable   but in their minds   none of that should matter in a professional sense or be rooted in a long term success strategy these types have a strong independent streak social connections are not something they ll want to go out of their way to form   inferior fe users may dismiss the value of credentials sometimes official education    which typically results in credentials of some kind    is necessary to learn a trade or profession other times   one can learn a skill without going through any official program however   many people value credentials they like to see it as proof of the person s expertise or legitimacy so   in many cases   it s valuable to collect credentials to bolster your personal marketability this is a concept that <type>s and <type>s may innately struggle with after all   like i mentioned in the previous point   they believe their skill knowledge should speak for itself the concept of gaining credentials for the sake of currying favor or earning legitimacy will frustrate them and feel like a frivolous waste of time   inferior fe users can fail to infuse emotional value into their work inferior feelers are often disconnected from their own emotions and emotions in general to some degree as a result   many inferior feelers struggle to connect with people in a deep   meaningful   or intimate way however   another aspect of the feeling function is it s focus on emotional value people like to relate the feeling functions    and thus   feelers    to values   but technically every individual has values    feeling vs thinking what are values       the feeling functions specifically deal with the personal   emotional   and social implications of values so   getting back to inferior fe   the struggle that an <type> or <type> may have is infusing value into their work in such a way that other people will find it valuable or relatable   inferior fe users have anxiety concerning social protocol   not social anxiety in general ok   here s where i ve often gotten inferior fe wrong many people suffer from social anxiety an ixtp s anxiety is more specific than that an ixtp who is starting to develop their inferior fe   or at the very least   has not suppressed it   will simultaneously feel aware of   yet blind to   social protocol in other words   they know it s there   and that it should be adhered to   but they don t know how to do that if the ixtp doesn t care to make any kind of impact or find their role in society   then this awareness may not matter to them they ll avoid scenarios that are too cumbersome   and make friends that don t emotionally or socially pressure them    people   generally speaking   may not actually be a source of stress    however   the anxiety will kick in when their inferior fe begins developing enough to give them a desire to make a social impact or find where they belong in the quote above   carl jung said   he is none the less beset by the greatest anxiety if ever he has to make it an objective reality this anxiety is specific to when ti dominants want to take their ideas knowledge and implement them within reality    in other words   contribute to society    they re aware of their struggle to make a social impact and emotionally connect with others   but feel compelled on some level to share their ideas or abilities with the world in that area   they feel inferior   and fear rejection or failure because of this inadequacy    yet   the very idea that they could be successful if they simply found a way to adapt whatever they re capable of contributing stirs up some level of disdain within themselves because their work in it s purest form should be good enough    click to expand i omitted some personal experiences mara shares in the article if you want see what she has to say   you can read the article in its entirety here besides after reading the article   like me i think you will be able to conjure up your own experiences from inferior use of fe enjoy   
isfj,i am an <type> p i feel incredibly alone and vulnerable   but no one notices   no one reaches out to hold my heart   and i will likely always be this way   simply because i am not sure i will ever be able to trust anyone at that depth of my heart ever again   even though that  s what i need at the core of who i am god created me for others   but the one that i chose apparently got the memo and chose to betray me at the core of who i am and then poke fun and make light of how i felt   incredulous that anyone could feel like that i am just sick of false advertisement and i am not sure i will ever find someone outside of this relationship when or if it ever ends   because unlike others   i take vows seriously
entj,hi all   recently i  ve let down an <type> that i value very much some factors combined let to me being much less efficient in meeting our common goal   which clearly led to this <type> being frustrated now i want to apologize i mean   i  ve already done so   but it feels like it did n t really work   as they kinda retreated inwards or something so   i would really love to get some help and advice how to apologize to an <type> properly    thanks in advance   
istj,i as an <type> would like to know what you all think of every typological type i encourage you to be as specific as you wish    using type combos or other particularalities   etc    
infp,when is the last time you felt like you were enough as you were    that you weren t fundamentally lacking something    why did you think that situation or moment made you feel that    
isfj,i met an <type> on an app i m an <type> we mostly took it in turns to initiate met up a few times and messaged everyday even if it was just a few messages then at one point he got sick   i checked in on him but gave him some space because he was sick i did n t hear from him in a few days and sent a message to ask if i  d done something wrong he responded that i had n t done anything wrong   he said i could text him whenever i wanted and that he would too    but he has n t    conversation went back to normal but it was me initiating all the time i decided to stop   its been   days and i have n t heard anything from him i do n t want to reach out again in case he found someone else and lost interest in me but is too afraid to say although he  s always been a shy overthinker   i m not sure why he suddenly stopped initiating i m really hurt to be honest the first time it happened i expressed i was hurt that he  d gone cold   he said he was just being cautious i m worried we are just never going to talk again i m left just wondering what happened and wondered if any <type>s could give me insight 
infp,hello   i am an <type> woman i met an <type> a few weeks ago and it  s been the most surreal encounter i  ve ever had so many things needed to be aligned for us to meet and i just felt this huge attraction for him i like to compare it to the before sunrise movie    and knowing they are both our mbtis   it makes even more sense    i was traveling to another country   i was supposed to meet with friends for dinner this <type> is also from abroad and he was meeting a friend of a friend that i was supposed to have dinner with so we ended up having all dinner and drinks together he did n t specifically look at me or interact with me even though he seemed to interact with everyone else we are both taken so i did n t think much more than that    now looking back and reading about <type>s it makes total sense because he did tell me after   that he thought i was cute when he first saw me so i guess he acted this way on purpose    the night passes by and we end up in the kitchen talking i start to feel a vibe but i just think he is a bit tipsy he started to share with me his deepest thoughts even though we just met at this point   i m thinking he is cute and had the sweetest worries   i could tell he cared a lot about his family and people around him and i liked that a lot about him the conversation went on i just really liked what we were talking about from religion to my relationship issues with my bf   i felt such a strong connection and i liked that he was so emotionally developed and empathetic   i  ve never met a guy like this i could sense he was attracted to me because he became touchy and i just felt so attracted to him too i never felt so emotionally connected with someone i just met by the end   we were just the last ones left   everyone left or went to sleep the tension was real he started softly by telling me that he was happy we met and how close he felt to me even though we just met but he ended up telling me how attracted he was to me and after that   it  s just like he had no filter   and he would just go on about his feelings towards me i was so taken aback at how transparent he was about how he felt and i felt the same about him even though i think we both really wanted to act on it   we decided to leave it like this and not do anything because we were both taken during this whole time   he was just very respectful we slept one hour   had coffee together at a coffee shop in the morning while waiting for the others to wake up i was wondering if i would still feel as attracted to him but i did   i think he did too because he seemed so nervous during the coffee and he would continue asking me tons of deep questions about life i knew i was leaving the country soon so that was going to be the only time we would see each other when i left   he felt distant and i guessed it was because his friend was there and that was the one and only time i saw him later on   i initiated a conversation with him on instagram but after a few days   he told me in the nicest way possible that out of respect he will stop talking to me   that he needs to go back   settle and think about it he said he  s good in his relationship but maybe sometimes connection happens and we ca n t help it i really understand how hard our situation is and i also need to process it on my side and decide what i want to do with my relationship a few days later   he unfollowed me i saw him look at my stories once after that but not since i later tried to guess his mbti from the conversation we had and i think he  s an <type> it makes even more sense knowing that it  s supposed to be one of the best mbti matches for an <type> so my question is what goes into the mind of an <type> in this kind of situation where you are taken but attracted to someone else    thanks a lot for making it to the end of my story   
estj,<type> maybe best type compatible with me in a relationship and i did not meet them so how can i recognize them through conversation and asking questions and answer they will be organized and focus on present but how to spot them
esfp,hello <type>s   in this interview   i got a chance to talk to andreas about what it  s like to be an <type> se fi cs p    b    ff we started the interview talking about his ni and how hard planning is for him then   we discussed the issue with being blast last and being consume and sleep saviour and how often times   he just ca n t be bothered to do something committing to plans becomes a challenge this specific type because of the indecisiveness of being cs and blast last the only time andreas said he can commit quickly if it  s something he really wants to consume badly like a good movie or food or shopping however   when it comes to hanging out with people   it gets put in the maybe but not sure category until closer to the date andreas said he  s always waiting to see if something better comes up we also talked about productivity and i asked him if he often times feels like he could be more productive andreas revealed that he thinks about it a lot but still ca n t get himself to get started on doing the productive thing he said he  s been trying to get things done before the deadline recently and he  s starting small like with his car repairs watch this interview here 
enfj,hey <type>s   i already made such posts before but never on a inferior ti type forum so let  s go   do you like to check others  opinion   conclusions to be more confident   to confirm your own    do you ever think this is stupid   illogical blablabla    anything   really    and like to see others  take on it    thanks in advance   
isfj,hi there   everyone i m billy and i m an <type> with adhd i was wanting to know if there are any other <type>s with adhd    any comments would be very helpful happy 
enfp,what questions would you like to ask your future self if you were to meet them    if you don t want to ask them any questions   would you be interested in conversing with them at all    why or why not    sent from my iphone using tapatalk
istp,so i got to thinking that there are a lot of superficial similarities i find that when i casually try to type someone in my head   i have a difficult time with telling the difference although the differences are significant   do you think it  s possible for <type>s and <type>s to mistype themselves    if so   why    
infp,it  s a bit shocking to me how rapidly and meaningfully public discourse has changed in the past couple of years regarding unidentified objects in the sky with the revelation of programs like aatip in the u s and military sensor data being released into the public while it  s still unclear what we  re seeing in the sky it has become increasingly clear that there is something actually being seen   it  s no longer hillbillies and stories now it  s military officers and civilian pilots with recordings on advanced sensor systems we  ve even seen the former head of the israeli space agency come forward with some albeit fantastical tales   but i m stumped as to what would motivate him to lie about this why would someone who spent decades as a decorated military officer and subsequent architect and leader of their nations space program burn their legacy to the ground    though i  ll acknowledge that his assertions are really hard to accept now we even have mainstream news treating the subject with some degree of seriousness for the first time since the sixties this was released just today i think i have no idea what the ship recorded   but it was n t swamp gas or a weather balloon   and if it is a drone who is making drones with technology decades or more in advance of the best the world has to offer    what are we seeing    and why has a government who has spent decades stifling an issue now reversed course entirely    thoughts    
enfp,this was a big week for people to remember and honor leave a flower   a video clip   whatever you want to for people we are grateful for 
istp,so i got thinking   again <type>s are known as the rebel types we very rarely conform to any particular norm and when we even sense that we are we immediately rebel against it we do things against others wishes we do n t care for most people in general and we generally do n t like being controlled does that mean are actions are spiteful in nature as most of our actions are in effect rebellious against the norm    can we really be detached completely from petty emotions when we take these actions    and what if we are n t aware of it    
infp,so i  ve noticed that as <type>s we tend to be a bit negative   and especially put ourselves down so i  ve decided to create a happy thread   post something good that has happened to you today   a week ago     years ago whenever it can be something really huge   like you just got married   or something that may seem insignificant   like you found an old picture that made you smile it can also just be about anything that makes you happy in general i hope this thread can bring everyone  s spirits up   happy here  s my post today i got an email about volunteering as a latin teacher in south carolina over the summer   which i am really excited about i have an unhealthy love for all things classics   and i love working with kids so this is perfect for me it will also hopefully cure my restlessness from staying in one place for too long   bring on the happiness   everyone   
estp,hello <type>s   in this interview   i got a chance to talk to all the exxp types about their differences and similarities during the discussion   we discussed what causes exxps to feel anxious and how that feeling manifests in their bodies we also talked about the exxp  s ixxj swing and what that looks like for each individual exxp type it turns out that exxps also do n t like chaos and like to control things in their life the only difference is when chaos happens or plans get ruined   the exxps can easily pivot to other plans or feel calm when chaos hits next   the exxps discuss their issues with over gathering and what that looks like based on their type this part of the discussion was interesting because each type tends to over gather something completely different ranging from physical objects to information to values we also touched on double observing or the lack of teaching doing after consuming new information this leads us talking to the differences between info dominant and energy dominant exxps we then touched on people problems as an exxp and what that looks like and finally   we discussed ti being annoyed at ti and fi being annoyed at fe and even fe being annoyed at fe panel members were jany    <type> se te pb c    s    ff      tiana    <type> se fi cs p    b    ff      shane    <type> se ti cp b    s    mm      ian    <type> se fe pc s    b    ff      jacob    <type> ne fe pc s    b    ff      jake    <type> ne ti cp s    b    mm      annie    <type> ne fi cs b    p    mf      ashli    <type> ne te pc b    s    fm    for the first hour and me    <type> ne te pb c    s    mf    for the second hour watch this interview here

esfp,hello <type>s   in this interview   i got a chance to talk to candice about what it  s like to be an <type> se te pb s    c    ff one of the questions i asked candice is what it  s like to be the rare consume last <type> having double activated ni and double activated blast she said she did notice she has trouble trying new things unless she gets pressure from the tribe candice  s blast is apparent when she talks about being a serial entrepreneur and having sold a business before and loves starting new ones she  s a doer having saviour st play and double activated blast candice also talks about her double feminine play to double masculine sleep swing she will be nice and flexible with people but the feeling of resentment starts building up and she ends up blowing up on people the analogy i used is like taking a can of pop and shaking it until it blows up when someone opens it a little candice also talked about having trouble planning with her ni at the bottom    even if it  s double activated    and talks about her fear of ghosts and being alone watch this interview here 
estj,tell me what <type> stereotypes you have heard of this is in no way an attack on <type>  s this thread just gives awareness to the stereotypes of the <type> personality here is my list of <type> stereotypes      does not question the law      conservative      bullies      unprogressive      paranoid      bias towards their own beliefs      critical of others      strict      boring       direct and truthful when communicating with others 
isfj,hello   i am an <type> female   seeking advice on an <type> relationship so recently i met an <type> who really liked me he pursued me and after a while   i liked him back we went out and he even forced a kiss on me after that   he became kinda weird he still texted me daily   but he is reluctant to hang out   citing that he did n t want anything to happen he says we should just let nature takes its course when it comes to our relationship and he told me to reconsider it carefully because of the many obstacles we have    cultures   nationality   education   income    even his way of texting has changed like he became more passive and less involved he also seems reluctant to tell me personal information which he used to share however   there was this incident that just happened where i was sick and he rushed down to take me home so i reckon that he still likes me i just dunno what to do from here on is there a way to change the whole relationship dynamics again    or what should i do    
infp,so i  ve been overweight for most of life and i  ve only realized the true root of my overeating   which comes from eating the food that other people would throw away to remove the burden from them having to get up and throw the food away and the burden of the earth for producing food that has gone wasted    i come from a poor family and was taught this for all of my life    it  s taken me years to ponder this and actually digest that my gluttony comes from a place of selfnessless ever since then   i have learned about fasting and have become comfortable with turning down food i have also come to terms with my mortality and decided that one of my life long goals is to see my body in it  s peak condition before i am no longer able to maintain it and or die    bye bye me    these thoughts have been pushing to have dramatic weight loss and now i m daydreaming about building muscle as now i have turned being fit as something that was optional into something that is important i feel like <type>s would be attracted to the idea of having immense power and never actually using it    unless it was for protecting someone else    as well as being interested    both good and bad    of the feelings that are associated with building muscle   so what do you think    edit also   when i say bodybuilding i also mean weight lifting in general i do n t necessarily mean contorting your body into a super human shape for the sake of looking good but generally toning your body to be better than it once was 
estp,i was thinking about how my oldest daughter grad party is around the corner   and is being hosted at her dads lets just say there will be some haters there i told my oldest daughter that ultimately it was to celebrate her so that is what counts but i told her i will feel sorta like a lone ranger in many aspects while yes my family will be there etc too my family is not all up in my shit like her dad and his family and my friends of course will come yes my daughter told me i needed to spell out to my two best friends that they needed to be on stand by and get sitter and actually be present not simply attend she scolded me and said that people think i do not need support sometimes because of how i present myself i think i do not want to get let down i told one of my friends i would like her to actually come be my wing woman for the day fully attentive i think it will really hurt me if she is distracted with all her drama 
isfj,hello   i was wondering does it ever happen to you to check others  opinions   conclusions just to confirm your own   feel more confident    do you ever have those wait it does n t make sense is it really should n t it maybe this and look at others  comments to be more confident    validate your thoughts    a few days ago   i was watching an article comparing dogs to know which one is the strongest   i figured maybe it  s their physique as well as the strength of their bites but at the same time   i still checked the conclusion instead of just calling it a day after my theory and it can happen quite a lot to me does that happen to you    frequently    thanks in advance

estp,personal growth with my dual in socionics is almost like a dream after meeting such a person   i could n t take anything in my life for granted anymore i will let go of his flaws and not fuss over about it because he has the strength and abilities that i wish i had in me throughout our journey   there were of course challenges   misunderstandings   and predicaments that we experienced together he did things but i believe there was no evil intent in him at least in my eyes   he did n t his actions speak louder than the words he utters he took care of the practical things   my needs and i offer him some guidance in life despite him being almost   decades older than me when i first came to this site   i was awfully bleak   nothing to move forward in life until i had to study abroad and met this man who made an impact on me i m not sure about him though   i wish i did make an impact on him too it was rainy that morning   the streets were flooded and pedestrians were all covered in coats and they were all firmly holding their umbrellas we were both standing around the corner of the restaurant   utterly puzzled since he did n t bring an umbrella while i did i offered him to use it if he wants   but he refused because probably he did n t want me to share it with him the streets like i said were flooded i did n t trust myself since during that time i was wearing a long skirt just slightly below my ankles so not for long he held out his hand to me and without hesitation i took it we ran across the street   both held out our hands together since i trust him with all my heart it was the thrill for a long time i never felt so present i m grateful that my shoe was n t really wet   however   he is the one who is wet on that very same day   he bought an umbrella near the shops we passed by returning to my place he advised me to buy boots to which i replied there was no need for me to buy a pair of boots since i have an umbrella in the past he also tells me to buy many things which i genuinely think i do n t really need honestly anyway   i think it was one of those moments where i wish i can repeat it again 
entj,my sister is an <type>   mom   well liked in her community by a large circle of friends she has a lot of girlfriends   throws parties and other types of gatherings events several times a year she has a fairly calm demeanor and harmony focused when it comes to the group she does n t speak up or advocate for herself   even when she really should does n t want to rock the boat or cause problems i   on the other hand   am a train wreck when it comes to socialability not that i m an awkward dork who ca n t drum up conversation and have a good time kind of the opposite tbh and for sure i m a very intense person to be around and realize that people do n t always appreciate the force of my personality    note i m something like   th percentile for assertiveness and  th percentile for politeness in big      so in terms of personal relationships   i stick with a very small group of people that can handle being around me    my <type> partner   an <type> girlfriend and an <type> girlfriend    so the other day my sister advises that i need to make more friends for my kids  sake    in grade   and grade      that i should get to know my kids  friends parents   invite them over   be friendly   etc that i should n t be so reclusive and anti social    funny coming from an introvert    well   i strongly prefer that a friendship with another human develops organically rather than out of obligation and i  ve genuinely already tried to be friends with other mommies   who always seem to be busy or unavailable when i reach out for the kids  sake to do something i wo n t chase anyone for any reason   especially a social reason if they want to socialize with me   i m fine with that but no way i m going to keep reaching out if there is no reciprocity admittedly   i do n t care much for making friends if i think i ca n t be myself around them but i see my sister  s point in a way what can i do to not fuck it up and make myself more likeable and agreeable    is it possible to fake being a shrinking violet    the thought makes me feel slimy and inauthentic

infp,hello everyone   i m new here i decided to join the forums to hopefully get some opinions on something that  s been going around my mind for some time edited out for privacy reasons too many details so the deal is while i try to come to terms with my own issues   is this behaviour normal for <type>s    what  s your take    i m obviously not asking people to guess what he  s thinking   but i m very much confused 
istj,so i am a   m <type> chemist i fit most of the textbook descriptions of an <type> except i am not as organized and detail oriented as i would like to be   not really as stubborn   in romance i really need to warm up to someone first though some of the descriptions read like by the   th date i finally made a move and touched her hand hopefully kiss by the   th i am primarily relying on old i do n t go to many places where i meet women in real life i a pursuing women my age       without kids    do n t have do n t want    my dating history is nearly nonexistent i am not particularly sensitive to women  s attractiveness and most women are sufficiently attractive to me it is n t my primary criteria i think a biggest problem i am encountering is i just do n t know how to tease   banter   and flirt i have conversations ask questions   listen but in the end i often get told no chemistry my default state is kind of mr spock any tips    i have watched a lot of youtube videos and am envious of the natural charm those guys are able to exhibit but do n t feel i can do it effectively and genuinely

esfj,i recently got to know an <type> guy in a game and well   i must say he is a pretty awesome i enjoy the affection   the attention he s also quite funny i like him a lot but i seem to piss him off more often than i should ok so i have this tendency to think too deeply about things and i work through my emotions with people   on the fly and i ve done this a couple of times with him and he s always not taken it very well i used to date an <type> and <type> and both were super calm and walked me through it i m guessing it s because he s more emotionally in tune most recently   i got mad at myself for not performing well in a team fight and said that i was unhappy i have told him that it s not him that s making me upset    though he s in the equation because he could have joined me in the battle    but he seems to be taking it personally and i suspect it s because he can t fix the situation and make me feel better he has said that when i m happy he s happy and i think i legit pissed him off he s been curt and said he doesn t know how to talk to me    in case it trips me up    he also said i think too much and asked me to stop doing it    i e delving into things that are not true and not there    i can feel the unhappiness so how do i approach him should i leave him alone    i already said sorry 
intp,now   before you start   i know there  s no real  solution  to depression   but i was not going to define that in what little space i have in the title i can see already that many of you have depression just from skimming the forum i do n t frequent this corner much so instead of simply sharing stories i was hoping that you could offer me coping mechanisms   in particular maybe coping mechanisms that work for your type in particular have any of you managed to pull out of depression    how    have any of you have to cope with suicidal thoughts what do you do to fight this
