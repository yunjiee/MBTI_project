infp,"hi i ' m bambi a female type and born insomething just happened which gave me a fright and is causing me to go into a spin a little emotionally and i was hoping to check if some one could help i found some one online by chance and without looking for him a little earlier inand i think he could be an type because he could lead with fe a lot and we posted to each other about an objective area both care a lot about , and kind of clicked and over the months became close and although i could n ' t speak for him i felt emotionally intimiate and a lot of feelings including romantic ones and i ca n ' t fully describe it but i truly really really like and care about him a lot i found the person created a nd hidden page they were sending nice messages on , sometimes in the early hours of the morning , and they followed me over to another guy friend' s page on the nd hidden page , kind of to note they were watching me and almost like they were a little terrirotial and uncomfortable with me being close to another male , even though i had a clear conscience was n ' t trying to do anything crooked i think the type knew i really really liked them over time , more and more , although i noted there was always kind of a hidden key i did n ' t know which looked as though it was holding them back , and i thought he could of been a little afraid but i just learned he is married as he noted in a post a little earlier today a sentence about' my wife in'i feel st and foremost so bad and wrong inside for interfering with a married couple by accident and for trespassing against the type' s wife by accident who i did n ' t know was married to him i cried a lot falling asleep and today and feel a little freaked out and in shock and a little afraid of the type because i truly cared about him a lot and trusted in how our relationship was kind of unfolding and trusted all of the feelings i had for him could any one have any notes or ideas who could n ' t know us and maybe be outside of the situation about how i could be brave enough to come awayand not be in touch with the type who is married , to help protect his wife i truly feel so bad and all mixed up inside and ty for carefully reading and hope it could be better soon a note it' s possible i could n ' t have all of the information the type could know , and he mentioned his home was being sold and he was living with his dad a couple of months ago and was going through some things , and it could be he may of separated with his wife , although they are still legally married and maybe he had n ' t noted it before because he was separated , although i do n ' t know and am to afraid to say or do anything and feel like i cannot talk to him again because he has a wife and it feels unethical and i feel so wrong for tresspassing"

enfj,"there is a very outgoing female coworker who recently started working at the university( different department , same building ). she is quite attractive and appears to be very selfassured , pleasant , and gives off an impression of being outspoken and easygoing around people . however , when she first began working here , we would occasionally cross paths in the corridor , yet she would n ' t acknowledge me . so , i decided to take the initiative and introduce myself . things went smoothlywe engaged in some small talk . however , despite this , she continued to be a bit distant and chilly whenever we passed each other in the corridor , occasionally even ignoring me . as a result , i eventually gave up and moved on . surprisingly , several weeks later , she came up to me while i was with a group of colleagues at a university event and remarked ,' oh , you' re here, 'initiating a conversation exclusively with me . from that point on , whenever she encounters me , she seems genuinely enthusiastic to greet me . this positive shift made me to consider asking her out . coincidentally , we sometimes take the same train home and have started sitting across from each other during the commute . however , during these train rides , she once again appears a bit perplexed( which is contradictory to her behavior at work with colleagues ). she seems nervous , fidgety , and distant when we' re seated across from each other . i even have an intuitive sense that she might be feeling uncomfortable . yet , back within the university environment , she engages in teasing when we meet in the corridor , playfully mimicking my behavior . often she is at the other end of the corridor , always waving at me when she sees me . sometimes , she even passes by my office , pauses for a moment , and greets me with a cheerful' helloooo , insert my name. 'however , as soon as i turn around to respond , she simply smiles at me and quickly hurries away . i ' m left wondering whether this pattern of behavior aligns with common traits of an type personality . i ' m posing this question because i' ve developed an interest in her and would like to ask her out . however , her behavior on the train is somewhat confuses me."
isfj,"this is so long . i am sorry . i tried to be concise , but. . all the feelings.see tldr at the end. . i am a pretty trueblue type( with some j tendencies in work environments ), including the lovely ability to feel all the feelings and express none of them , especially when i may be slightly paranoid that expression of said feelings will not be wellreceived or may do more harm than goodi do n ' t worry so much about being judged for my choices or actions , but i do worry about how my feelings and their expression affect others and how they feel about me .( if you' re wondering what makes types hard to read. . that' s what it is. )i have had relationships with men all over the mbti spectrum , but vast majority nf or nts , which also represent most of my friends . so this whole sf thing is. . new territory. . i am now in a fairly new datingnotyetcommitted relationship with a man i very strongly suspect is typehe is a selfdescribed introvert and good listener , remembers details , has a lot of routines , is a dad and clearly has a very strong sense of duty toward his child( does very intentional and thoughtful things for him ), has had the same stable job for overyears , stubborn , values tradition and close friendships , etc . he was very forward and affectionate for the first couple of weeksdates( daily contact from the beginning ), and we had a fantastic connection and chemistry with lots of shared valuesgoals despite our very clearly opposite personality traits( which i can already see as complementarybalancing ), and then a tragedy in his close circle of friends required some shufflinguncertainty of dates during the third and fourth weeks , and he suddenly seemed quite distant , though at one point hein a frustratedbuttryingtostayteasing toneinformed me that i should act like i liked him if i liked him . i was confused , because i could tell he was being distant , though figured he surely was still interested if he wanted me to act interested , but could n ' t figure out why if that was true he was being distant in the first place , and then the distance persisted even as i reached out more . finally , it all came to a head , and through a very direct conversation about feelings on both sides , i had the massive aha !moment when he said that he thought i cared , and because i cared , that i would reach out frequently to check on him after the tragedy struck , and then i did n ' t , and then when he told me to act like i liked him if i did and iin a moment of confusion and paralysis of fear on being asked to actually express emotion directlysqueaked out something like i was trying to play it cool ? !i really like you , he was completely thrown off because he read that as gameplaying( rather than just my own insecurities )and so he had been acting distant because he felt distant and uncertain and oh i never explicitly thanked him for dinner( true storywhen i like someone my brain completely freaks out at the end of dates and i have no idea what i say and often realize likedays later that i did n ' t say thank you and feel terrible and embarassed but have always hoped that no one noticed. ) . . oof . miscommunication central .( meanwhile , in type girlland , i was trying not to come on too strong despite being totally smitten and trying to respect the fact that i' ve only known him for a couple weeks and so he probably does n ' t want me to be the person trying to reach out and support him because i care about him but i ' m not his girlfriend so i will just give him space to process the tragedy and let him show back up when he feels more stable and.wait where is he ? )so after we have this conversation and figure out that both of our interpretations were just totally off( i care very much and thought i was being caring by not pushing him to communicate with someone he barely knows during a very personally sad time , he is distant because he is feeling hurt and unappreciated , not disinterested ), i very timidly asked about moving forward and if these things are dealbreakers( and was certain he was going to be like , ugh , this is way too hard , no way , have a nice life ), and he was like what ? you' re great . of course i want to see you again. . oh . okay . yay !so . we' re moving forward , and have explicitly stated that our goals are simple , honest , and fun and that when i am feeling something , i will share it( which is , like , totally terrifying but also , you know , healthy. ). it was n ' t until after this conversation that i started hunting around for his mb type( he did n ' t know it when i asked him about it on our second date ), and when i read the type description , literally everything about what had happened became so clear , and it was like there was a spotlight on all the ways i had acted exactly oppositely from what he would have interpreted as totally interested and caring( and why i misread his cues as well ). the irony being( cue o ' henry. )that if i had just openly expressed my feelingswhich , given my allornothing nature , are typically considered a bit much by mostand texted on the regular when i was genuinely thinking about him , and stopped panicking about what he thought about me so much i lost all my manners , the miscommunication would have been solved .( he also could do with a little feelingsharing , but i know he thinks he wasand he technically wasit was just that i did n ' t get what the cause of the feeling was. )one challenge i ' m going on vacation , and our schedules do n ' t line up this week , so we wo n ' t see each other for like. .weeks( and the feelings conversation was by phone ). which at first made me anxious , because i feel like we' re going to lose all this momentum , but instead i am trying to see it as an opportunity to build a better foundation . therefore , i come humbly to you all to ask. .)does my overall interpretation of him as type seem accurate ?)we have not had a conversation about commitment , though i get the sense that what he would really like is what i might consider closer to girlfriendlevel communication , despite not having had that conversation .( this is not an issue for mei am certainly not dating anyone elseand fall heavily on the loyal , dedicated , and terrible at leaving bad relationships side of the types , rather than the grass is greener syndromeand i think if we had seen each other this weeknext week , that conversation would happen once we actually had interaction beyond the feelings talk and both felt like the decision to move forward was the right one , just. . timing. ). but it still is counter to , like , the majority of dating advice to be constantly reaching out to a man who has n ' t made an explicit commitment( i actually said something like this to himthat i did n ' t know him that well yet , to know what he would need in a time of personal tragedy , and that cultural wisdom was that you do n ' t smother a guy with interest in the beginning , and he was genuinely baffled at why i would ever , ever feel like i was overstepping my bounds or bothering him by reaching out to him , and thatreally great dates was enough permission. ). do you crazy fools really mean it when you say you want to hear all the positive affirmation and confirmation buzzing around in my spastic brain ? i mean.when i really like someone. . it' s a lot .)i do still feel like he is holding back and testing the waters a little , though it seems like expressing feelings isgaspactually working . is that the case , if you' ve been hurt and feeling like you ca n ' t fully trust the other person to appreciate younot walk all over you ? i mean , now that i understand why he was feeling that way , i totally get it , and i am happy to keep going with feels and affirmation and appreciativenesshell , i have whole lists stored up from the first few weeks , and basically getting begged to express them is kind of a dreambut with consistency in that as we move forward , the trust will come ?' cause , you know , we types like reciprocation example i had to be the one to reach out to verify plans or no plans for this week( we had been waiting for his schedule to be confirmed ), which was frustrating because he had said he would let me know , but since he did respond and with a somewhat guarded expression of disappointment that he had an unescapable commitment( for his child )on the only night that would have worked , i expressed disappointment that our schedules were n ' t lining up to see each other before my vacation , and then he said something about me forgetting all about him since it would be so long , i said something reassuring and teasing , and he came back with ca n ' t wait to hear about the vacationit was like he was waiting to see if i was really going to follow through on my end before he started reciprocating interest again . but it did make me feel like things were progressing in the right direction , after like a week of getting polite , pleasant , and positivebut limitedresponses to my texts . tldri think he is telling me that he means what he says and says what he means , and he likes hearing all my warm and fuzzy feelings about him . all the time . and if i ' m confused , i can ask , and he will tell me what is going on . he says he' s simple , and that i am overcomplicating matters by worrying about how he will react to my natural instinctsexpressions of feeling , and to stop it and just talk to him . this sounds too good to be true . is it really that simple ? are you all unsmotherable if you really like someone? ?( assuming i allow some alonedown time , which i absolutely have no issue with , as i need it , toooh , and not making , like , crazy big jumps into futuretalk because. . no. ) "

isfj,"has anyone met an type with avoidant attachment ? i am dating an type , we get on well until there' s a problem and i try and discuss it . for example when i was in the hospital he disappeared fordays and didnt contact me . i eventually asked why he did that and he kept giving me excuses . he often disappears and gives excuses . when i try and discuss something he sees conflict and avoids . he ca n ' t answer or solve an issue and just tries to end the relationship or ignore me . the other thing is that he has no friends and spends all his time alone or overworking . he acts very nice on the outside but always feels distant and uncaring . he cuts people off as soon as they get close and prefers to rely on himself . im beyond frustrated by it but i rarely see any posts about avoidant types."
enfj,"i need help deciding if im an type or an typewhat do you like to think about ? and what do you like to do ? im not sure what i like thinking about besides mbti and the universe , how we came here , and why we exist . i wonder about it a lot , with religion and stuff , which is why im agnostic . things i like to do are writing stories( but i always end up never surpassing the first chapter because i dont think its good enough ), listening to music , feeling busy( even though im really lazy at home and dont do anything ).what are your biggest fears ? i seriously fear dying . like what happens after death ? do you just die and thats it ? i want to impact people before i die so that way if i just die and thats it , at least people will remember me for things ive accomplished . i dont understand how some people dont fear death , because i do a lot . or how they dont wonder where we come from or why we exist or why things work the way they do .what do you feel responsible for ? i feel like i have this responsibility to be a good daughter , have good grades , etc . my parents are strict , and they want me to have a high gpa , have all as , etc . right now , i have a. and all my grades are as except for precalc and physics( though i have finals tomorrow so this can change ). but theres this responsibility to be what they want me to be vs . who i want to be . i feel like im constantly struggling with this choosing to submit to them or be myself .what makes you happy ? im not sure i dont feel happy . i can get excited and stuff , but im not sure . i dont think ive been genuinely happy since th grade . so i cant really answer that question .do you like to help others ? why ? i love helping others . i want to make an impact on people very badly . like when im at my job , taking customers orders , delivering food to them that makes me feel worthwhile and that im helping them . compared to when they put me on dining room , i always ask to switch to a different position because its boring and i dont feel like im helping others . i always like feeling busy and accomplished , compared to my other friends , who like to just feel relaxed . what do you do with your emotions ? depends . i think my emotions are pretty visible on my face . i guess id say i feel them , though with my parents , im very stoic with them because of how strict they arewere .do you have values ? which ? my main values are being kind , not being racist , homophobic , things of that nature . idk why , but imand a junior in high school , and im pretty flexible on things , but my values are somehow debatable with others ? like ableism i tell people the rword is a slur , and theyll still continue to say it and say i was the problem when i unfriend them . or when i tell my friend that hating other poc is racist and they get all mad because i unfriend them . like it makes no sense . when i first found out people were ableist or homophobic , i debated on unfriending them because i didnt want to lose them , but now , i dont really give a shit . either ill unfriend them or just let the friendship die if were not close . i dont understand how people can still be friends with people who are homophobic and whatnot .what do you consider before making a decision ? i like to hear others opinions before making a decision . ill go around asking friends for their opinions or ill look online at reviews , videos , etc . and gather intel before making a decision . i do this a lot , like pretty much. if many people say its good , then ill try it and see how it works for me .what are your wishes or goals in life ? i want to be famous , but not super famous , just known a little bit . i want to inspire people and make others think of me in a good light . i want to be talented in many areas over the summer , i want to maybe start learning japanese since i already know three languages , english , spanish , and jamaican patois . i do wish to be happy though , but thats kind of unattainable since happiness isnt permanent , but only temporary .do you think it' s important to live in society ? idk its your life . people can choose what they wanna do . to live , then yeah , but the word society can vary depending on how one chooses to look at the word .they are spreading false rumors and gossip about you . how do you feel about it and what would you do ? id be pissed and wonder why they did it . i probably wouldnt confront them , unless they were my friend . otherwise , i would just be pissed and wonder what others think of me now .would you changehide your opinion to fit into society ? depends on the topic if its something i care deeply about , then no . i usually kind of express my opinion on how i feel about things regardless , unless i feel selfconscious and im burdening others or people think im weird . then ill just change my opinion so others wont think im being weird .someone is making fun of you publicly . what would you do in this situation ? if its my friend , i laugh it off , but might feel a little insecure . if its someone i dont know , ill probably remain quiet and shrink up and i wont really say or do anything .what do you thinkfeel about the future ? im not sure . i dont really think of it that much maybe it will be better . hopefully . the closest i get to thinking about it is what my life will be like and how ill be .what irritates you ? depends on the situation ngl . i feel like for many questions , it depends on the situation , so theres no clearcut answer . but things that usually irritate me are throat noises people make when their throat itches , sniffling , excessive nose blowing , things like that .how do you see yourself ? sarcastic , insecure , imaginative , naive , shy , loud , outspoken , bold .what would be an ideal world for you ? a society where we all live in harmony . a society where slavery , racism , colonization never existed . we would all have our original languages and cultures instead of being forced into new ones . there would be no hate , but only love .is the object( external facts )or the subject( internal opinions and assumptions )more important to you ? probably external facts .do you look for meaning in life internally or externally ? probably externally , since i look outward for answers about what meaning means."

entp,i ' m just curious as to what you guys might notice about your eating habits . as for odd eating habits.the only thing i can think of for myself really is that i have this weird thing with the texture of food . ca n ' t be slimy or soggy mostly . i eat my bowls of cereal dry without any milk or spoon.i ca n ' t eat banana' s if they are too ripe or i gag.i ca n ' t eat oatmeal with fruit in it because it gets slimy . i also do n ' t care for certain foods touching other foods but i ' m not that bad about it like some people . they can touch but if something wet were to make something that was supposed to be dry soggy then i get pissed . i also apparently put too much ketchup on everything.
istj,"hello types !in this interview , i got a chance to talk to jamie and cherie about their similarities and differences as a standard and jumper type type . for context , the jumper type type simply jumps over the te and becomes si and fi first as oppose to si and te . we started the interview with cherie and jamie talking about their observer problems with their phones . then , we jumped into the topic of talking about the feeling of disrespected for the standard type and getting tribe hate from the jumper type . cherie and jamie started making fun of me and said that all nt' s like wearing cardigan and it' s a nerd thing( looks like i' ll have to start wearing my cardigan on some interviews ). this interview was actually really funny , with the types observer problems , making fun of self and tribe , and their weirdness with consuming new information . during our discussion about consuming new information , both jamie and cherie said they get really weird about consuming new information . they said all they want is to consume what they' ve already seen but they' re not allowed because that' s cheating and you need to consume something new . we also started talking about being a double decider and funny enough we started both praising and making fun of ixxp types( double deciders have to be balanced with praising and making fun of otherwise , it becomes weird ). it' s all in good fun of course because we like ixxps as friends . cherie and jamie also started talking about their masculine ne and how their predictions tend to be wrong . they said they feel confident about it because it' s masculine but because it' s a demon , they do n ' t feel responsible for making sure their prediction is right . finally , we talked about the fisi identity and how it' s not good to tie the identity to your role or job . instead , you need to look at your role or job and see if they tick all the boxes in your topvalues . if it ticks all the boxes then it' s the right job for you and if not then continue the search . watch this interview here"
istp,"as you all know by now , being an type has some drawbacks . one of those happens to be in dealing with others . we do n ' t play well with others . anyway , i' ve noticed we do n ' t whine very much . and if we do , it' s usually at the inability to solve a problem , being overwhelmed , the stress that comes with daily life , etc . it does not , however , come from a sense of entitlement like most other people . we often hold our heads up high with anticipation with what' s to come with a steely resolve that is absent in most people . so.what happens in turn ? people dump their crybaby bullshit on us . for years , i thought i was holding auditions for baby mario , fer god' s sake . whaaaa !whaaaaa !whaaaaaaaa !and well.you know.it' s me . i do n ' t knowmaybe i ' m weird or something , but i did the conventional thing and tried to comfort people like the tv told me to do , or be nice to them or whatever you' re supposed to do when somebody is shamelessly fishing for cheap attention . you know that scene in inglourious basterds where brad pitt uncomfortably imitates an italian director and ca n ' t even get past the thick hillbilly accent ? there' s your analogy for me and comforting others . thoughts on this?"

infj,"i ' m going to get roasted , but here we go .yr . relationship and marriage to type which i totally damaged by being insensitive , blind , uncaring , lacked understanding , selfish , and entitled . just to name a few . i was largely oblivious to who she really was as a person . she tried the first decade for harmony and equality , accommodation , recognition and more . slowly she closed off and distanced for the next decade just to keep family together and keep peace , avoid stress and conflict . for several years now she contemplated leaving . only recently after i had a breakthrough and saw myself as being the reason for most of the unhappiness did i realize who she was and what i had missed and done to her and our marriage . i was profoundly sorry and regretful . i owned it all . a few weeks later she asked for a separation . i also was aware of her new platonic relationship with her boss , mentor , friend , confidant . they relate on multiple levels , particularly communication , interests , humor and profession . he' s even more introverted . we' ve reconciled . i ca n ' t believe it . still living together and in counseling . i ' m the luckiest man on the planet , to get another chance with her . i' ve learned an immense amount about her that i' d totally missed or never looked for in the past . i get and see and understand her like i never had before . i now love and care for her multiple times more and it is the most beautiful , intriguing , attractive , heartwarming feeling i could imagine . she actually came back into our marriage and has turned towards me . i ' m ecstatic . i' ve changed multiple things about myself and how i acted with her . i want this relationship , love and marriage more than anything . she also has not changed any of her incessant engagement with her boss after hours , regardless of how i' ve felt about it . she engages with him morning and night , whether i ' m there or not . she seeks out interests of his and shares interests of hers . i trust her . unconditionally . he has a history of infidelity , with a previous subordinate in her current role . i know he cares deeply for her and is likely in love with her . she has not engaged generally like that with him , but i know his intentions are to have a relationship with her if she allowed it , even with her marriage . she has said multiple times that i have nothing to worry about . i know she wo n ' t have a physical relationship with him if she is still in her marriage . he' s not aware of our situation , but obviously as an intuitive , sees her needs clearly . we are planning trips and a future with our growing family of grandchildren what can i do to protect her from him ? what can i do to protect myself ? how can this possibly play out ? i ' m intimidated and feel inadequate . i probably deserve it all . i ' m so regretful that this happened to her , to us . she deserved a better marriage , i ' m going to try and give it to her now , for the rest of my life."
enfj,"how differently do type and type use their fe ? theoretically extroverted feelers are labelled as being selfless . in my case , i feel i am only selfless in order to protect myself . i' d try to make others happy and make sure they have a good experience so i do n ' t feel their negative emotions in me . i' d say type uses fe in a more proactive way while type uses it in a reactive way ? theoretically fe is also labelled as being manipulative . i think about this a lot as i am quite manipulative . for example i' d be saying things with the purpose of making someone feel good about herself so she does n ' t get jealous of me . it is almost a way showing to her hey i am not your enemy i pose no threat . if it means i have to tell a little lie to compliment her arch or feet in a dance class , for the sake of a good experience we are both going to have , i do n ' t mind or never feel guilty about it . my type girlfriend always calls me fake or a doormat . but i do n ' t understand what it is wrong of creating harmony by telling a little harmless lie?"
esfj,"hello types !in this interview , i got a chance to talk to all the exxj types about their shared experiences and what makes them different from one another . during the interview , we talked about exxjs having trouble making a decision for themselves and needing permission from the tribe before making decisions . we also talked about te shaming ti and fe shaming fi . savannah asked an awesome question to the type and types on how te' s can be more sensitive to ti' s and not offend them . we also discussed what their ti or fi swing looks like when they go on a selfishness swing . we also discussed racist jokes and how they perceived it as an exxj . we also talked about blood and family ties and how the type and type perceived it differently from the type and type . double observing was something we tried discussing but the topic was too boring for the exxjs to continue talking about because it' s so easy for them . in the end , the exxjs had a message to say to fellow exxjs on how to better themselves as individuals . some things i noticed about each participant include julia( type and our only infodominant exxj )did an amazing job maintaining the flow of the conversation being balanced with her sife and neti . maggie( our jumper type )was relatively quiet and focused on gathering the tribe' s perspective . rob( our jumper type with double activated ti and token male exxj )was acting very exxp like with committing to decisions . savannah( our jumper type )asked some very good questions to the lead fe' s . nina( our jumper type and only lead nt )was doing a makeshift double decider which shows how present that masculine fi is at the bottom when double activated . natalie( our type and only mf )produced many hilarious moments including before the interview with her blast to nina just seconds after learning something from julia . and finally , heather shows the big difference between an type and type when it comes to dealing with presenting themselves to the tribe . i also thought it was interesting that julia being infodominant was not as scared of how the tribe perceived her as the energy dominants were . julia said she can clarify with the tribe which shows the easy flow of information while natalie said she never thought of asking the tribe and just assumed everyone hated her . watch this interview here"
intp,"i seem to be very good at it . i make very sensible bets and so far have lost, but won over. i usually bet in play , during games , and spot little flaws in the thinking of the admins of the site . i' ve been around a lot of gamblers who seem to think i ' m just lucky , but they throw away hundreds and silly bets and are tempted by the potential winnings."
esfj,i hear that' s the ideal partner for an type i do n ' t know if i have ever even met an type ? so wondering what it' s like to date one ? from some of what i read on thepersonality' s website it sounded like someone i would wanna date . so yeah any input on this would be great also where to find one ? since im introverted lol and im female btw if that makes any difference.

isfj,"most people probably do n ' t think that commonly seen traits in autism spectrum disorder( asd )are very similar to those of an type . however , the description fits me to a tespecially the range of jobs( they are all ones i' ve either wanted to hold at some point in my life or have held ). i am a social worker . as a child and teen i dreamed of being a doctor , and have previously worked in customer servicehealth administration as an adult . i am ayear old married female who was diagnosed with asperger' s syndrome at age. while i had received various mental health diagnoses and was on medication from the age ofon , i did n ' t find out what was really up until i got my diagnosis . here' s the irony i obtained a master of social work due to my interest in social justice and political activism . i graduated inand was unemployedseverely underemployed( very part time retail )formonths . the diagnosis came about as a result of a worsening mental health issues during that time . part of the goal of my diagnosis was to help me find out more about what i could do as a career since social work was n ' t working out . however if you are familiar with asd then you probably know that its defining characteristic is perceived by many to be a marked lack of empathyso i began to look for completely different types of jobs( courtroom stenographer was one i seriously considered )while feeling bad about not being able to use my credentials . during that time through my fianc( it' s always a connection !)i got a job as a receptionist in an agency that provides therapy to children with disabilities such as asd . in the over a year since i got there , i have been able to start receiving therapy and am seeing several specialists for my medications and the health issues that followed me from that dark time of unemployment , trauma from a year and a half spent working for a horrifically abusive dentist boss and years of improperly treated mental health issues . this has enabled me to be promoted to a role performing initial assessment and intake for families seeking services at our clinici excel at it , am inspired every day , have great working relationships with colleagues and i am finally using my education . this post is starting to feel selfabsorbed , so i will stop now . please share your thoughts on types and autism"
esfp,"idk if this the right space to say it but i ' m also delaing with the same i' ve major depression and dealing with suicidal thoughts lioe nearly everyday i feel suicidal i ' m feeling everything negative nothing gives me joy anymore . i feel life has nothing to offer . alot of bad stuff happened with me in the past that i ' m still not able to get over with . i lost my mom last year due to cancer . also i had some career issues in the past . im not liking my current environment and not able to accept the changes around me . everything feels dull . it feels like a major part of me is lost somewhere . i was diagnosed with adjustment disorder in the past . also i' ve major depression . so i feel very agitated and irritated and impulsive . it feels like things arent going my way ,things are not happening in my favour.i still feel angry for whatever happened in my life . i ' m not able to process th grief idk how do i go with life . i also tried therapies before but nothing worked out i lost all hope everything seems pointless to me . life is n ' t making sense to me . also i feel worthless and do n ' t like myself . i did alot of mistakes in my past that i still regret alot . i feel no urge to live . i do n ' t know but i do n ' t feel any reason to live.i feel angry everyday and feel aggressive . idk what to do?"
enfp,"today i had a rude awakening , the kind that you only invite when you try to explain to someone who unintentionally hurt you what you learned from them hurting you . it made me understand that my world view and optimism are based on the idea that there is meaning in learning . ibelieved that the purpose of life is to learn and to become a better person , but what if further perspective means that the lessons i learned so strongly were wrong when given more time and perspective . even if they were true for me at the moment , what if they never apply to anything current or future ? will i be able to even help others ? i always want to write a book to make people feel and learn , and maybe by reading what i went through and learned then they can feel less alone and understand the lesson i learned but hopefully without the heartache of years . i was raised with stories that happened to people during world warand i thought my whole generation learned racism was wrong , that oppressed people have voices to be heard . ive been thinking lately that we forgot these lessons and that now people are focused on what they are learning and the problems alive today . i had an optimism that by the time i was older there would be equality . it seemed it was going that way . then i think that my generation hasnt done enough for climate change , yet we might be the last generation who really remember playing outside before the internet . who remember how loud the bees were in every bush and tree , who know how few birds and frogs there are now compared to how it was when i was a kid . and i dont think there is really anything truly wild anymore , maybe only up in northern regions , but there was when i was a kid . so this lesson will it mean the same to any future group ? i was realizing all at once that my optimism is based on the importance of learning and that simultaneously i was learning that my learning wasnt so important and then , to save me , a wave of humor comes into my heart making me laugh at myself , love myself and know that this moment in time is as important as any future understanding and still serves that same purpose of letting me know im not alone and others will not be alone . other things explored today was the cult out there of twinflames . a friend who asked me yesterday can i ask you , are you living the life that you want to ? and thoughts about unresolved trauma and how i deal with it . this might be my new diary."
intp,i' ve noticed i miss hear what people say often . i ' m not deaf or anything lol . i do n ' t know maybe its because i ' m not always fully listening i could be thinking about something . or i just think someone said something which they did n ' t . then i only half hear what they say . it could just be me on this one.
infp,"before mbti and enneagram , i felt both frightened and enraged by te doms . after these theories i understand that they have tremendous energy , almost booming out of control in their bodies all the time . i cannot pretend to understand what life must feel like as a te dom . nonetheless , there is a degree of compassion when i see them relieving their tremendous energy in a burst of some inane sexual joke that is not funny , amusing , or even meaningful in any remote sense . it was just some excess energy that got spent . like fart . however , throughout my life , i have also found myself at the receiving end of these jokes . i have tried to enjoy these . but they are so dull . always around the same ideainsertion , penetration , opening and some ostentatious details attached to these so they sound less obnoxious than they are . somehow , an idea of masculinity is also associated with these jokes but i do n ' t see how . i use sufficient swear words in my daily life . i am not opposed to obnoxious language . it has an antiestablishment sort of a purpose . but i cannot forget that these very men who are pretentiously using this language are also thoroughly committed to the system . so , it does not bode well with me that these( not all te doms , but the ones around me )people use this language . they do n ' t have that depth . it' s just that excessive energy that becomes so irksome sometimes . i can go snobbish about it . i can express my compassion in a cutting way . i have to try something . i venting here but if someone has some thoughts about this , you are welcome to respond . that' s why this post is not on the vent thread."
istp,"hello types !in this interview , i got a chance to talk to heather on what it' s like to be an type tise csb ( p )fm . this interview was super interesting because you rarely get a chance to talk to an officially typed type female . they almost do n ' t exist !and to make this another rare interview opportunity , heather is also the super rare fm type !one thing i noticed was that because of gender roles , an type female like heather has better use of her fe than male types . heather also has double masculine nf blast( nife )making her nf quite strong . she is still doing the typical type st report( tise ), but because it' s double feminine , it' s not as in your face as her nife . because of her play last( sefe ), she tends to lose energy rather quickly and she also disrespects sf play as a result . she' s aware of how important sf is but she hates it so it' s work in progress for her to improve on it . she' s also looking to doing more hiit based cardio exercise to increase her energy levels which is what she has the most issues with . because she' s still an ixxp , she has people problems and has dealt with tribe hate , especially in her younger days . overall , it was an insightful interview and there are definitely some differences when you see the male and female variations of the same personality type . watch the interview here"
istj,"hello types !in this interview , i got a chance to talk to jessica about what it' s like to be an type sifi sbc ( p )fm . the first thing i noticed is jessica' s feminine si and despite it being her lead function , she has a bad memory . we also discussed her double feminine sf sleep and how she tends to have an identity crisis and does n ' t feel confident about things she processed . she said she also tends to forget the story of the shows she watches and needs to see them again and again . jessica said that her nt play last comes out at night and sometimes makes it harder to sleep . so , she started doing martial arts to deal with the extra energy at the end of the day . jessica is very infodominant and even if she does n ' t want to gather new information , she will for the sake of accuracy . she said there are times she would not text back a friend until she has googled the info well enough that she can provide them with an accurate reply . jessica also talked about her big road trip in western united states and how it fed her nf consume and gave her a sense of excitement and gratitude after returning back home . watch this interview here"

istj,"all the types have such unique perspectives in our world . i ' m curious about how the different types tend to experience travel . so i ' m asking all you types do you like traveling ? why or why not ? if so , how muchhow important is it to you( is it something you enjoy or something you make a point of getting as much as you can in )? what sorts of things stick with you from traveling ? certain people you met , the experience of being in a new culture on the whole , particular places , the art , the natural landscapes , etc. ? if you like traveling , what about it attracts you ? do you tend to gravitate towards what aspects of travel ? do you like it as a thrilling adventure or as a way to relax ? are you drawn to places where you can experience more culture or more settingslandscapes ? lots of questions , answer whatever you' d like , and anything else you think of"
infp,"it' s a bit shocking to me how rapidly and meaningfully public discourse has changed in the past couple of years regarding unidentified objects in the sky . with the revelation of programs like aatip in the u.s . and military sensor data being released into the public . while it' s still unclear what we' re seeing in the sky it has become increasingly clear that there is something actually being seen , it' s no longer hillbillies and stories now it' s military officers and civilian pilots with recordings on advanced sensor systems . we' ve even seen the former head of the israeli space agency come forward with some albeit fantastical tales , but i ' m stumped as to what would motivate him to lie about this . why would someone who spent decades as a decorated military officer and subsequent architect and leader of their nations space program burn their legacy to the ground ? though i' ll acknowledge that his assertions are really hard to accept . now we even have mainstream news treating the subject with some degree of seriousness for the first time since the sixties . this was released just today i think. . i have no idea what the ship recorded , but it was n ' t swamp gas or a weather balloon , and if it is a drone who is making drones with technology decades or more in advance of the best the world has to offer ? what are we seeing ? and why has a government who has spent decades stifling an issue now reversed course entirely ? thoughts?"

estp,basically i investigated who would be interviewing me after the recruiter gave me their names i looked them up on linkedin i showed her the women explained its two administrators in their s . i asked her if i should dress like myself in my typical business casual or wear ugly clothes to be more vulnerable looking . she said wear ugly clothes and not to dress to impress so she found a sweater blouse thing that id usually pair with something completely different . the sweater is perfect it makes me look larger than i am . found some outdated but barely worn boots as well yes this could sound ridiculous to people possibly but i do not want to come off overpowering or too bold . we found the perfect ugly polished outfit for the interview . i will also wear my ugly glasses and put my hair in a low pony
esfp,"hello types !in this interview , i got a chance to talk to jaclyn about what it' s like to be an type sete pcb ( s )mm . during the interview , jaclyn talked about her masculine se and gathering facts and combined with her kinesthetic sexual modalities , also like hitting a punching bag . she also said that her double masculine st play makes her unable to say no at work even if she is already burdened with too many tasks and she just soldiers on and gets it done . with her sf consume , she tends to be paranoid of hotels and checks to make sure everything is clean from coffee makers to bedsheets , pillowcases , etc . jaclyn also talked about her feminine fi and how when she was young , she could tell she was n ' t like the other girls but despite that , she still felt very feminine inside regardless . jaclyn also talked about her difficulties with ni and while she has some use of her nt blast , the nf sleep is a challenging area for sure . watch this interview here"
enfj,"hi hi hi , for context i am an type female and i had a really incredible date with this type last week . it' s funny because i really was n ' t intending on even seeing him at first . we met on a dating app aboutmonths ago and he always came across really sweet in messages( and he was definetly my type )but things would happen which would cause us to lose contact . in one instance he took two days to respond to me( which i later found out was because he was at an airsoft competiton? ? doing outdoor type things i guess? ? )but it turned me off because i did n ' t appreciate the switch up of being completely dedicated and attentive to just suddenly disappearing . i also could n ' t be sure if he was being honest , or just felt like ignoring me . i felt myself becoming insecure and those negative feelings caused me to respond less and less and then not at all . he was very persistant , however , and eventually we did meet last week . and i left that date thinking that finally meeting him was the best choice of my life . i thought he felt the same way , as he texted me as soon as he got home and all throughout this week . then yesterday , his replies were very slow . i am used to him taking a bit of time inbetween replies but that day he did n ' t text me good morning or at all throughout the day until about pm . he apologized and said he had n ' t seen my messages( i frequently get this kind of text from him. . but it never bothered me because his apologies always seemed sincere ). he then asked me if i was busy this weekend to which i responded yes( i ' m going to london tomorrow )and after a bit more small talk he asked me if there was any chance that i would be free tonight . i was immeadiatly elated and was already in the process of mentally planning what i would wear . i immeadiatly texted back saying i can be . did you want to hang out ? he waited two hours to respond and then said i did want to hang out but im too tired . i didnt go to the gym today either . i was of course upset that he made me wait two hours just to say no , but i was more so sad because i actually genuinely wanted to see him( and i rarely genuinely want to go anywhere that is n ' t the comfort of my own home ). i still forced myself to think positively though because it meant a lot to me that he even wanted to see me in the first place . i said oh ok)). and that was that( keep in mind im leaving out the other little casual conversations we were having in between all of this , when talking to him i always try to match energy and be just as kind . he can be quite caring and complimenty and i always try to reciprocate that so he feels appreciated ). but today he has n ' t texted me at allno contact and its pm . as i mentioned , the way he replies has been something that' s bothered me since we first met . i genuinely do n ' t know what to do because i do think he is a good guy , but i just opperate under the assumption that if you like someone you talk to them throughout the day . even if you' re a bad texter , you at least send a good morning or ask how their day went ? i was a bit dry with the last message i sent to him , as i was a little upset and its hard for me to hide that , but i still do n ' t think thats any excuse ? what do you think ? is this normal ? why would he wait so long to tell me he ca n ' t see me and then just not talk to me after that ? i almost want to say something about it , ask if he' s ok or if he' s uninterested( more so i can just stop expending mental energy towards his actions )but it' s really not in my nature to do something like that and i would hate to come across as clingy or bossy . i ' m not , i do n ' t ever want to make him talk to me if he does n ' t want to . i more just want to know why his texting is so unreliable . it causes me to spiral and write long essay style posts on mbti forums ."

enfj,"they tested as an type and i even typed them as one as i do see ni in them , but what happened today and in the past has made me wonder .. they yelled at someone forminutes straight today. they said that the person they were yelling at should' ve have been beaten growing up .. they threatened to destroy the computer of said person they were yelling at as they were ignoring them while they were yelling at them . b . has actually destroyed the phone of her husband once by throwing it out the window as she suspected him of cheating( he was n ' t  ! ). they think millennials are the worst generation and that they are ruining the world compared to how things were in the past as they claimed back then someone' s word was someone' s word or something .. they said that people coming from different places in the world are ruining where they live , and that the people that were born in the areas are the ones that are honest or something .. they also threatened to not pay the internet bill( which the entire household uses )just because said person was not paying attention to them while arguing .. they said that they are trying to make things peaceful as a person is on their deathbed in the household , and make things calm for their last days .. yet they yell at said person on their death bed and even tells them that they are going to die if they wo n ' t eat , and said that black folks do n ' t listen( dw they are black themselves )and that a white person would appreciate the efforts( the person on their death bed has dementia ). they say to always love your parents and gave an example of how someone she knows was beaten so hard by her father that her skin turned blue and that she still loves and support her father .. she is the cleanest person ever , and in a hotel the maids even said that they have never seen a person as clean as her . i am starting to think no of them being an type , but maybe it is possible for them to be just unhealthy i think."

isfj,"another perc member suggested that we should have an introduction thread in the type forum . i thought it was a great idea . it seems like there are a number of types who look at our forum and just lurk because they do n ' t feel comfortable posting . being a shy , sensitive type type myself , i can understand what that feels like . but my favorite thing about the type forum is that it' s such a warm , welcoming place.i feel like i can post anything and feel safe so i figure this can be a formal place where some of the more frequent type posters can share some things about themselves , and maybe it will help give some new types a starting point too . so here are a few general questions for types to answer . do n ' t feel like you have to answer all of them if you do n ' t want to , and definitely feel free to share or add on anything else you want . i just thought maybe this could be a starting point .. what' s your ageage range ?. where are you located ?( city , state , country , region ). what' s your current occupationjobcareer ?. what' s your current social situation( marriedrelationshipsingle , or can name familyfriendspets too ).. what' s something you' re interested in or like to do ?. what' s something that you really like about yourself , especially as an type ?. what' s something that you find tough about being an type ?. what' s something quirkyinterestingunique about you ? i' ll start !here are my answers. i ' m ayear old male type .. i live in north carolina in the southeastern united states .. i teach high school math .. i ' m single and gay with no pets , and i live alone . i have some very close friends and family members that i love deeply , though .. i like to go hiking , play video games , watch movies , watch lots of sports , play pool , gamble , and travel .. more than anything , i ' m a super loyal person to those that i care about . i feel like i' ll stick with them to the end .. i overworry about things too much , especially when i have no good reason to .. i still have my childhood teddy bear( he' s in my avatar ). i' ve loved him since i was a kid , i still like to cuddle him , and i sleep with him every night . see , not too hard , right ? and if i can admit that i ' m ayear old man who still sleeps with his teddy bear , i know you types can feel comfortable sharing anything about yourselves !

isfj,"hello , i was wondering. . does it ever happen to you to check others 'opinions , conclusions just to confirm your own , feel more confident ? do you ever have those wait.it does n ' t make sense.is it really.should n ' t it.maybe this. . and look at others 'comments to be more confident ? validate your thoughts ? a few days ago , i was watching an article comparing dogs to know which one is the strongest , i figured maybe it' s their physique as well as the strength of their bites. . but at the same time , i still checked the conclusion instead of just calling it a day after my theory . and it can happen quite a lot to me. . does that happen to you ? frequently ? thanks in advance !

istp,"so i got thinking , again . types are known as the rebel types . we very rarely conform to any particular norm and when we even sense that we are we immediately rebel against it . we do things against others wishes . we do n ' t care for most people in general . and we generally do n ' t like being controlled . does that mean are actions are spiteful in nature as most of our actions are in effect rebellious against the norm ? can we really be detached completely from petty emotions when we take these actions ? and what if we are n ' t aware of it?"

infj,"hi everyone . i used to post on here a long time ago . great that the place is still around . even the poem thread still exists . cool . i have cptsd . i go to therapy , i ' m doing the work , and i am getting better . a lot . and have , for awhile . recently i wanted to look up an type personality profile again , because of a conversation i was having with someone about the decade of recovery work i had been doing , which started with the myers briggs . i had gotten out of a bad situation , and maybe i just really needed to feel seen at the time , but i remember sobbing reading the type profile for the first time . reading it again , overyears later , i had a very different reaction . it felt like they were describing the coping mechanism of people that experienced prolonged trauma in a situation they cannot escape from . it felt like the personality that is being described is that of unrecognized trauma , because i recognize that person as the traumatized labor of love who did n ' t yet know how to deal with all these feelings and experiences he was having , and who did n ' t have a context to make sense of them , yet . so , i got curious . i ' m going to post the list of traits of adult children of alcoholics and dysfunctional families , and i ' m wondering if any of you guys resonate with it . the laundry listtraits of an adult child of an alcoholic or dysfunctional family we became isolated and afraid of people and authority figures . we became approval seekers and lost our identity in the process . we are frightened by angry people and any personal criticism . we either become alcoholics , marry them or both , or find another compulsive personality such as a workaholic to fulfill our sick abandonment needs . we live life from the viewpoint of victims and we are attracted by that weakness in our love and friendship relationships . we have an overdeveloped sense of responsibility and it is easier for us to be concerned with others rather than ourselves this enables us not to look too closely at our own faults , etc . we get guilt feelings when we stand up for ourselves instead of giving in to others . we became addicted to excitement . we confuse love and pity and tend to love people we can pity and rescue . we have stuffed our feelings from our traumatic childhoods and have lost the ability to feel or express our feelings because it hurts so much( denial ). we judge ourselves harshly and have a very low sense of selfesteem . we are dependent personalities who are terrified of abandonment and will do anything to hold on to a relationship in order not to experience painful abandonment feelings , which we received from living with sick people who were never there emotionally for us . alcoholism is a family disease and we became paraalcoholics and took on the characteristics of that disease even though we did not pick up the drink . paraalcoholics are reactors rather than actors . tony a . , "
entj,"you guys might want to check out this post i made to type forum . i got pretty controversial outcome from these answers . id appreciate also your opinion on this original matter . seems like , i got some good info from our introverted colleagues , but also my fair share of wellearned criticism . quoting myself , something i really love . this is especially for you type females . i hope you can give me your opinion in an abjective manner , without taking a side of neither of us . i have female type coworker , that i had this romantic relationship for few months . today we are friends or something , i ' m actually not sure about what is the status of two of us . the relationship we had started really sparkling and we soon became lovers after getting really know each other . actually we had been working together at same company for few years before our patches crossed . before i get to know her , i actually hated her. i really dig this girl , or you could almost say that i ' m( still )in love with her . it seems pretty hard for me to know how i should react to her because of her kind of introverted and bit of obscure nature . intefi we have pretty similar ideas about lots of things and the conversations are fenomenal . still for some reason it seems that it is pretty easy for us to get into argument , because we both really stand out with our own opinions and statements . we both are orally very talented and we are both used to rule the conversations and winning the battles . the reason why it seems that i have trouble of understanding her is that i see how much her inner values and intuitive introversion defects on her opinions . it seems that her opinions are based on inner values and intuitions and the facts( te )are selected on a base on what suits her best . for that she seems bit subjective at all times . this gets me on my toes , because i really value the facts( te )and form my opinions and the big picture( ni )based on them and valuing objective opinions really high . we often seem to get on the same conclusions through different kind of paradigm . we do n ' t have absolutely any problem of understanding the wholeness , besause we both can see the big picture well . it is just that one goes from ni ( fi )te and the other from te ( se )ni . psycological evaluation when our romantic relationship started to go down hill , our debates become more aggressive and she started to blame me for a lots of things . of course that is a logical thing to happen when two people are falling apart from relationship . she really seemed to get inside of my head and made some pretty far going psycological conclusion about me . i think we both value ourselves pretty high and do n ' t cope well with critisism . when she started to blame me for making her feel bad and not appreciating her( which is not true )i tried to argue back and look the situation from more objective site . that did n ' t go well and she blamed me for lack of selfreflection . that might be true , because as an type , i admit that for time to time i have some difficulties about my inner control . she was really demanding and anything i tried to explain her did n ' t make any point . i treid to rationalize how relationship was a compromise of two people and hoe both of us should try to understand each other . dispite of that she always came to conclusion that i should change myself to became what she wants . i think that is beacause on her introversion( fi )and lack of external feeling function that makes it hard for her to understand other people . to be honest i have say that i may suffer from same thing . the way she critisised me was pretty harsh and it actually made me to question myself and kind of crumbled my selfconfidence . that is something that has never happened before . i got really depressed ant it took few months for me to get my game back together . obviuos feelings , still so introvert what comes to her , it was a kind of suprise to me , how unwilling she was talking about her feelings or thoughts , even when i saw that there were something that bothered her . i ' m not blind when comes to sensing other peoples thoughs and way they behave . ofcourse this is natural behaviour of introverted thinker , but because of her strong presence i was able to read her pretty well on that . i tried to make her really open up for me , and i guess i did that pretty aggressive way and when i did n ' t get anything out of her , i kind of did what type' s do and tried to control or manipulate her . that really was the end of everything and i managed to pissed her of . i' ve come clean to her about that and apoligized for my stupid behaviour . how does it go now ? after we broke up , she was kind of hostile towards me . i think that kind of intensive behaviour is normal for type when someone has got close enough to brake the introverted mask . she still blames me for how i made her feel and despite of the fact , that i' ve been her really honest towards her about my own depressions , she still kind of tries to get some revenge on me . i do n ' t think that is nessessarily her goal . i actually see that as an somekind of defensive mechanism towards her own feelings . we still spend time together especially at work and we use a lot of time to discussing about everything . we have kind of agreement about friendship , but the way she acts is not how a friend would act . actually is more of how( bad )girlfiend acts . though she says that i no more mean nothing to her she still sticks her nose up to my things . she also still seems to have really specific ideas about me and how i should behave towards her . i mean this as a positive way . for me it is pretty obvious that she still cares about me or at least has somekind of feelings . i know her well enought to know that she would n ' t spend this much time to something without any meaning . of course when i by a joke try to get her to confess her feelings , she denies it . we have n ' t really had serious conversation . i ' m not even sure would that work on curnt situation . the thing i want to know is can you ladies relate to this and what is your opinion ? i do n ' t know if i need any advices , because i ' m not even sure , what i ' m going to do about her and what i think of her . click to expand."

entj,"hey everyone , new poster here so i apologize if there are threads similar to this one . most entries about type' s state that once their decision is made to break up with a partner , it' s final and there' s no looking back . i just wanted to know what goes on in your heads when it' s over ? especially if you were in a serious relationship and they were your first true love ? from what i understand , type' s tend to not be sentimental and move on fairly quickly ? do you guys ever think about your ex' s and if so what triggers that train of thought( places , songs , dreams , etc. )? how often do you think of them and how long does it take you guys to get over them ? i know it varies from relationship to relationship and why you break up so i guess i' ll add some background as to why i ' m askingmy boyfriend and i had been dating for a year andmonths long distance and i was his first girlfriend . he is fairly religious so he wanted to wait until he met someone really special . at the pinnacle of our relationship he would baby me all the time , talk about our future and how he wanted to take care of mewe' ve met each other' s parents and friends , went on short trips together and would fly to see each other every now and then . we' ve had our fights but in the end we usually took them as signs of growth . it was n ' t until i became really depressed( being far away from my friends and family and all )that things started getting a little messy. . initially we broke up because i became more needy and he told me he did n ' t know how to take care of me anymore . if you are an type and broke up with your girlfriend , have you ever gotten back together with her ? do you guys still have a sweet spot for that extra special someone ? how do you guys move on so well ? i ' m an typetype so i ' m a very sentimental hopeless romantic type of girl."
entj,"i have been wondering , of course types can also show warmth and be empathic and compassionate . but i think it may come across as different ? someone , who says they are an type( though i have no idea if they typed themselves accurately , i do not know them well ), said that they show empathy and compassion without the theaterics of emotions , they just can not be very emotionally expressive but they can still show it . they would look at other people' s emotions with a more critical lens . i imagine that types may not be very expressive , which is why they can come across as coldbut they can also be warmer towards a selective group of people they consider to be close to them . or , you can also be empathic and compassionate without being warm . it just can come across as cold to some people . type and high emotional intelligence would also be a great combination . what do you all think?"

infj,"is anybody here into astrology ? while i see many people typing the capricorn personality as xstj i disagree with this . i believe they best represent the type . capricorns are called old souls . they are considered very wise and have a melancholic aura to them . they are said to be very mature as children and become youthful in spirit as they age . this all sounds type . capricorn would also correlate to enneagram typewhich is one of the most common type enneagram types . many say scorpio would be type but i think scorpio is way too antisocial , erotic and undisciplined to be an type . yes scorpio' s definitely use ni but the amount of paranoia and insanity they exhibit is more characteristic of ni that is in the tertiary or inferior position . scorpio' s are xstp' s in my opinion . capricorns are said to be very compatible with scorpios . could this be the xnfjxstp shadow dynamic at work ? half the descriptions i read make capricorns out to be these hard headed ceo' s which sounds stj but those descriptions are too superficial . the following gives more insight into a cap and sounds very type especially in the bolded places many astrologers consider capricorn to be the most enigmatic and mysterious sign of the zodiac . all of the cardinal signs indicate seats of power and in a creature with the forelimbs of a goat attached to the tail of a fish , the abyss of the ocean is combined with mountainous terrain . this represents a' cross of matter 'between the psyche and its manifestation in the material , drawing the soul out of its collective stupor to confront the challenges of reality and individualism . the ocean , besides symbolizing primordial roots , relates to instinctive wisdom , secrets , and knowledge that lies buried within the depths of consciousness . capricorn , bearing only the tail of an aquatic creature , keeps a head that is free from impressionable thoughtat a rational level capricorns are affected only by what they can define through logic and reasoned assessment , but unconsciously , spiritually and emotionally they draw from the deep . this is a sign that is anything but shallow and superficial beneath the capricorn' s cool , reserved and calculating exterior lies a profound resource of emotional strength , psychic resilience and earthy endurance . the recognizable character traits of the sign reveal compulsion , dedication and perseverance in its aims and interests . capricorns may not impress others by their motivation but neither do they seek the easy approval or widespread attention of others . their ambitionsin relationships , career and personal growthare rooted in an' inner 'motivation that runs too deep to be easily shaken . their strengths( and their faults )are based upon the qualities of stamina , fortitude , staying power and survival . some see the capricorn' s scaly tail as that of the seaserpent , a creature of' old knowledge ', wise in matters of the occult and offering a potential for understanding beyond limited , earthly experience . capricorns are known for being' older than their years 'and those who take up the study of mysteries and traditions gravitate towards a masterly knowledge of their craft just as the business minded capricorn will gravitate towards the managerial position . mastery and power are the understated keywords of this sign . even the earthy aspect of the goat is frequently underestimated in its potential for symbolising hidden reserves of strength . click to expand."
