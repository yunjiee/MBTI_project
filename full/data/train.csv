entp,i mean   really   what did you expect    happy i  ve noticed that there are a lot of ask a a question threads in the other forums   but nobody seems to want to ask an <type> a question that  s probably because you know you  re unlikely to get a serious or useful answer so now you can ask an <type> a question   with the full understanding that whatever you get as a response will be witty   sarcastic and less than totally accurate and   you know   somebody might actually give you a valid answer if they feel like it 
estj,hello <type>s   in this interview   i got a chance to discuss extroverted intuition   introverted sensing   extroverted thinking   and introverted sensing with all the types that have this function stack    <type>   <type>   <type>   and <type>    in this interview   we had natacha    <type>      annie    <type>      cinzia    <type> jumper      heather    <type>      nina    <type> jumper      and hannah    <type> jumper    share their stories and struggles in regards to the functions they are good at and the ones they have troubles with one of my favourite takeaways from this interview is how <type>s will use objects to get rid of emotions because feelings are scary <type>s will also use objects to alleviate negative emotions since they have si above fi however   because they are n t scared of people since they are a double decider   then they wo n t have problems asking for help from a therapist or friend family to help them process those feelings another interesting take away is that <type>s and <type>s have a tendency to have foreboding joy and if they are too happy   they feel like something bad is going to happen right around the corner nina for example talked about seeing hedgehogs and think they are so cute and she is overwhelmed with positive emotions however   she also starts thinking about how the cute hedgehog will die and how bad she will feel if she sees it pass away with the <type>s and <type>s   they have fi above si regardless of whether it is a demon or saviour   as a result   they feel more comfortable processing the negative emotions however   because <type>s and <type>s have fi above si   having a steady health routine    healthy eating   exercise   sleep    is the bigger struggle for <type>s   it seems that they put pressure on themselves to build up that si routine for <type>s   some will need to recruit help to hold them accountable    ne te  s    or put pressure on themselves if they have saviour consume and sleep watch this interview here

istj,hello i recently got a book from our library about analyzing handwriting   and wanted to share a description i found accurate for myself a special situation called secondary expansion is where the letters themselves are narrow but the spaces in between them are wide on the surface the writer appears to be outgoing   but inside she shrinks away from social contact yet despite her insecurity and shyness   she pushes herself to interact   at least in groups where she knows the people we call this type of person a converted introvert because while it is n t natural to her   she  s learned how to behave as an extrovert in social situations the complete idiot  s guide to handwriting analysis   second edition sheila lowe i find this extremely interesting because that description is pretty close to the way i behave in school   and matches my handwriting style almost perfectly if you do n t mind   a description of your handwriting and type would be pretty sweet to see if handwriting analysis is basically accurate thank you   
istp,do <type>s ever enjoy abstract conversations    i  ve been married to an <type> for a relatively long time and i m slowly starting to believe i m never going to be content with his mental abilities i do n t meet other people that often and i m hoping to get some perspective in this   because i can no longer say if i m being unreasonable or if my husband really is a little bit thick is some way an example of our conversation could go something like this me do you believe in god    he no   of course not   it would be stupid me but you have told me that you sometimes pray when you are afraid he yeah   that  s true then his mind turns elsewhere and there  s a long pause me so   do you believe in god or not    he no me why    he because it  s stupid another    imaginary but true enough    example me i had a dream about x trying to harm me he what happened    me tells i wonder why i always dream about that thing it must have something to do with x he pets my head me so what do you think    he must feel bad to have those dreams me not really   they are just dreams what do you think about my theory    he i think you should find some solution so that you no longer have to worry about x me ok   but what about the theory    he hmmm long pause he do you think we should do b today    me the dream   he oh right   would n t it be cool if x could freeze his disk and use it like a hammer    he seems to be unable to deal with abstract opinions or thoughts in the latter example he thinks i need emotional comfort so he tries to solve that by petting me he sucks at empathy so i hardly ever expect anything from him on that part anyway   and i rarely want to talk about my feelings instead i see an interesting phenomenon that could be discussed on general level i  ve told him all this a thousand times but he always behaves the same way i  ve even tried to state beforehand that i am now theorizing   not seeking empathy it does n t help so   is abstract discussion something <type>s ca n t generally get at all    are there any tricks that could help me get him open up about his thoughts    he says he would like to be able to have good conversations with me but he has n t put any effort into learning how 
istj,hello <type>s   in this interview   i got a chance to talk to jamie and cherie about their similarities and differences as a standard and jumper <type> type for context   the jumper <type> type simply jumps over the te and becomes si and fi first as oppose to si and te we started the interview with cherie and jamie talking about their observer problems with their phones then   we jumped into the topic of talking about the feeling of disrespected for the standard <type> and getting tribe hate from the jumper <type> cherie and jamie started making fun of me and said that all nt  s like wearing cardigan and it  s a nerd thing    looks like i  ll have to start wearing my cardigan on some interviews    this interview was actually really funny   with the <type>s observer problems   making fun of self and tribe   and their weirdness with consuming new information during our discussion about consuming new information   both jamie and cherie said they get really weird about consuming new information they said all they want is to consume what they  ve already seen but they  re not allowed because that  s cheating and you need to consume something new we also started talking about being a double decider and funny enough we started both praising and making fun of ixxp types    double deciders have to be balanced with praising and making fun of otherwise   it becomes weird    it  s all in good fun of course because we like ixxps as friends cherie and jamie also started talking about their masculine ne and how their predictions tend to be wrong they said they feel confident about it because it  s masculine but because it  s a demon   they do n t feel responsible for making sure their prediction is right finally   we talked about the fi si identity and how it  s not good to tie the identity to your role or job instead   you need to look at your role or job and see if they tick all the boxes in your top   values if it ticks all the boxes then it  s the right job for you and if not then continue the search watch this interview here 
isfj,do you like watching movies   <type>s    yesterday i watched odd thomas and i found it very interesting i think thomas has some characters of <type> like batman in batman series the film is about the good and the bad with mixed events which could guide the audiences to follow the main actors misleading thoughts this film has a lot of emotional and thrilling materials that touch my senses overall   the movie has decent actors actresses and astonishing end    except some violent and scary scenes which you might be afraid of and   predictable culprit    my judgment     
infj,so we  ve done some <type> videos and had a thread on <type> eyes lets see if there is a trend in appearance of <type>s in photos because we all know that a picture is worth a thousand words wink playing around with my macbook with an sj friend no makeup a few weeks ago when i went to starbucks after work 
estp,ok   simply speaking it would be <type>   however all of the <type>s i know do not feel like my opposite at all i clash most   or shall i say i feel most opposite with <type> which personality would you say you think most opposite to you    why would you consider this personality as the opposite    
enfj,i think everyone will agree   that we as <type>  s tend to fall in love or get emotionally attached to people very quickly a question which has been boggling my mind lately is why    is it because of the seemingly neverending energy we have   which when focused on one single person makes our emotions flourish and rapidly amplifies them   thus making us quickly fall for the other person    is it because we are so people focused and so in touch with them   that we can feel someone instantly and connect with them on a very deep emotional level without needing the proper time to get to know them    or is it because no matter how rational we try to be and block ourselves off from feeling intense emotions   deep down inside it is what makes us feel alive    we want so much to feel something   that more often than other types   we go with our hearts even when our minds are saying no    for me   if i let go of my rational side   i can fall for someone in a matter of days or weeks    it  s shocking i know    most of the time i can control my emotions as not to become clingy and just be happy without wanting more other times   i can totally and utterly fall and my emotions take control of me that  s when i get hurt and end up feeling all the negative stuff am curious to hear other people  s opinions
entp,i m <type> the <type>s i  ve encountered seem very exuberant   but after knowing them    only a couple of women    i get the feeling they are less willing to be in contact with their emotions is this understanding correct    it seems confusing to me because i would associate their exuberance with emotions 
intj,so i found this in the <type> section and thought it would be useful for my fellow <type>s courtesy of nova take issue with something going on in society    having a bad day    have something on your mind that wont go away    experience something so fabulous you just have to express it    post your vent here   and a friendly reminder to please be respectful to other members and leave your baggage at the door 
intj,i do n t remember the source but here are some numbers other personality traits being the same   an intuitive person    one who grasps patterns and seeks possibilities    is    times more likely to have a higher iq than a sensing person    one who focuses on sensory details and the here and now    again   other traits being the same   an introverted person is   times more likely to have a higher iq than one who is extraverted a thinking    logic oriented    person is     times more likely to have a higher iq than a feeling    people oriented    person and a judging person    one who seeks closure    is about twice as likely to have a higher iq than a perceiving person    one who likes to keep his options open    moreover   if you encounter an <type>    introverted   intuitive   thinking   judging      there is a    probability that his iq places him in the top   percent of the population    about   out of       the probability is    for an <type>      for an <type>   and   for an <type> these four types account for    of the high iq population but only   of the total population click to expand this does n t make me think i m superior it makes me feel sad what do you think    
intj,post about new technologies or inventions we could be looking forward to within the next five years

isfj,hey there   i would like to know your <type>s take on this you may judge me for the infidelity part i do n t get this <type>      m    he  s been with his first girlfriend    long distance    for over    years we started having casual sex about   monthes ago he made the first step we started texting a lot   were seeing each other once or twice a week cuddling and talking afterwards we starting meeting for a walk or lunch just as often well i fell in love and to me it feels like he is   too he is very private about his relationship and reluctant to talk about it no matter to whom only when i repeatedly asked weither he was happy with his girlfriend he said yes another time when i tried to talk openly he told me straight away i do n t want to start a relationship with you i am already in a relationship as far as i know he has been cheating on his girlfriend quiet a few times it started when he fell in love with another girl who was making an effort to seduce him a couple of years ago that girl told me he wanted to leave his girlfriend but when she came round   he had fallen out of love he confessed that he did not have sex with his girlfriend since we started having sex it seems that she is never been much interested in sex which is a pitty   because he is a very gifted lover who enjoys sex and intimacy beyond measure he is just as unwilling to talk about how we feel for each other he shows me in many ways that he cares he avoided phrasing it as beeing in love with me but   actually   that is what i m guessing    or hoping       he did mention casualy   however   how he told a friend he was besotted with me he is very appreciative and caring he said he enjoys working with me he compliments me a lot on my body just as much as my personality    he says stuff like how can one person be this wonderfull       when we ca n t see each other   he texts me that he misses me before we meet    even for work    he will text that he is locking forward to it we are secretly holding hands under the table    e g in a bar with freinds    well   and we just ca n t take our hand of each other when i told him i would like to see him more often   he said i was pushing an open door but when i said i wanted more   he backed off he tries to make it sound like we have a great friendship every time i told him that i do n t want to be just friends he told me with tears in his eyes that he did n t want me to leave the grown up in me knows that this guy is not willing to leave his girlfriend   that i should not try to interfere any more and that this is a stupid place to start a realitionship anyway but being realistic is not my strength and the dreamy romantic part of me just wants to be with him because this feels amazing because i know how relunctant he is about big changes i feel stupid and naive but then again i felt like that every single time i fell in love i appreaciate any reply thank you so much for your time      i feel better just be writing this down    
enfp,it seems that you can tell someone  s type by their eyes    not sure if that  s true   but i found it interesting i  ll post if someone else does first blushed    sorry if this thread already exists    
esfj,like the title says seems like most other types have a sticky thread like this   so thought it was time we get one started here too 
isfp,i remember reading that <type>  s are often very competitive that was one of the few things that did n t make sense to me but then i thought about my childhood i remember losing more than winning i remember it really bothering me too it  s not like the desire to win was n t there i remember in sports i always had plenty of strength   speed   and endurance   more than most the problem was that i have poor coordination   and i have a slow reaction time so anyways   i think i just got sick of caring and being butthurt about losing    not just in sports    so i fell asleep well   almost i still feel the remnants of my lame <type> competitiveness but then that  s when i basically in my subconscious realize but oh yeah   i m not gonna do a damn thing about this so i  ll just forget about it now snore do any other <type>  s here feel uncompetitive mostly    does anyone know uncompetitive <type>  s    did you they get that way in a similar way as i did    
isfp,as an <type>   i know an <type> that is just super flightly   more to do with who they are and not so much their type but they are so conflict adverse and scretive that it gets annoying even talking to them anyway one is mad at me now for thinking i did something i did n t do   and i wonder how they handle anger i  ve read it  s somewhat ragey   like a teenage temper tantrum and that according to the   sides of the mind   they tend to rely on other  s opinion and advice while in difficult situations is that relatable to you    
estj,<type>s can cheat often in life because for success    
esfp,i think i might be an <type> because i m highly impulsive and never think of the consequences of my actions   yet i m quite introverted i do n t like most people    in fact i m very selective with who i spend my time with due to being an sx dom    and i have misanthropic tendencies i have few friends it could just be my autism   but can an <type> be autistic as well    
estj,how would i do this    winning the argument itself with facts is not a problem the problem is to get them to acknowledge defeat and stop trying to use transference with logical fallacies and ambiguous phrasing my step dad is <type> and we get into petty arguments a lot when i prove him wrong he will respond with one of several things total silence as if the argument never occurred eventually he might say i do n t have time to talk about this right now   repetition of something that asserts his position of power over me    ex it  s my house        or repetition of his original position which has been defeated a logical fallacy   usually a straw man or ad hominem he also has this way of phrasing statements as questions so that my only possible response can be in answer form   not counter argument form it is very hard to explain so i will just save it basically   what is the most effective way of getting an arrogant <type> to realize and admit they are wrong    i need tactics   strategies what has worked on you in the past       this is assuming there are   ironically   <type> using internet forums    
estp,hello <type>s   i am an <type> and i have found myself dating my <type> best friend we  ve been best friends for years   and always had a mutual attraction   but one of us was always taken my partner is very much an <type> with one quirk being that he  s learned when to shut his mouth and not offend people as much as some <type>s i m very much an <type> deep inside but with some <type> nudging i become quite sociable and adventurous   and thanks to my ex i  ve learned to become much softer   more sympathetic and learned a lot from feelers my n and j are quite strong    which meant when we first met   his dominant se and my ni made it a struggle for us to communicate   learning to communicate with him taught me a lot    i know my friend well though he  s never had a relationship last longer than   years he has great intentions   and genuinely believes it is heading towards marriage   but he gets bored and can quite coldly cut it off one of the    many    reasons he  s attracted to me is that we go on lots of adventures i know that adventure is important    and that is never going to change    but what else can i do to keep an <type> interested in the long term    i m secretly scared that once sex touch becomes the norm he  ll get bored and look around for something new 
entp,i know this looks long but i was saving from people having to click a bunch of links to articles and boiled it down instead desthro brought up an article about adhd with regard to my organizing things that interest me but neglecting forgetting about every day organization as i read the article   it made me really think about how much adhd symptoms are so similar to <type> personality traits    usually described as our weaknesses      how can you tell what is a disease and what is having ne ti in the front positions i have never been officially diagnosed but i suspect i might be adhd however   i have always been able to use life hacks to function pretty well   even as a child i am forgetful disorganized but very responsible    probably more responsible than most <type>s    and my inability to sit still has usually been used for good rather than evil    helping other people rather than just disrupting    really though   am i adhd or an <type> with high ne    anyway   here is a list of adhd symptoms vs <type> traits adhd lack of focus possibly the most telltale sign of adhd   lack of focus goes beyond trouble paying attention it means being easily distracted   finding it hard to listen to others in a conversation   overlooking details   and not completing tasks or projects the flip side to that is hyperfocus    see below    hyperfocus while people with adhd are often easily distractible   they may also have something called hyperfocus a person with adhd can get so engrossed in something that they can become unaware of anything else around them this kind of focus makes it easier to lose track of time and ignore those around you this can lead to relationship misunderstandings disorganization life can seem chaotic for everyone at times   but someone with adhd typically has a more hectic life experience on a regular basis this can make it difficult to keep everything in its right place an adult with adhd may struggle with these organizational skills this can include problems keeping track of tasks and trouble prioritizing them in a logical manner time management problems this issue goes hand in hand with disorganization adults with adhd often have trouble using their time effectively they may procrastinate on important tasks   show up late for important events   or ignore assignments they consider boring they may have trouble focusing on the future or the past the now is often more top of mind for them forgetfulness it s human to forget things occasionally   but for someone with adhd   forgetfulness is a part of everyday life this can include routinely forgetting where you ve put something or what important dates you need to keep impulsivity impulsiveness in someone with adhd can manifest in several ways interrupting others during conversation being socially inappropriate rushing through tasks acting without much consideration to the consequences lack of motivation while you might be open to doing everything at once   you also may feel unmotivated coupled with procrastination and poor organizational skills   this problem can make it difficult for an adult with adhd to finish a project because they can t focus for long periods of time restlessness and anxiety as an adult with adhd   you may feel like your motor won t shut off your yearning to keep moving and doing things can lead to frustration when you can t do something immediately this leads to restlessness   which can lead to frustration and anxiety <type>s   they love change <type>s are always looking for something new and gets bored with routine and having possessions with them for a long time once something else comes along   they get distracted this is also evident in the way they handle relationships that they tend to hop from one relationship to another   they easily get bored with people and things when they feel a friend is not able to help them in a positive way or is not being a good influence   they are open to letting go and move forward moreover   despite their being innovators   once they lose interest on what they do   they end up leaving them unfinished   they are risk takers this can be a weakness at times for <type>s since they often do things without thinking twice of the outcome these can include financial risks like starting businesses because they find them interesting at first   they love arguments <type>s enjoy asking questions and asking the views of other people that it often ends up in a debate simply because they want to understand things and look at a situation from different perspectives   other people see them as confrontational   making big things out of trivial matters this can affect their relationships with other people what s ironic is that they only want to understand things more clearly   they have the tendency to have unfinished jobs the faster <type>s get excited with new things that interest them   the faster they lose their passion on them when things begin to be a routine when they are not happy with what they do   they lose the drive to stay on it and will want to leave and do something else   an <type> may show some a lack of sensitivity to the feelings and ways of those who might need reassurance   security or commitment for those of you that have been officially diagnosed   how is adhd different than just being an <type>    
esfp,hello <type>s   in this video   i talked to benjamin about what it  s like to be an <type> se fi cp b    s    ff benjamin talked about his life as an <type> and having trouble using his ni properly to make life decisions instead   he gets stuck channel changing multiple times which actually hurt him benjamin talked about changing majors while going to school which hurt him badly because of mounting student loans without completing any degrees or diplomas eventually   benjamin joined the military which i think gave his life some stability benjamin also talked about his masculine ni and how if he makes a long term decision   it feels like it  s set   that it cannot be moved we discussed how because he is an exxp   he can pivot if that life decision does n t pan out which should n t be the most difficult thing for him we also talked about the exxp addiction to gathering which we both shared and how it  s important to budget in gathering new experience money and not going over that budget that way   we can keep the gathering addiction monster at bay while we work on being more disciplined finally   we talked about tester and visual and benjamin talked about his obsession with smelling things first hand just to find out what they really smell like watch this interview here 
infj,it will be a bit long again the default of the professionalized betrayal   from one to one   it was never believed really for what it was   places members of the lost upper middle class into the hands of autonomous physical welfare of what then was never for sure their problem to govern    it just is n t    they confuse hobbying and leveling the high ground   when generally close to exceptional individuals in their symbolic attributes coming from lower middle class environments which grew into a truer period of depopularization of academic benches all came to them as better inquisitive ground for better employment of their life force to be able to learn by living through the societal judgements towards the specifying of love relationships for example   or worklife   ancestral entrepreneurship   group law making   blunt stochastization of income and outcome poverty   to oppose with the greatest care to   well   what could simply be less inclined to make such people in turn what these people learnt from   primarily   by the default itself of its requirement   was themselves first   and the rest followed whatever which is now physicalize in the very practice of their academically learnt decisions   en coulisse arguments   negatiotated pre delegations   professional forcings   amiable compromises and given returns   indeed   was rightfully to never be physical environments are by themselves obligatorily aculturally driven they are there to serve the mental welfare in the cultural sense   outside of reaching systems of what jean jacques rousseau called obligation to oppose to necessity imaginary against felicitative as to what is a society of men coming from the separated conjunction of these two categories they are really what is the closer to culture is deemed to be by the people themselves   that of which the desacralized actual upper middle class opposes its notion of diversity through moving themselves outside of more popular cultural learnings   preaches and functions through boredom in the sole hope of regaining the upper hand over whatever permitted the arising of these good misses and gentlemen   come to invest more and more the trust towards acultural methods of popular   strictly mental i dare say   more worldly   felicitative mode of being under that notion they in all   refuse obligation   that on which they cut short by specializing themselves in newly sought positions of leadership for roles which do n t need them   they preach more and more the trend of usable insanity to react to any pushes for unstable   so called deviant mentality in fact more really a search for cultural abundance   that which almost never answers so well for whomever in turn would respond better in the here to of precedent work she misses one category then lands there   which in his own right   is wholefully physical   trully    revocably    organized culturally   and an other is sadly more atuned to work at their expense at an acultural rythm as an organism of results of which   well   the first would in turn answer much more well and freely so from an unrevendicated pro social autist    little clarifying note of the aspect these organisms would be the same or they would be not    
esfj,when an <type> goes in the grip from being overloaded at work   and becomes closed up and stops communicating with a best friend   do they still think about that friend with the same frequency    do they miss that friend in the same way like they would have if they were n t stressed out    after they return back to normal   do they usually wish to resume the friendship just like it was before    do they feel regret for distancing so much from that friend when they were stressed out    
infj,i m not old   i m young or the contrary   reinforcing is it possible not to    meaning   on a personal level   i have persuaded myself   not answering the first question by the second there   that truth in bypassing the product of emotion as it does n t seem to be related anymore to the true feeling of truth as a compass of discussion outside of it   by that   is what i  ve resumed in not liking it anymore   as in this actual form it does to me reciprocally this reverse is not accepted anymore by people who talk truth   since by compareason they resumed themselves in liking it while in the first place i know for sure i never ever did from anywhere it comes truth is becoming to me like a self harassment object    and you got me   its contrary      which paradoxically   if it has not been thought of outside of its truthful acceptability   let  s call it really for what it is unability to feel the good in doing to be safely seen by accepting the feeling itself of its existence   of what it means really and not not really   killing that false safety and giving paradoxically its inexistence to the good is not accepted anymore as a project like   somewhat   thought is in the history of human existence   a heretic one really   only that   accusating the oh so inferior inventive instinct of emotion which is just our very modal existence i believe so yeah   like repent in all sort of expressions before being somewhat killed by the oh so universal truthful discussion   just always so freakin  tiring   just because the emotion itself is just never believed to lead to a somewhat more truthful i have to say emotional truth i believe life applies on life   as it means there that our existence is not composed of our most truthful expressions but by coming first to our own emotional presence on which we do n t repent   but by which we redempt by wanting to see   we do n t and so on why do we have to construct the image of wanting to see in favor of not   just there   the image of personal   past   but against real human invention   repentence    falsely past   because invention itself has two lives those are not those we want   it  s a lie   one of those people   mainly and trully high thinking types who see intentional superiority in seeing the all kind truth as an inventive mask because the fact is that they do n t want themselves to link old and young in human marketability that  s what they do n t want invention that does n t want itself   and not the contrary to exactly that i  d call that moreso like a loss of present future   period following but maybe it  s just an affair of being a pro social autist    burk    i do n t think so people who do n t really like truth in all kinds   those ones   can come finally much closer to those in turn who do n t anymore   like me generally speaking <type>s with their inferior se i think can adopt the ni se    which i imagine is a very difficult thing to achieve and is wholly part of the deseeded soil subject there    shift by discussing that i think   even if i think personally that it comes from it   assuming you got me   that it comes from <type>s  s only because of their inferior ti just that edit the perfectibility of expressions pushes us towards repentence    false    and so on i profoundly dislike the truths that others do n t know of and so on   again how can people make sense into not making sense    they repent and likely otherwise they redempt themselves my main inspiration for this claim as i can recognize it in all ends is contained    or not    in the philosophy of philipp mainlander   mainly i mean   he  s like the only ace in the hole of philosophy    western    i can think of   aside machiavelli second    which would be more eastern i only dare guessing    
enfp,think about what he  s done he was good at organizing he was a charmeur   in fact he was a womanizer    now   i was not expecting this    he was not good in math   in fact he sucked at math   but he was good at poetry or literature he was almost more a politican than a phisicyst he made something believable what everyone thought was not possible now what is ne if not that    overall i think oppenheimer was an <type> his enthusiasm won him over when he realized he could create something what others could n t   but ultimately he realized what he  s done and he called for supervision i think it fits the <type> profile more than anything btw i think teller was <type>
enfp,i stole this idea from jawz over in the <type> forum      i thought it might be cool to see how many people of different enneatypes we have here so i  ll start   and then the next person to post   copy and paste the list from the person above you and add yourself hopefully at the end we  ll have a super long list   i know not everybody knows their tritype   so you can just put your primary type and wing    i e  w     if you do n t know   but feel free to list your tritype and stacking if you know it viva  w   w   w  so sx
istp,i did n t see a similar thread in our forum so i guess this is stolen from the other type  s forums it  s pretty self explanatory   so go ahead ask 
istj,out of these types series   which do you prefer and why    if other   state what that might be 
istp,<type>s and <type>s stupid    brilliant    makes zero sense    or it works    
entp,have a read of this website discussion on whether <type>  s actually have introverted tendancies   personalitydoor com the introverted <type>s i suspect this interpretation reflects the four temperaments rather than the sixteen types    or perhaps a slight variation to the temperaments    np nj st sf i can see how np can reflect some introverted tendancies in the <type> for example    also   does this concept work for other types    can an <type> exhibit extraverted tendancies    opinions    
istj,i have a <type>    scorpio    guy friend he got a gf this past october it ll be   year this oct we had a past together   and it was intimate we remained friends as he wanted to even when they started to date i told him i wouldn t interfere and he said i wouldn t   and she is welcoming of friends and to keep them we don t talk now    it s been a month and he has ignored all my texts i ve apologized   and kept my texts friendly   so i m not sure what happened
estp,i m opening up this thread for those of you non <type>s who feel the need to create threads to bash the entire <type> type because of your preconceived notions of what an <type> is are will be we have plenty of these threads but i might as well make this to save you all the trouble of making your own thread feel free to complain but i do n t think most of the <type>s will care go ahead and knock yourself out   literally and figuratively

isfj,hello   i am an <type> female   seeking advice on an <type> relationship so recently i met an <type> who really liked me he pursued me and after a while   i liked him back we went out and he even forced a kiss on me after that   he became kinda weird he still texted me daily   but he is reluctant to hang out   citing that he did n t want anything to happen he says we should just let nature takes its course when it comes to our relationship and he told me to reconsider it carefully because of the many obstacles we have    cultures   nationality   education   income    even his way of texting has changed like he became more passive and less involved he also seems reluctant to tell me personal information which he used to share however   there was this incident that just happened where i was sick and he rushed down to take me home so i reckon that he still likes me i just dunno what to do from here on is there a way to change the whole relationship dynamics again    or what should i do    
infj,i thought this would be a fun discussion to see what people say what are some clear signs that you  re an <type>       
istp,from what i  ve read   <type>s can sometimes suddenly act cold or be mean in order to test if the person can keep up with their quirks or that they  ll really stay i was wondering if <type>s ever do this as well i m still parsing through what happened with my relationship with my <type> ex and he went hot cold   jerkoff upstanding gentleman and back again a couple times it seemed the super cold and the super hot would both be sudden i e please do n t go   you  re the best to get out   i do n t have feelings from you and even months later i m like what    also   do <type>s think about old relationships at all    i resent the idea that i still think about it while he bounces around happily

estp,hi   at this point after lots and lots of thought   i have come to the conclusion that i m a se dom but problem is   i certainly do not relate to the ni inferior i can tell people  s intentions   certain hidden meanings   can recognize patterns with a lot of ease and can also tell    not a     accurately but can    people  s possible next moves and where things probably are headed i m not an ni dom for sure since my accuracy is far from the accuracy of a ni dom or aux but it  s also very far away from a ni inf just wanted to know y all  s opinion on this does this seem possible       is there any explanation for this or am i simply mistyped

esfp,just need some perspective my coworker at my new job is an <type>      f    and she happened to train me      f    on my first day we actually had a lot in common and she was so helpful and i could tell she genuinely wanted to make me comfortable me being overly sensitive shy   i anticipated my first day being stressful and she always assures me to not overthink things she s been there for every mistake i made   and tries to make me feel better after each time i thought she was cute   the second i saw her but didn t think she liked girls so i wasn t pursuing the same day   i heard her checking out and complimenting someone s girlfriend   freely still i fell back because i was the new girl and didn t wanna seem distracted or overbearing she was surprised i was    and told me that i carried myself well so i wanted to keep that calm demeanor i knew i had a crush but wanted to tone it down because i felt a pressure at work and would make many mistakes and just feel anxious and overthink the entire time she knows i m shy and sometimes i felt hurt whenever she doesn t initiate convos and talks to others i don t initiate and i feel jealous when others spend a long time with her because she is so social also sometimes she purposely ignores me      i ve seen her do this to others    i think she does this when stressed or feels controlled i want to see this <type> as a friend bc she is the closest co worker i have   and the most understanding of my personality my feelings get hurt often and don t want it to hurt my friendship bc i need friends at work lol and she s great i do think she s attracted to me because ever since training she became touchy feely    she regularly would play with my hair   place her hand on my back or try to touch hands or arms    this basically happens every shift we are together   i am very aware of body language and notice she always tries to get closer to me i don t initiate physical touch but she always comes to the host stand leans over on her phone   and will stay there touching my arm    she ll stop if i don t reciprocate    l also i catch her staring at me sometimes bc i am always in a daze looking at nothing but can feel when someone is looking at me she s called me every pet name i think she s most positive towards me she also shows me she cares she reiterates my bday or facts about me    if relevant to convo    she splits easy tasks with me so i won t be bored and can hang out w her she over communicates   directly and honestly asking me why i don t talk   initiate convos or socialize with others she says we re different and that s ok times i have been off putting to her    trying to protect my feelings    she still tries to talk and then i feel bad i ve grown attached bc she s made an strong effort to get to know and befriend me now i can t get over the flirtatiousness for a fact   she knows i like her i ve acted too clumsy too nervous far too many times anyone with a brain could tell but she played on it or teased me   instead or being annoyed or awkward it was always entertaining to her i love that she cares about me but i hate that she is not     aware of my feelings while flirting with me it s like she s there one second and then she s gone i think she enjoys the attention while enjoying the friendship because it s not like i m starting the flirtation shes verbatim told me i am trying to get a reaction out of you    referring to playing w my hair    thought on my conclusion    like i said   i really think she s a good person but cannot stand the thought of my feelings as her entertainment whether she likes me or not i don t fully blame her   she probably thinks i don t take the feelings i try to hide seriously and that i enjoy the flirting as much as her honestly it s a painfully redundant cycle
esfp,i do n t know about you guys but after extensive reading about add i can high relate to it and i m wondering if it  s common among <type>s or just a personality thing i m constantly doing things   i m impatient   when a task or topic becomes boring i drop it and do some i enjoy   i m horrible with school work that i find unnecessary and unhelpful and i end up not doing it i use to get as and bs during my fresh soph year in high school   and now my junior year approached i have cs notably in my ap classes thoughts    btw if you  re curious about why i m labeled as an <type>   it  s because the first few times i  ve taken the test   i  ve tested as <type> the third time   i was an <type>   and other <type>s on this forum has observed me as someone who uses my feelings in consideration 
istj,i ve been in sexual relationship with a guy since      i think he s still attracted to me because he opens my pictures quite a few times when i send him about   months ago   he told me he s back together with his ex   and i don t know if it s his ex wife or girlfriend   and i still don t know if they are together as this is long distance i bought a plane ticket to see him next week because it seemed apparent he was with someone when he was with me and is pretty open flexible i m at loss about what to do it s hard for me to want to be in a relationship with anyone because i ve seen too much cheating in my life however   it s been a year since i ve seen him   and there s this void i miss going over there and i have all this lingerie i haven t worn and don t want to throw away i don t ever think i can find anyone who will do it for me like he did or has made me feel so wanted before it s hard for me to want to be in a relationship with anyone because i ve seen too much cheating in my life however   it s been a year since i ve seen him   and there s this void i miss going over there and i have all this lingerie i haven t worn and don t want to throw away i don t ever think i can find anyone who has ever made me feel so wanted before    i ve only had one friend and she lives out of state    i wanted to ask an <type> this because i am an <type>   and there were characters in movies i could really relate to when they were dealing with grief before i discovered my type   i could relate to a lot of characters in movies that i found out were <type> i wanted to ask an <type> this because i am an <type> before i learned type   i identified with many characters in movies deal with grief in the same way as i do   and they seem to be typed as <type> the older guy in up who continues to sit on his chair because he can t get over the death of his wife the king at the end of lord of the rings return of the king who sits there and feasts on tomatoes because he doesn t know how to move past the loss of his son and impending destruction of the kingdom the captain of the titanic who literally can t function after they hit the iceberg    my ability to use te has gone out the window    the guy who hides the family in the quiet place who still continues to look at photos of his wife and internalizes everything basically   i could relate to a lot of these characters before i knew type i don t think i can ever move on there s just too many memories   but i don t like feeling like this it s been so hard and i ll randomly start crying in front of people   and i can t focus    i ve spent over   hours trying to draft this    i don t care about money   can t remember anything and couldn t function and had to leave work because i can t guide myself through i don t want it to be like those movie examples anyone been in a situation where they were able to deal with a loss effectively    i only have one close friend   and she s out of state   and i haven t been talking to her much because this has been on my mind too much 
infj,are there any christian <type>s here   and if so   what has been your experience    how did you end up following jesus    and what is the thing you tend to struggle with more than anything else    
enfj,hi all   its been awhile since i  ve been here i  ve recently been diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and it made me think could it be quite possible that most <type>s have adhd    samething as add just a newer term    because here  s the thing if you have adhd or you  re an <type> you probably      have trouble listening    but a great listener   but likes to cut to the chase since we have a natural tendency to understand others quickly and on a whim    to others and prefer having to be the speaker    being a mentor and all         impulsivity    randomly jumpy   and just random in general    commit to something and go oh crap later on being hyper as a means to get attention and for the sake of elevating the tone and mood      always on the go or being all over the place or function as though being run by a motor      easily distracted      sensitive to criticism      always being told that you  re either weird or just really out there i just thought there might be some kind of correlation 
isfp,did this for the <type>s   now i m going to try ask here why so little youtube vids    i get it shy   blahblahblah   but i m trying to analyze the body language portrayed by certain types   and there are hardly any <type> videos ehm   so   why not make some    pretty pleeeeeeeeeeeease   with sugar on top 
enfp,paradox of me i believe in   dignity   character   virtue   and conviction i believe that   kindness can be your strenght   creativity can be made real   making values into rules of laws justice is my core   tight rein on my intuition   running inside me   as my very source of essence when the times comes   i will do whatever it takes   i will set the wrong right   leading a rebellion violence hurts me   evil offends me   i can either choose   not to see it   or feel the weight of it i am soft marshmallow   clad in the strongest armour   filled with verocity and conviction i am kind but dangerous   i am affectionate but hard core   free   yet self discipline when i am angry   get out of my way   i will be your deadly natural disaster if you are lucky   i will find reason to forgive you   that  s the paradox of me nikisan          
esfj,please try not to go all fe and say i would get along with any healthy type be brutally honest <type>s   you are given so much hate on these forums   which type is not your type    and why    
istj,hello <type>s     i was hoping some of you could give me some advice i am an <type> who after having broken up with a controlling and boundary pushing ex two months previous i went on a blind date    my first      with an <type>    who has had very bad luck dating    through a mutual friend at first i found him a bit robotic and very shy   he would n t take the lead on many conversations   regardless i asked him out on a second date at which point i said i feel a spark   but i do n t think it  s all the way there   sorry   but in hindsight i was searching for the wrong traits fast forward a few months and we  ve stayed in contact and the more i get to know him the more we get on really well   i had always valued his sense of duty   reliability   good work ethic and honesty and now he was coming out of his shell i liked him more and more we decided to meet up again last week and had a lovely time out and then went back to mine to watch some films he then started making a move on me   we do n t have sex but done everything in between which i was not expecting   i wanted to tell him how i felt but thought it best to let things sink in and tell him next time i see him which would of been later this week during the weekend though he texts me saying  i  ve been thinking about the other night   i do n t think it should happen again and we should stay friendly sorry i m not in the right frame of mind  i explained to him that that  s okay and i m here if he wants to go into specifics and talk about things   i told him i was going to tell him later on in the week that i did see us more than friends and that at first i could n t make sense of my feelings but i have now and i think we are compatible and that i jumped the gun a bit on our second date he said  that  s okay i just need time to sort myself out before making any decisions  he  s very very stressed from work   sleep deprived and i know things have been vague between us which i know <type>s do n t like but i was wishing to clarify those feelings soon i do n t know how to interpret those messages   should i push for specifics so i can perhaps help him with what  s going on or let him have his space    we are still talking to each other but at a far slower pace i still want to make this work but i feel like i may have missed the chance   i feel like we still need to have a proper conversation about what  s going on   and i want to reconfirm my feelings for him properly but i do n t know when  s best to do that   and as a call   a voice note   a text    he  s too shy to ever bring anything up like this to me   i usually have to make the first move any <type> perspectives would be greatly appreciated on how to navigate the situation   thank you

intj,please help     i want to know more about how you guys think   we just reached a   year mark around a month ago we are pretty compatible and happy with each other whenever we are together we were in a long distance relationship and i would drive to see hime twice a month and stay at his place over the weekend as of lately   we have been arguing a lot more   mostly when we are far apart and have to call each other we argued mostly because i was anxious due to his texting frequency has gone down quite a bit since the start of the relationship and it concerns me that his feelings for me might have changed after the recent argument   he said to stop texting each other he would like some time and space to think as he isn t sure if we are right for each other or not and declare of breaking up but for now he said he would get back to me but also said if i am completely sure that i want to know his decision after some time has passed   which confuses me with his previous statement of just breaking up for now i know for a fact that he cares for me a lot and so do i after some time of contemplation and think back about what could have gone wrong   i texted him and tell him all of the things that i could have done better and offer lots of solution to accommodate his difficulty in the relationship   including moving closer to him and working on my anxious side we have a snap streak going on and he wants to continue the streak so we still sending pictures so there is still somewhat of a contact we also still share each other the location one more thing that i am hopeful about in this situation is that he told me he has done better in one of the aspect that we had problem out of nowhere he politely told me again that he want some time and the he just not gonna forget about me so just let him have some space and is trying to think after i texted him all of the solutions and the fault that i made to him   i am not texting him anymore cause i already tried my best to tell him how we can work on things as best as i could i decided to wait for him but i would like to ask everyone to understand more about the ambiguous behavior and do you think if we have a chance of reunion    i am also confuse if he still care for me so much   then why can t it be a break but a break up for now       thank you for your insight 
istj,despite what the vile televangelist preachers say   america is not   and was never meant to be a christian nation no   for after all   the founders were deists   if anything moreover   it is precisely a couple of nations   whom americans hate and dread above all others   over in europe   namely russia and germany    dare i make mention of either    which really were founded on the christian religion you see   that is precisely why they have   historically   been more than a bit anti jewish from deism   of course   comes the conception of the separation of church and state and   from the separation of church and state comes the idea of the citizenship clause of the   th amendment of the us constitution that is   the idea that any born within the borders of the united states of america is a us citizen   with all the rights of one indeed   the   th amendment   could be termed the separation of nation and state of course   having said that   i may as well say that i consider myself to be a deist after all   christianity is more than a bit anti jewish for my taste and   that is especially true of roman catholic christianity   with its replacement theology and any who have read the history of europe   in any depth   realizes that adolf hitler   heinrich himmler   and most of the other top nazi officials were born into the roman catholic faith mind you   the founders were wise for coming up with the separation of church and state for they knew that they   as deists   would always be a minority and   it was one way of keeping the christians from persecuting muslims and jews while at the same time not harming christians too much   lest christians accuse us of persecuting them 
entp,<type>s are often pegged as argumentative folks   so i just want to ask the <type>s on this forum how argumentative confrontational are you and what is your style of confrontation    ex sarcastic   direct   etc       
isfj,there seemed to be some pushback when i posted a similar list by susan storm on the <type> forum no one should take this list verbatim if anything   there may be another list posted in another forum where you can compare and contrast the differences and similarities based on ms storm  s assessment   you crave a sense of continuity knowing what to expect in life is crucial to you as an <type> having a plan   routine   and structure for your day gives you a sense of peace and frees up your mind to focus on more exciting things you naturally create routines   pleasant rituals   and habits that make your life feel dependable and positive   you have an extraordinary sense of responsibility it s vital to you to follow through on what you ve said you will do your word isn t given lightly   and when you make a commitment it s held close to your heart you believe in loyalty   reliability   and selflessness and try to emulate this in your life   you experience the present through filters of your past almost instantaneously   you make comparisons between what s happening now and what happened in the past you tend to see patterns because of this   and readily notice when an action doesn t fit the pattern you ll quickly notice when someone s body language changes   when their tone of voice changes   or even when a room has been re decorated in a minor way this is because you are constantly making comparisons and noticing when there s an aberration in the overall pattern   you enjoy creating traditions and pleasing rituals whether you re re creating your grandmother s best chocolate chip cookie recipe or celebrating the winter s solstice by lighting a candle and listening to your favorite songs   traditions are close to your heart you naturally create pleasant rituals and enjoy revisiting them year after year to commemorate special moments in your life   you replay the past in vivid detail you have a vivid and rich internal memory and you enjoy recalling beautiful memories regularly re experiencing your favorite memories can get you into a state of flow and can remind you of the events that have made life worth living at the same time   you can also replay negative past experiences in vivid detail you might lie awake in bed at night replaying about something embarrassing you did in junior high or a relationship blunder you regret it s crucial for you to learn to forgive yourself for past mistakes so that you don t get wrapped up in a cycle of punishing yourself for them   you have nuanced inner body sensations you tend to notice inner body signals very quickly this can mean noticing symptoms of sickness earlier than other types or tasting nuances in flavors that others miss because you re so sensitive to inner body sensations   you prioritize getting enough sleep   eating at consistent times   and taking care of yourself physically   you thrive when you can do detail oriented projects alone whether you re knitting a sweater   carving   cooking   or weeding your garden   you enjoy being alone to really immerse yourself in the details of something when you can tune out all the noise of the outer world and really delve into a project in depth you experience a calming sense of satisfaction   you have favorite tv shows you ll never tire of re watching maybe you have a doctor who marathon every summer or a gilmore girls party every fall whatever it is   there s probably a book or television series that you watch annually because it puts you in a particular mood and helps you commemorate a tradition that brings you joy or makes you laugh   you have a strong sense of what you should or should not do you are guided by your values and regularly assess your actions to see if they re lining up with what your conscience is telling you a sense of should or should not guides you and influences the actions you take you put a lot of thought into your decisions to see if the consequences will be things you can be proud of    you love good vibes creating a relaxed   optimistic atmosphere is something that brings you a lot of joy you enjoy swapping jokes and interesting stories with your friends   making your house smell nice with candles or baked goods   or playing low key competitive games creating   or being in   an atmosphere that is laid back   harmonious   and pleasant is food for your soul    you innately know what people want you quickly pick up on the non verbalized needs and emotions of other people if you have friends over   you immediately notice if someone seems cold and might need a blanket or someone is looking around and probably wants to know where the bathroom is you also notice when one person seems to like another person or when somebody wants to give criticism but is trying to figure out the most tactful way to give it    it can be difficult for you to take care of yourself because you re so focused on others this is especially true of <type> parents and spouses because <type>s are so in tune with the emotional and physical needs of others they can feel compelled to fix things for everyone else instead of meeting their own needs they often feel guilty for taking time for themselves   especially if they know others are struggling or could use some help eventually   this tends to lead to burnout or co dependency   so it s crucial for <type>s to learn to set healthy boundaries and practice saying no    you are very protective of family you ll go the extra mile to protect your loved ones from harm especially those in your family or inner circle of friends you have a gift for creating stability   security   and dependability for the people you care about it s like you create a force field of protection and gentle care around the people you love    you thrive when you can create something high quality you d rather do something well than do it fast while you are extremely conscious of deadlines   it s more important for you to produce high quality results than to get something done ahead of schedule you get a sense of pleasure from perfecting every detail of a project or task and many people consider you to be meticulous    when you re stressed   you see negative possibilities everywhere during cases of extreme or chronic stress   you get lost in catastrophic thinking you imagine dozens of worst case scenarios and every negative possibility makes you think of another connected tragedy find out ways to manage stress here how each myers briggs personality type reacts to stress   and how to help    you dislike telling people what to do you d rather give people information than be overly directive with them for example   instead of saying   bob   would you set up a hotel reservation for august   th    you might say   bob   do you know a good hotel for our trip on august   th       you also dislike being told what to do while you might seem quiet and agreeable on the outside   inside you re a bit of a rebel you can handle some structure and rules   but you don t like dealing with authoritative   rank pulling individuals you appreciate people who give everyone a chance to have a voice in a decision you believe that the best decision comes from collaboration    you don t ask things of others you wouldn t do yourself you hate intruding on others time and space   so delegating can be hard for you you re unlikely to ask someone to do something you wouldn t do   and many times you try to just do things yourself rather than asking for help    you get quiet when you get upset you are famously patient and understanding   but there are limits when you ve been angered by someone repeatedly   you re likely to get quiet and retreat into mental analysis this is when you delve into your sensing and thinking functions you try to find the rational reasons for your anger and explore whether there are any logical inconsistencies you re not seeing you also try to look at the history of the situation to see if there are any negative patterns that are repeating themselves just be careful if you keep stifling your anger it s likely to come out in a surprisingly explosive way while it may be difficult to verbalize your anger   it s an important part of a healthy relationship    you have a good sense of humor you enjoy lighthearted banter   friendly teasing   and situational humor you also enjoy sharing memes or funny gifs online you tend to find something offbeat and funny in nearly any situation   but you don t always verbalize it you might just get a sparkle in your eye and a half smile on your face as a funny scenario or impression plays in your mind s eye you can even be gifted in turning a conflict situation into something funny and helping people to laugh about it    you crave tangible sensory experiences you enjoy taking your favorite objects in your hands and touching them   noticing every detail on your fingertips you savor the texture of warm   fuzzy socks and cherish the first sip of a hot cup of tea when you feel something   you try to notice every detail about it and experience it in all its intensity    you re wary of intrusive people while you re typically friendly   generous   and easy going   people who seem especially needy or physically overbearing make you put your guard up you like steady   loyal relationships where you have the freedom to disappear for a busy week or two    or month even    and re connect as if no time has ever gone by people who blow up your phone with texts or are always invading your personal space often make you feel uncomfortable and hesitant    you take great joy in simple pleasures you believe that life is made up of thousands of precious moments that other people fail to appreciate in their hurry from the glisten of dewdrops on a blade of grass to the taste of an icy cold popsicle on a hot summer day   you try to savor all the little details and moments that make life worth living    you struggle to see your own potential you tend to struggle when it comes to forecasting your abilities and potential you live from moment to moment and try to enjoy all that life has to offer   but you don t always know how to anticipate what s coming down the road years from now you may have incredible gifts and abilities that could be used in powerful ways   but it often takes a friend to help you realize the potential of your many

enfj,there is a very outgoing female coworker who recently started working at the university    different department   same building    she is quite attractive and appears to be very self assured   pleasant   and gives off an impression of being outspoken and easygoing around people however   when she first began working here   we would occasionally cross paths in the corridor   yet she would n t acknowledge me so   i decided to take the initiative and introduce myself things went smoothly we engaged in some small talk however   despite this   she continued to be a bit distant and chilly whenever we passed each other in the corridor   occasionally even ignoring me as a result   i eventually gave up and moved on surprisingly   several weeks later   she came up to me while i was with a group of colleagues at a university event and remarked    oh   you  re here     initiating a conversation exclusively with me from that point on   whenever she encounters me   she seems genuinely enthusiastic to greet me this positive shift made me to consider asking her out coincidentally   we sometimes take the same train home and have started sitting across from each other during the commute however   during these train rides   she once again appears a bit perplexed    which is contradictory to her behavior at work with colleagues    she seems nervous   fidgety   and distant when we  re seated across from each other i even have an intuitive sense that she might be feeling uncomfortable yet   back within the university environment   she engages in teasing when we meet in the corridor   playfully mimicking my behavior often she is at the other end of the corridor   always waving at me when she sees me sometimes   she even passes by my office   pauses for a moment   and greets me with a cheerful  helloooo   insert my name   however   as soon as i turn around to respond   she simply smiles at me and quickly hurries away i m left wondering whether this pattern of behavior aligns with common traits of an <type> personality i m posing this question because i  ve developed an interest in her and would like to ask her out however   her behavior on the train is somewhat confuses me 
enfj,hi hi hi   for context i am an <type> female and i had a really incredible date with this <type> last week it  s funny because i really was n t intending on even seeing him at first we met on a dating app about   months ago and he always came across really sweet in messages    and he was definetly my type    but things would happen which would cause us to lose contact in one instance he took two days to respond to me    which i later found out was because he was at an airsoft competiton       doing outdoor <type> things i guess          but it turned me off because i did n t appreciate the switch up of being completely dedicated and attentive to just suddenly disappearing i also could n t be sure if he was being honest   or just felt like ignoring me i felt myself becoming insecure and those negative feelings caused me to respond less and less and then not at all he was very persistant   however   and eventually we did meet last week and i left that date thinking that finally meeting him was the best choice of my life i thought he felt the same way   as he texted me as soon as he got home and all throughout this week then yesterday   his replies were very slow i am used to him taking a bit of time inbetween replies but that day he did n t text me good morning or at all throughout the day until about  pm he apologized and said he had n t seen my messages    i frequently get this kind of text from him but it never bothered me because his apologies always seemed sincere    he then asked me if i was busy this weekend to which i responded yes    i m going to london tomorrow    and after a bit more small talk he asked me if there was any chance that i would be free tonight i was immeadiatly elated and was already in the process of mentally planning what i would wear i immeadiatly texted back saying i can be did you want to hang out    he waited two hours to respond and then said i did want to hang out but im too tired i didnt go to the gym today either i was of course upset that he made me wait two hours just to say no   but i was more so sad because i actually genuinely wanted to see him    and i rarely genuinely want to go anywhere that is n t the comfort of my own home    i still forced myself to think positively though because it meant a lot to me that he even wanted to see me in the first place i said oh ok       and that was that    keep in mind im leaving out the other little casual conversations we were having in between all of this   when talking to him i always try to match energy and be just as kind he can be quite caring and complimenty and i always try to reciprocate that so he feels appreciated    but today he has n t texted me at all no contact and its   pm as i mentioned   the way he replies has been something that  s bothered me since we first met i genuinely do n t know what to do because i do think he is a good guy   but i just opperate under the assumption that if you like someone you talk to them throughout the day even if you  re a bad texter   you at least send a good morning or ask how their day went    i was a bit dry with the last message i sent to him   as i was a little upset and its hard for me to hide that   but i still do n t think thats any excuse    what do you think    is this normal    why would he wait so long to tell me he ca n t see me and then just not talk to me after that    i almost want to say something about it   ask if he  s ok or if he  s uninterested    more so i can just stop expending mental energy towards his actions    but it  s really not in my nature to do something like that and i would hate to come across as clingy or bossy i m not   i do n t ever want to make him talk to me if he does n t want to i more just want to know why his texting is so unreliable it causes me to spiral and write long essay style posts on mbti forums 
entp,these people i went with   went to sleep like    pm   and   i am like sitting by myself until    then even that is too early but i do n t sleep at    pm hell   i also do n t think you live your life fully   going to bed that early 
estp,hi   finally know i am a <type> thought i was a <type> etc etc freakin so i dont know intuition    too late thou    plus now what a bummer but still lived as a <type> beer and all 
intp,flirty <type>  s out there i once made a thread am i a flirt and my recent interaction made me ask myself how do <type>  s flirt    
entp,hello <type>s as i was perusing some mbti stats   i came across an infograph showing <type>s as having the highest rate of being self employed for those of you who are self employed   what prompted you to go on your own vs be someone else s employee    what do you enjoy most about your own business    
istj,my bestie is <type> t   i m <type> t and one of her closest friend is <type> a is it weird that <type>s are close to <type>s    what can attract us    we are childhood friend   my first one    we were already together in kindergarten   and when i went away for health issues she was really sad and had difficulties with other children she said it to me    i feel her as a cute   strong   clever   stubborn   kind and perfectionist girl   the one i can always trust i asked her what she thinks about me and she only said you are you   you should know who you are she doesn t give many explanations   she opens while talking and not asking but she cares   i see with actions so   i was curious about what can help a friendship between an <type> and an <type> do you have <type>s friends    
esfp,hi <type>s   so i have this close guy friend who is an <type> tbh   i put him on decent attractiveness level   he has a steady career in it    not crazy money but not broke either      he  s friendly   personable   basically i m just getting all the superficial stuff out of the way to make him not seem like a repulsive bum in any way that a girl would n t consider him he has this one ex   let  s call her c    which we will get to later    who he dated maybe   years ago and ca n t stop romanticizing her however   in the course of that breakup up until now he has tried to date maybe   girls who he became absolutely infatuated with very early into getting to know them and they all refused to commit to him because he seemed too much for them he would become extremely clingy   needy   and put these girls on a pedestal before they could even determine their true feelings towards him basically   doing boyfriend things without actually being their boyfriend i told him to stop doing this until the girl earns your love   but he just ca n t seem to help himself once he feels an attraction towards her i do n t want to be sexist here   but i can see this behavior being more tolerable i guess as a female trait but it kind of is frowned upon coming from a guy he would then be left absolutely demoralized and feel used for all the love and attention he gave them only to not receive it back i personally see this as illogical since on the girl  s end   she did n t even say she was ready for all this attention when they were merely just trying to get to know him during this time fast forward to present time   he  s now pretty cynical when it comes to love he refuses to get close to women he wo n t even go with the flow and sleep around have fun because he  s afraid of repeating his mistakes he just pictures himself choosing the wrong girl   getting hurt again   and does n t even bother pursuing anybody it  s been like this for almost a year now going back go his ex   c he will occasionally think about her or have dreams about her and have it ruin his mood all day because of it it seems like he views her as the girl who got away and ca n t seem to move past it even though that can no longer be rekindled it seems like he keeps comparing himself to what he used to have and who he used to be with her and compare it to how he does n t have that right now and then beats himself over it for all the <type> guys on here or even girls who have had this issue   is this relatable to you    also   how have you dealt with trying to tone down your emotions and know when to give to someone your time love vs knowing when it  s the wrong time <type>s are super sweet do n t get me wrong they make absolutely amazing supportive friends who are always down to have a good time   however i can see how their se fi   when not curbed correctly   can be put into absolute override and become overwhelming to the person on the receiving end please i really want to offer some advice to him to get over this hump but as an <type>   i feel like the solutions and advice i give him might just be a little too logical for him to relate to if you guys can give me some sort of insight that will resonate with him or a comparable story and how you personally got through it   it would be incredibly helpful thanks   
infj,they say a picture is worth a thousand words and words are quite valuable   if you pick the right ones so   anyway   sometimes i glance through pictures of nature   picture of animals   pictures i drew   and pick out one that most reflects my current mood it  s a fun little activity that lets you show    not just tell    someone how you are feeling plus   it lets you get a little creative while looking at pretty pictures of things i figured since we have a thread about posting music that describes your mood   it might be fun feel free to explain as much or as little as you want about your picture selection and of course   like a good <type>   if someone is having a bad day   feel free to cheer them up with happy pictures   or words i do n t own any of the pictures i post   unless otherwise stated alright   enough rambling this is a picture that best describes my current mood i think this one is fitting seemingly peaceful and beautiful on the surface   but deep in the cavern thing under the rock   it  s a bit dark i feel like there  s a lot of stress hanging over me    like the giant rock      and i m not quite sure why i mean   life looks good right now    except for a few minor hiccups      but instead of enjoying the scenery   i feel trapped under a rock b does that make sense    edit why is it so tiny    here is a link to a bigger size http   bp blogspot com  gne crpp kkwtcpm s    rock outcropping            jpg
entj,hi peeps   fellow <type> here i need some practical advice regarding some work issues i am facing at work with my manager for me   i often can see the inefficiency in things and try to change the way of doing certain things at work to make things more efficient my manager sees it differently and prefer to do things the same way he has been doing things the thing is   i feel both of us are not wrong it is just that i am an overachiever and tend to want to do things the best i could yet my manager prefer to do things just good enough   and value efficiency over quality   as such he can complete things in just   to   days   but i am requesting for a week to complete   which he declined my proposal the thing is   the deadline is still far   and there are ample time to do things and don t understand why is he rushing me to do things his way i have even highlighted this issue with him   but the answer i got from him is by far   vague in fact   i m still unsure why he made such a decision the reason why i need a week to do things because i am an industrial designer   and i want to elevate my company product quality as much as possible   and often require time to think of innovative ways to find solutions to create great products   but because my manager just wants things good enough and value efficiency   therefore he expect me to do the same and give me the same deadline   which i can t   because like i say   i want to create really great products for the company and humankind to be honest   which require time to think again   i have tried addressing his concern and tells him i have a different agenda compare to him   and that the deadline is still far   i don t see the issue of needing to rush and prompted him to let me try my method of doing things at last   he dictated me to follow his method i am at the point i feel like resigning   as this is not once i have such communication breakdown with him and only to have him dictating me i have tried to just be a good follower and do whatever my manager says without questioning but i feel dead inside   as if my work has no purpose and i am doing just for the paycheque eventually   i decided to be clear with my agenda   which is actually beneficial to the company therefore i have many conflict yet the manager cannot find a reason to fire me   because he has to explain to my director because i didn t do anything wrong   he cannot just report to the director regarding the issues that is happening between us the reason why i feel like resigning because first i find it difficult to work with a manager that makes inefficient decision and there is nothing i can do about it and have to do work that i do not believe in the first place such torture is something i have to accept if i continue working here    i just have an realisation writing this lol    i wonder what will fellow <type> do here feel free to be direct and criticise me if there is anything i have done wrongly if you need me to explain the situation in deeper detail   feel free to ask as i intend to keep this post short thanks in advance   
esfj,<type>s   do y all do this    asking cuz i think i might be one too i m    and still in high school   it may be different have the tendency to ask others before making a decision on things like not just one or two people but like everyone in regards to a decision i m also an enneagram   for the record get off topic easily and can be random and weird my friends say i can be very random and weird   because i can be very open with people    say talking about kinks when most people don t talk about that stuff    and i swear a lot   and i have the tendency to get off topic easily and connect unrelated things together push your values onto others without meaning to i can do this a lot without meaning to   like if someone has an opposing view of something    say homosexuality      i ll have the tendency to try and make them change their opinion on it   even though it s their opinion quit something when it gets difficult i ve had the tendency to quit something when it gets difficult   like in  th grade   i was in art club and didn t get the hang of sewing and i felt embarrassed and judged because the  th graders understood it better than me and didn t return to the club for a few meetings i came up with excuses until my parents forced me back into it and broke down crying being indecisive and disorganized i am really disorganized and suck at being on time and i m also really indecisive   hence why i ask for opinions on everything suck at building a routine and getting out of habits here s the thing i don t mind a routine as long as it s not too boring i d prefer a routine because i can be very disorganized but the routine never lasts i also suck with bad habits or trying to build new ones they never last more than a day or two not rebellious i have really strict parents and looking back on my childhood   sometimes i wonder why i didn t really rebel as a child like i was forced to wear uniform at a public school so my parents could make me proper because we couldn t afford private school and i didn t really even question it like i just accepted it and was like yeah they re strict only when ninth grade happened i didn t want to wear them anymore and put my foot down and they agreed or other things like i wanted to dye my hair   but decided against it    mind you i m       because i was afraid of what they would think i already knew i would be getting in trouble with taking my braids out    cuz i m black    but i did it anyway to feel a little rebellious like some of my other friends don t mind arguing or being rebellious but it s like i struggle with that only recently you could say i ve been rebellious   but it s like minuscule things overly caring about what others think of you i really care about what other people think of me i can be sarcastic   yet i am horrible at understanding sarcasm i did this a lot last year where i would constantly ask if others were mad at me   if they hated me   if i d done something to upset them because i didn t want the friendship to end and i felt i ruined it being open and without a filter like i can be pretty open but i don t really have a filter like i ll be opening up wattpad in the middle of class with the most random and weird stuff without shame i ll do weird stuff like that or talk about stuff most people won t but it s weird like i care a lot of what others think of me if i don t get a negative reaction   then i ll do it   but when i get a negative reaction   i ll stop and apologize and then overthink what i had done and then i ll feel embarrassed that i did it being affected by others mood to be honest   i never really understood this being attributed to fe   but it happens to me a lot through tv like characters will be having an argument and i ll feel that and i ll feel anxious and want to resolve it   but obviously   it s tv   so i can t do anything about it    edit okay so i kinda realize more what this means i don t really understand the whole if you see someone crying   you start crying as well because i don t really know any fe users that do that but i ll definitely want to try and help them out   especially if they re my friend   and try to make them feel better   and if they re a stranger   i ll wonder what s troubling them if there s nothing i can do and if they re okay and i ll worry about them basically    personality change depending on who i m with i feel like this goes for everyone   but it s more notable between friends and family with family   i can be more reserved   quiet   like i d probably be pegged as an introvert   like an <type> or something because i m the opposite compared to with friends   i m more lively and energetic and outgoing with strangers   it varies edit after lots of research   i m pretty confident in saying i m an <type>   but i still want y all s opinion if y all can relate or not 
entj,here it is come one   come all   post all your random thoughts especially certain <type> thread derailers you know who you are posting this has wiped me out whew   im gonna go take a cat nap now 
esfp,my mom is <type> and the only time when she tells a lie is when she is trying to protect herself from revealing too much personal information   other times she  s quite honest and spontaneous and blunt about things even when telling jokes   it tends to be on the ironic side of things does this stem from being a se dom ni inferior    any other explanations you can think of    
infj,everyone knows and loves    okay   maybe not loves    the <type> doorslam we also are known for shutting down and withdrawing into ourselves when the world becomes too much do any of you ever feel like you experience something that is not quite a doorslam   but more like a mini shutdown that can be specific to one person or group of people    perhaps this person in particular is overwhelming you   or a situation with them has become too stressful you do not necessarily need to withdraw from everyone everything   but you do need to limit or eliminate input from this one person group on a temporary basis it can be interpreted as a doorslam by sensitive people   but i usually know when i am cutting a person out for good versus when i am simply pulling away from them for a while a personal shutdown can   however   lead to a doorslam if the party in question does not respect my need for space it could possibly function as a test for whether a person will honor your boundaries or flood you with unwanted attention instead for me   this has been the last splinter in the door before i actually slammed it in one or two cases most people   however   come back from a personal shutdown does this make sense to anyone else    
esfj,hello <type>s   in this panel interview   i got a chance to do a panel interview with personality types that all have introverted thinking   extroverted feeling   introverted sensing   and extroverted intuition in their function stack rose    <type>      drew    <type>      isaac    <type>      evelien    <type> jumper      and viktoria    <type>      all shared how they personally experience their si   ne   fe   and ti we started the interview with si and rose   evelien   and drew all think their si function is boring to isaac and viktoria   they like their si because it gives them a sense of calm isaac said that your physical space reflects your mind and if you declutter your physical space then you are also decluttering your mind next   we jumped into the topic of ne and gathering information we talked about fe and ti at the end because those two functions were very interesting during the interview   we discussed using fe for good and using fe for evil rose gave one of the best description of how masculine fe works and how other people  s negative emotions gets stuck on her and how she needs to use her ti to reduce the damage to her mental health as a result of her masculine fe isaac and everyone else confirmed that with feminine fe   once they are not in the presence of a person suffering   that feeling does n t linger drew mentioned that for him   fe is more the suffering of groups instead of individuals finally   we got to ti at the end and talked about everyone  s identity some questions i asked them includes how te shames ti    in which drew gave some very funny examples being married to someone that is lead te    isaac also gave a funny example of lead te  s using his idea and using it as just one idea as oppose to the idea to implement i ended the interview by asking everyone about fe gift giving since the stereotype of lead fe is they like giving fruit baskets as a gift or a similar concept as presents to people watch this interview here 
infj,those doses and takes altogether come in one to never make one believe he ever approach them by himself that  s what he believed as far his pattern of self love was in the domain of utility to have only its effect on self esteem   he got himself all round up against its gratuity   be it the sole element of himself he confused impersonally with their autonomous presentability for example   in the same vein of separation   one chooses his line of work   well   in which he works   studying it   and the other is simply more of the work than it is akin to study he goes pythagorician with it he studies most firstly by the name and number of all things he wants to consider in his line   same thing   and if he was not to be he concentrates on whatever does not the same as he does he goes way above that problem   and   as he goes down again for good   he reached his method he is apt to discover he never trully wanted both conclusions that  s his future is n t it   aloud as another  s more normalistic piece of work he is now absolutely sure that whatever he wanted as not part of his future was to go against his of doing so in that sense otherwise an unconsumable dose of reality is a take on one  s future it is profoundly unreconciliable one goes through end up exiting with two futures if i come to really fear it for what it is against what it might not be at all   then add one of them for each possibility this does end up into imaginatively unconsequent and unreconciliable but each time separated whole which does n t bend onto the force of any existent future   and in turn onto one deriving from its impossibility to exist   to complement itself an impossible breakthrough coming from an only possible unreconciliability the uselessness of whatever goes against those doses and takes is not even of the pattern of its unpresentability   and so forth contrarily   one  s self hate is not to be reconciliable with any normalities of a piece of work if be it going to the recognizing of this pattern   and so on open wide the gates after having closed them   yes do n t close them off after having opened them out wide

enfp, what are some questions you  d like to ask <type>s    any questions   from random to intellectual or completely offensive   welcome   d
istp,as i have said before   people wanting to know more about how cognitive functions work   will benefit from going to practical typing ryan    confirmed <type>    and mara    confirmed <type> type    put a lot of analysis into their articles eliminating the bias from other systems of thought recently mara gave her thoughts on how ixtp types use extraverted feeling here is what she had to say   inferior fe users are anti marketing for <type>s and <type>s   the pure logic or legitimacy of the idea should reign supreme these types are willing to pursue any idea or thought that might be true   regardless of the implications however   once they discover what they deem to be true   they don t want to have to dumb it down for you    bear in mind   i m not saying these types are inherently smart i m speaking from their perspective    practically speaking   this means that an ixtp that produces a novel idea will innately struggle that idea of marketing that idea to others   beyond relaying or demonstrating the pure rationale of the idea stereotypically   this is why you see the genius inventor always teaming up with a business partner the inventor usually lacks the business sense   and needs the partner   yet often struggles with the tactics utilized by the business partner in an ixtp s ideal world   all they should have to do is explain what they produced or thought of   and people should automatically get it and see it s value if the idea or product is good   it should thrive without any social effort   inferior fe users dismiss the value of connections high extraverted judgers    fjs or tjs    typically recognizes the value in utilizing the system to their advantage this often includes the people in it remember the saying   it s not what you know it s who you know    <type>s and <type>s by default want to rise through the ranks purely on their own skill   knowledge or merit they don t want to have to cater to others   make themselves likeable   etc that s not to say they won t want friends or won t be personable   but in their minds   none of that should matter in a professional sense or be rooted in a long term success strategy these types have a strong independent streak social connections are not something they ll want to go out of their way to form   inferior fe users may dismiss the value of credentials sometimes official education    which typically results in credentials of some kind    is necessary to learn a trade or profession other times   one can learn a skill without going through any official program however   many people value credentials they like to see it as proof of the person s expertise or legitimacy so   in many cases   it s valuable to collect credentials to bolster your personal marketability this is a concept that <type>s and <type>s may innately struggle with after all   like i mentioned in the previous point   they believe their skill knowledge should speak for itself the concept of gaining credentials for the sake of currying favor or earning legitimacy will frustrate them and feel like a frivolous waste of time   inferior fe users can fail to infuse emotional value into their work inferior feelers are often disconnected from their own emotions and emotions in general to some degree as a result   many inferior feelers struggle to connect with people in a deep   meaningful   or intimate way however   another aspect of the feeling function is it s focus on emotional value people like to relate the feeling functions    and thus   feelers    to values   but technically every individual has values    feeling vs thinking what are values       the feeling functions specifically deal with the personal   emotional   and social implications of values so   getting back to inferior fe   the struggle that an <type> or <type> may have is infusing value into their work in such a way that other people will find it valuable or relatable   inferior fe users have anxiety concerning social protocol   not social anxiety in general ok   here s where i ve often gotten inferior fe wrong many people suffer from social anxiety an ixtp s anxiety is more specific than that an ixtp who is starting to develop their inferior fe   or at the very least   has not suppressed it   will simultaneously feel aware of   yet blind to   social protocol in other words   they know it s there   and that it should be adhered to   but they don t know how to do that if the ixtp doesn t care to make any kind of impact or find their role in society   then this awareness may not matter to them they ll avoid scenarios that are too cumbersome   and make friends that don t emotionally or socially pressure them    people   generally speaking   may not actually be a source of stress    however   the anxiety will kick in when their inferior fe begins developing enough to give them a desire to make a social impact or find where they belong in the quote above   carl jung said   he is none the less beset by the greatest anxiety if ever he has to make it an objective reality this anxiety is specific to when ti dominants want to take their ideas knowledge and implement them within reality    in other words   contribute to society    they re aware of their struggle to make a social impact and emotionally connect with others   but feel compelled on some level to share their ideas or abilities with the world in that area   they feel inferior   and fear rejection or failure because of this inadequacy    yet   the very idea that they could be successful if they simply found a way to adapt whatever they re capable of contributing stirs up some level of disdain within themselves because their work in it s purest form should be good enough    click to expand i omitted some personal experiences mara shares in the article if you want see what she has to say   you can read the article in its entirety here besides after reading the article   like me i think you will be able to conjure up your own experiences from inferior use of fe enjoy   
intj,are <type> men usually into motherly women    i have two male <type> friends and it  s weird how they both seem to like women who love children   are open about their feelings and are in overall very caring dating or even marrying someone who does n t share their intelligence seems to be ok for them i do n t understand it and it  s difficult for me    <type>    to get along with the women my friends go out with 
intp,<type>  w  sp so avoidant anxious depressed i recently began a new relationship in the past few months   and i m uncertain whether it was the right decision before this   i believed i was n t ready to embark on a new relationship after the end of my previous one i have deep seated trust issues   particularly in the context of intimate relationships while i was able to manage these issues in my last relationship   i ca n t help but wonder if it left a lasting   perhaps subconscious   impact on me   despite initially feeling okay about it my previous relationship came to an end due to a multitude of factors   and one significant issue was the emotional instability of my partner    an <type>    this instability often manifested in ways that made me feel physically unsafe at times additionally   i was affected by their negative emotions towards others whenever i brought up the topic of needing more space   suggesting they stay at their place when they were busy with their stuff   or proposing that we stop seeing each other every day for a while   they would get really upset when i mentioned possibly pausing the relationship for a bit   they would try to apologize and either slap themselves or kneel down as a way to show their apology    though i probably was n t even trying to blame them for anything    when i locked them out   they would knock on the front door continuously   even if there were people outside   and call my name while spamming my phone with calls i felt like they were projecting onto me and not recognizing me as an individual   but rather as some kind of comforting toy that babies need i kind of just went with the flow after that because i was scared it might get physical after the breakup   i was somewhat taken aback by my emotional response unlike what i expected   i did n t find myself engulfed in the usual feelings of sadness or heartbreak that often accompany the end of a significant relationship instead   there was a sense of relief and even a newfound sense of freedom i have consistently grappled with the task of identifying and comprehending my emotions   a challenge that often complicates conflict management   as i tend to shy away from confrontations for as long as i can recall   my life has operated in survival mode trusting or relying on anyone   including my own family   has proven to be a daunting endeavor i m not particularly in need of company   but i do recognize the importance of having some form of support and individuals to turn to when assistance is required while i primarily lean on my friends for such support   i must admit that i do n t feel exceptionally close to them my perspective on relationships has undergone significant changes   particularly following the conclusion of my first romantic relationship   as mentioned in the preceding paragraph my attachment style began shifting even before i entered that initial relationship   and it has now veered more towards the extreme avoidance end of the spectrum i was once able to place trust in my former partner   but it has grown increasingly challenging i perceive romantic feelings as finite resources   ones that   once depleted   are exceedingly difficult   if not impossible   to replenish now i  ve been grappling with a fear that my significant other may not view me as a human being   but rather as some kind of object they can use to satisfy their desires   which can extend to abstract desires such as exploiting my insecurities or manipulating me or trying to shape me to better match their ideals the significant other i m currently with is either an <type> or <type>    i m still uncertain      as he mentioned that he received the result of <type> after taking the    personalities test however   i believe he is more closely aligned with <type> for the following reasons   when he is n t feeling emotionally well   he tends to revert to his routine   simply lying in bed and doing nothing   prior to our relationship   his life maintained a consistent routine   which i find boring rather than stable for example   he eats the same breakfast every day on the other hand   he struggles to express himself in a linear manner he often conveys his thoughts by repeating the same idea in various ways and using numerous filler words my guess is that this is not due to a lack of ability but rather because he feels uncomfortable sometimes   when i ask him a question that should elicit a simple yes or no response   he tends to elaborate to the point where i must redirect his thoughts and encourage him to provide a straightforward answer    yes or no    i do n t need all that extra elaboration i just need a decision he has had some challenging relationships from my perspective   and i m uncertain about the prospects of our relationship the partners i  ve had in this relationship and the previous one tend to be more on the clingy side it makes me wonder if there  s something about me that attracts this type   although i m not entirely sure maybe it  s the anxious avoidant waltz in my opinion   when a relationship encounters problems   both parties share some level of responsibility   even if it is n t necessarily a       split i attempted to distance myself from him several times in the past few months   but it has n t been successful he would physically come to my apartment and wait for me to come out eventually   i gave up and started to view it as fate   accepting it as an experience i must go through in life at that time   we were not in a romantic relationship we were just friends his actions made me feel extremely anxious because i sensed that he was crossing boundaries and suffocating me additionally   we had differing perceptions of our relationship back then   he was more possessive than he should be because the the boundary and personal space issue   we  ve gone through many arguments in the past now that we  re in a romantic relationship because i gave in and i m tired of having to face these arguments and think i might as well as just start to hold a more serious view on this relationship      by changing it into a romantic relationship      thing will become better as of now   things are more balanced and improved i did n t make this decision only because i want to avoid arguments   but also because i replicate feelings towards him    though i might not have chosen this if things were n t how they were    certainly   it  s important to acknowledge the positive aspects of the relationship as well i appreciate that he has taken on a significant role in helping me with essential tasks that have contributed to my well being   such as ensuring i eat and helping with chores his support in these aspects has been meaningful and valuable to me we  ve also developed many inside jokes and share similar humor we still have communication issues and occasionally run into misunderstandings   but despite the challenges we  ve faced   there are certainly good moments too however   i must admit that our relationship has exhibited signs of toxicity he has expressed a desire to address these issues by considering the possibility of visiting a relationship therapist to work through our issues we may explore this option when both of us have the time available to do so i may consistently place my own needs as a top priority and often experience insecurity when it comes to being in relationships while this individual has openly expressed their care for me and has gone to great lengths to show it   i still find that it does n t completely alleviate my feelings of insecurity    they are insecure   too    i still do n t understand the meaning of romantic relationships however   i find contentment in my own company and with my friends i do n t feel the need for marriage or dating   as i genuinely enjoy my solitude i believe i prefer not to carry the weight of emotional responsibilities   as i tend to take them quite seriously maybe romantic relationships wo n t ever work for me maybe romantic relationships are n t for me 
entj,hey everyone   new poster here so i apologize if there are threads similar to this one most entries about <type>  s state that once their decision is made to break up with a partner   it  s final and there  s no looking back i just wanted to know what goes on in your heads when it  s over    especially if you were in a serious relationship and they were your first true love    from what i understand   <type>  s tend to not be sentimental and move on fairly quickly    do you guys ever think about your ex  s and if so what triggers that train of thought    places   songs   dreams   etc       how often do you think of them and how long does it take you guys to get over them    i know it varies from relationship to relationship and why you break up so i guess i  ll add some background as to why i m asking my boyfriend and i had been dating for a year and   months long distance and i was his first girlfriend he is fairly religious so he wanted to wait until he met someone really special at the pinnacle of our relationship he would baby me all the time   talk about our future and how he wanted to take care of me we  ve met each other  s parents and friends   went on short trips together and would fly to see each other every now and then we  ve had our fights but in the end we usually took them as signs of growth it was n t until i became really depressed    being far away from my friends and family and all    that things started getting a little messy initially we broke up because i became more needy and he told me he did n t know how to take care of me anymore if you are an <type> and broke up with your girlfriend   have you ever gotten back together with her    do you guys still have a sweet spot for that extra special someone    how do you guys move on so well    i m an <type> <type> so i m a very sentimental hopeless romantic type of girl

enfp,thanks to witty on the tip on this one i love the set up can you guess what kind of mbti personality wrote this       i felt like it was easy to guess i guess i will say more on that later i felt like they mixed up the definitions of some of their top functions a bit and didn t understand the functions they don t have very well   but   again   i love the set up   this is a test that i think could be quite successful if fine tuned the michael caloz cognitive functions test want to better understand who you are    unlike other    types tests   this one goes way beyond the usual   letters to explore the deeper cognitive functions www michaelcaloz com
intp,i thought that we could use a thread like this i know there is a confessions thread   but that  s not quite the same   and we have n t had a proper <type> madness thread    which is my reading of stream of consciousness    since the crush thread and it  s ill begotten clones were banished to the land of winds and ghosts    also known as spam world    so    copying from the original    take issue with something going on in society    having a bad day    have something on your mind that wont go away    experience something so fabulous you just have to express it    accidentally sold your mother to a pimp in a back alley game of poker    have an idea   or discover something so amazing you must tell everyone    post your vent    or experience   idea   etc    here   note    s    this thread is not for venting about other members   the moderators   or the forum do n t over spam the thread    i ca n t expect <type>s not to spam a least a little    lest it be sent screaming into the spam abyss 
esfj,heyyyy   i was searching and could n t find an <type> pictures thread   so all you fine <type>s let  s show perc how easy we are on the eyes               let  s make this fun and post   
infj,hi everyone i used to post on here a long time ago great that the place is still around even the poem thread still exists cool i have cptsd i go to therapy   i m doing the work   and i am getting better a lot and have   for awhile recently i wanted to look up an <type> personality profile again   because of a conversation i was having with someone about the decade of recovery work i had been doing   which started with the myers briggs i had gotten out of a bad situation   and maybe i just really needed to feel seen at the time   but i remember sobbing reading the <type> profile for the first time reading it again   over    years later   i had a very different reaction it felt like they were describing the coping mechanism of people that experienced prolonged trauma in a situation they cannot escape from it felt like the personality that is being described is that of unrecognized trauma   because i recognize that person as the traumatized labor of love who did n t yet know how to deal with all these feelings and experiences he was having   and who did n t have a context to make sense of them   yet so   i got curious i m going to post the list of traits of adult children of alcoholics and dysfunctional families   and i m wondering if any of you guys resonate with it the laundry list    traits of an adult child of an alcoholic or dysfunctional family we became isolated and afraid of people and authority figures we became approval seekers and lost our identity in the process we are frightened by angry people and any personal criticism we either become alcoholics   marry them or both   or find another compulsive personality such as a workaholic to fulfill our sick abandonment needs we live life from the viewpoint of victims and we are attracted by that weakness in our love and friendship relationships we have an overdeveloped sense of responsibility and it is easier for us to be concerned with others rather than ourselves this enables us not to look too closely at our own faults   etc we get guilt feelings when we stand up for ourselves instead of giving in to others we became addicted to excitement we confuse love and pity and tend to love people we can pity and rescue we have stuffed our feelings from our traumatic childhoods and have lost the ability to feel or express our feelings because it hurts so much    denial    we judge ourselves harshly and have a very low sense of self esteem we are dependent personalities who are terrified of abandonment and will do anything to hold on to a relationship in order not to experience painful abandonment feelings   which we received from living with sick people who were never there emotionally for us alcoholism is a family disease and we became para alcoholics and took on the characteristics of that disease even though we did not pick up the drink para alcoholics are reactors rather than actors tony a       
isfj,hello   male <type> here asking about female <type> we are both in early     s positives she is super nice to me in person she is very conservative   but let me touch her while does n t allow anyone else to do so she told me secretes about her childhood that even her family does n t know she cried in front of me several times she tried to cook for me she invited me several times to meet she told me her phone code i told her once i liked her hair this way   so she started to do it like i told her she smiles with me like i am a comedian negatives she is online almost all the time after her work   but replies to my texts usually after a day   with short answers   and does n t ask questions to keep the conversation going in the middle of texting   she disappears for an hour   and comes back like nothing happened lately   i sent her   questions   she replied to one   and told me she was busy i told her ok   but i need answers for the rest   the next day   she told me again she was busy the next day she apologized for not replying because she was busy   wished me a happy holiday   i wished her the same   but she did n t even opened that message   nor replied to the rest of the questions it  s now two weeks   days later from sending the questions   she sent a comic picture with a group that has only   participants   which me and her are from these participants   but still   did n t reply to me my questions   is she interested or not      is she a bad texter   or is this how <type> text   or she is simply not interested      any advice on how to deal with this situation    
entj,hello   i  ll just get right to it i have an <type> friend that i hired to do my interior design for my first home and for the most part he  s done a good job with the heavy lifting and coordinating i however have a few significant pain points    as the project comes to a close i m realizing this more and more    he makes significant changes to our original agreements   perhaps because he thinks of a better way but he never discusses this with me beforehand   and some of the changes had to be reverted because i did n t like or agree with them the latest of these was the setup of my tv which was way too high for my liking and comfort even though i specifically mentioned to not set it up without me multiple times   he did it anyway and assured me i  d be happy with the result when i visited to confirm this   i told him about it and he immediately deflected and asked me where was i when the setup was being done i mentioned that i was never informed but he insisted i was needless to say i was n t happy at what seemed to be a blatant lie and had to pay to get it lowered    had it done by professionals this time since the risk was much higher    he is really hasty and does n t listen i  ll ask a questions and he  d go on this long rant which comes off as condescending to me only for me to state he did n t even understand my question in the first place this has happened multiple times   my questions are very straight forward but it  s like he  s stuck on what he thinks i m asking and not what i m actually asking       i double check my questions with my friends in these cases to make sure i m not crazy    he takes the glory for many of the design choices that i came up with it does n t bother me as much as the other points really but it is a bit odd to be honest   a part of me feels bad to complain because he worked really hard and did a good job in many aspects   but i m really irked by what comes across as a lack of accountability he has never apologized for any of his mistakes and has even unfairly deflected some onto myself what is up with that    is it an ego thing    do <type>s have a hard time admitting they  re wrong and apologizing    
infp,this is the long and awaited thread for non <type>s ask us whatever you want to know or just come and chat with us we  re very friendly   
isfj,you all deserve better descriptions it s bad enough that sensors get shitty descriptions   but i think si users get hit it worse than an se user they see someone who is judgmental   rude   homophobic   etc and they immediately think   oh that s my mom dad   but like   not all <type>s are like that and i m saying this as someone who is questioning right now if they are one to be honest   i m a teen   and i only got into mbti to figure out what was wrong with me i honestly wish i could quit   but now i m just stuck in this series of over analyzing myself and wondering if this is who i am i know i m a sensor and i feel extroverted   because i feel like i need to be around people   or i ll get lonely and start having dark thoughts it s weird because i m usually between <type> or <type>   which are shadow functions of each other because i feel like i m both like i act confident and i ll say and do stuff without thinking and i m impulsive and i care about being true to myself and i can also relate to ni grip and a te loop but i can also relate to the ti loop as well   when it comes to focusing on past mistakes   and trying to figure out what the connection is to who i am   and if it means anything like si for example   comes when i organize   like i organized my binder yesterday and that made me feel really good as well as cleaning my room and getting my room done   and i got up early to make my lunch and get ready in time   which made me feel good knowing i had everything done or like se when it comes to improvising   it can depend   but like for assignments or school or something   i m good at it like i ll do assignments or essays at the last minute and get a     it happened with an assignment i did yesterday when it comes to fe   it s a weird thing because when someone starts crying   i don t really cry i ll feel sad and want to help them though   in any way possible and i ll check up on them i also frequently vent to my friends or i would vent online   which is something i need to work on   because i barely know how to deal with my feelings i also feel like i can be a burden and annoy people when it comes to ti   it usually comes as wanting to do the quickest thing possible or finding easy solutions to things or constantly re editing my thoughts and why i say and type   like what i am doing now   but i would also say that is te for ne   i usually use it to say weird what if scenarios   like what if i just drank that weird shit or something idk   but i also use it to think of negative what if s and think that everything is going to go wrong and it ll be like that always but idk maybe it s also ni but this turned into me rambling basically   i think you all deserved more credit i barely see any good descriptions   only a few you guys have such terrible stereotypes   which could make a lot of people not get their actual type   especially when it s si so yeah 
estj,<type> maybe best type compatible with me in a relationship and i did not meet them so how can i recognize them through conversation and asking questions and answer they will be organized and focus on present but how to spot them
estj,what do <type>s think of <type>s    personally   i really like <type>s they are very hardworking   strong   confident   organized   proper and reliable they also have a gentle and kind side   
esfj,something i do n t quite understand about <type>s is that they derive their happiness from the approval of others for example   i know an <type> who religiously tracks the number of likes they get on facebook and instagram it seems that <type>s are very kind and generous to others   but that stems from a desire to be well liked   not necessarily from philosophically valuing kindness and generosity to me    an inxj      this sounds like a very insecure approach to life how do more mature <type>s work around this    is there a better word than insecurity to describe this    can somebody clarify this for me or elaborate on this    thank you   
intj,someone asked me in one of the <type> threads about why a lot of villians are <type>s   and i started to wonder about the certain perpectives <type>s have about the world how do you   <type>s   view the world and if you conquered and were in the position to control anything and everything   what all would you do    
isfj,the difference between nice and kind would be that nice is something you do for politness while actually follow only your interests without considering other people   while kind is when you  re genuinelly good   empathy of course i do n t mean to say that all <type> are nice not kind   but i  ve seen plenty of talks in this forum about <type>  s lack of morality basically is just them in the world   they are the only person that matters   and they do n t care if they would get anyone else  s feelings hurt as long as they are being nice and i  ve had this experience with   <type>s myself   they both seem nice people and all   but they kind of lack kindness   or integrty they would fit all <type>  s common stereotypes as very si  s meticulous   fe  s politeness and dead scared of change or new things inferior ne   basically a pleasant atmosphere and in a way they  re kind of making sure they  re making a pleasant atmosphere but that  s about it just surface down deep   they  re not good people   they lack integrity doing the right thing for them is just the selfish ends justifies the means as long as you  re being polite   you can even starve a whole town in africa if you  re doing it in a polite way    ok   that was an exagerated example   but it  s about the point    they do care about their family   the other <type> is a member of my family   a lot kind of   but if you  re outside their family   i have bad news for you you  re going to be used when necessary and it does n t matter if you get a bad deal   they do n t give a damn about your feelings unless you  re part of their family the general lack of integrity as long as it  s polite it ca n t be    morally    bad   that was the general menality of both <type>s   and they genuinely believe that this is sort of a person i would call a mastermind someone who  s being so nice to people yet so basically selfish in their interests do n t care about others  well being just theirs while showing a nice facade and well to those <type>s that was it   it does n t matter if you  re hurting people   are keeping people cofused   are making people lose material assests   are double crossing people   as long as you  re doing it nice you  re morally clean but the thing is   they actually believe they are good people while being just nice   is not a fake for them i was surprised by this   as initially as i  ve red about <type>s i  ve heard they are the  nurturing  type   but that nurturing is kind of limited to family only i was even more surprised they they do n t believe themselves as evil masterminds but in fact are very proud of this   they think they are very good people for being nice all the time like that   and the world is full of bad people who just are n t nice i litterally heard a nice lie is better than truth from the one in my family   yes there are situations where you have to lie and there are situations where you like to gain some advantages while someone else has to suffer being of your lie   it was the second case i m not sure you can expect integrity from them i thought it  s just a case   but i  ve seen plenty of similar cases on the forums   not that all types are clean just that <type> seem to dominate this nice but not kind thing but a strange thing dispite their lack of genuine morality you  re being good with people   people are being good with you people are not being good with you   you have no moral bound to them they do have a niceness morality you  re being nice to people   people have to be nice to you or else they are assholes people are not being nice to you   you were wronged   so obviously i did n t came here at the <type> forum to talk bad things to your face i genuinelly want to know if that  s typical <type> behaviour do you really think that for exmple if you say fuck you   to someone in a nice way you  re morally clean    or does it make it worse    is that a typical <type> behaviour i described above or is it just unhealthy <type>    if so   how does healthy unhealthy <type> manifests and why    what would make an <type> turn from healthy to unhealthy   and how can he be helped to be healthy    
entj,it  s a gander because i do n t know much about ms porter   but i would type her fieldmarshal mobilizer <type> based exclusively on her questioning during congressional hearings mobilizing task forces within government mobilizing leadership hierarchies within government   leader of leaders many of the leaders that she  s leading at the congressional hearings appear to be our friends   the adjudicating guardians    sj    they seem to respect her   which is to be expected for a leader of leaders the problem with fieldmarshals mobilizers    the smart ones   anyway    is that they are rare because leaders need leaders too and fieldmarshals prefer that role more than other types apparently she  s running for california senate in      and i imagine she ought to have success in that pursuit   but politics can be greasy

isfj,hello <type>s   in this interview   i talked to claire and lynda about their similarities and differences as <type>s the stereotype of <type>s working in healthcare is definitely valid as both individuals work in that field the big difference however is with lynda being self above tribe being a jumper <type>    si ti    while claire is tribe above self being the standard <type>    si fe    during the interview   claire talked about being uncomfortable being the centre of attention lynda   however   did n t seem to mind either way as long as she gets to do what she wants we also talked about being an ixxj control freak and lynda talked about making a mess with jello with her kids when they were younger to train herself not to freak out hard when it comes to chaos claire talked about perhaps being the bad cop with her kids because of her lead sf blast nagging them however   both claire and lynda are double deciders and they said ultimately   they want their kids to make their own life decision because they are their own person we also talked about fe shaming people and they said they do n t really do it that much because their ti acts as brakes from going overbearing with doing that claire shared how much she dislikes the idea of people thinking you would be a bad parent if your kid is a troublemaker because you  re different individuals we also discussed their exxp swing and lynda said she is doing it more now as an adult going on trips and cruises and just enjoying life claire said she did that more when she was in college and had a partying phase watch this interview here 
intj,i mean pose on me an interest which i sure do n t have   but do it for yourself that may be one of those things i m good at myself or do n t if such it would still mean then that i really am right there am i asking you to do exactly whatever i would do on myself   excepted that the me that i am is expecting it himself   that further   am i not of no use   as used of   from its use the question is then are you of such use you   yourself more than i am    i call this reducing method by two famous literary names the dickens    for the english people    sand    for the french people    method why and how is it so    why    because for me   and it is confirmatively noted and or explored as such   the first is responsible for having written one of the non so cruelly clear unclear and easy difficult on the mind   lightest literary transcriptions of the killer victim relation   invading step by step the world of temptationed reality in psychic dreams   in fact more really   the most unraw bodily reality   then already psychically anti beauty reality   without a time to do anything reality    see the concept here      then counter impressionistic reality   up until the last conceded moment of the victim   the not so so called heavy moment   is n t it an anti beauty moment was her of his killer   to desacralize completely   to clean up whatever would then be of beauty   against beauty   of such reality    ies      a crime   but not really a crime   in all those ends a crime of a then invisibly forced beauty he simply wrote the most out of facts   psychic   again   most light facts of the crime like still to this day nobody else to ever did it more in any manner than he did for himself there was not an already   only some d j vu   like a programmer screenwriter of a crime tvfilm in the now would merely display luxuriously out of the most simple self kindness too delightful     but incomplete   by itself   still what remains interesting is not the in the now   but the moment how    the second head simply got from the all other way around of the why   if you  re familiar with          i just dare say it well   there is that so make the mic talk   not speak to you tell him about your interests or not   you will be recorded   of course imagine you  re either dickens   either sand    they  re both   supposedly   <type> were would   just be    not    a bit    not    more true    but you then have to be both of them   or neither of both and that i am the method    lone <type> subconscious    it worked   be your classic and unclassic you no use of traditional here feel good   i am i do n t know maybe you  re in the nature of my subconscious   and you may be the killer of this method by the way do you have some advice on making in bold texting in the title section of a thread   i would appreciate it hope you had a great christmas   either passing or celebrating 
intj,here   feel encouraged to ask as many questions on relationships or love or sex or dating with <type>s as you see fit   and we  ll get around to answering as many as our  cold   little robot hearts  can manage laughing remember   though   we  re just here to give advice   it  s up to you to take action wink 
infp,do you sometimes feel like you are being interrogated and that you  re personal space has been intruded on when someone asks you a normal   harmless question or comment    for example   in college   i had a friend who would always point something out about me if i got a new pair of shoes   she would say oh you got a new pair of shoes and then tell me her opinion of them well   i m sure to a lot of people this would just seem normal but for some reason   i felt like i was being interrogated and that my personal space was being invaded i do n t know why i felt that way it might have something to do with the fact that i do n t usually make casual remarks like that about other people and thier appearance of whatever the case may be i guess i feel like it  s none of my business so for example   if someone i know gets a new hairstyle   i most likely wo n t make a comment about it   whether i feel like the hairstyle looks nice or not i usually just keep my opinion to myself 
isfj,i am an <type> p i feel incredibly alone and vulnerable   but no one notices   no one reaches out to hold my heart   and i will likely always be this way   simply because i am not sure i will ever be able to trust anyone at that depth of my heart ever again   even though that  s what i need at the core of who i am god created me for others   but the one that i chose apparently got the memo and chose to betray me at the core of who i am and then poke fun and make light of how i felt   incredulous that anyone could feel like that i am just sick of false advertisement and i am not sure i will ever find someone outside of this relationship when or if it ever ends   because unlike others   i take vows seriously
isfp,well i have a male <type> friend that share a group of friends with me for some years   he was a bit distantat the start but got closer with everyone over the time recently i  ve been having mixed feelings about him and i may have developed romantic feelings for him   i am an <type> so i overthink a lot and it took a really long time for me to figure out my feelings well recently i decided to take things slowly but i really want to show my feelings and try to get to the next level but i find his behavior a bit weird for me to understand   recently sometimes i found him oversharing some things    things he did n t use to do    and getting close   even a bit clingy on the other hand sometimeshe will feel only distant from me from the group    online and irl      he will ignore me but later will try to talk and be friendly and close   these things did n t used to happen so i think he may know that i started to try getting closer    or maybe not       i would like to add that one of the things that holds me back is that i do n t wanna try to force things until it gets strange and it may ruin the friendship so i would like to ask for people that may understand if someone could give me some insight 
isfj,anybody <type> here that have relationship with <type>    my boyfriend is an <type> and sometimes we have our problem that mostly about fe or extrovert feeling   as an <type> i feel so hard to understand anyone  s feeling and sometimes i m not sensitive enough to use some    maybe    appropriate manner to other meanwhile especially for <type> it  s very important also in relationship <type> likes to play victim card a lot and require me to understand what they feel and use  feeling  too win the fight and again for me it  s like please do n t force me to use  feel  so   can i get some advice how to deal with <type>    
isfj,i have some <type>s in my life who i love but some of the things they do and say drive me insane   often to the point where even though i love them i strongly dislike the way they behave for example   my mother is an <type> i know she loves me   but she  s suffocating me she has me wrapped up in cotton wool   and whenever i try and tell her i m capable of looking after myself   she gets very upset and tells me  she  s just showing that she cares  i appreciate that she cares   and i tell her this   but i would like her to appreciate that i ca n t be happy without my independence i may live at home   but i am a grown women          it gets worse when she  s stressed she  ll suddenly take on a whole new personality when i was a little girl    about seven    i used to describe her to my friends as  good mom  and  bad mom  good mom was loved to laugh   and kindly corrected me if i did something wrong i was a very good girl   and anything i did wrong was completely unintentional bad mom was completely irrational if i accidentally did something wrong   something good mom would normally laugh about   bad mom would scream at me or hit me of course   she does n t hit me anymore   but the screaming has gotten worse only recently have i been standing up for myself   telling her that there  s no rational reason for her to be acting this way   that it  s unfair for her to take her stress out on me when i  ve done nothing wrong if i make a logical   valid argument      and do n t get me wrong   i m always polite about it      she either slams the door in my face and walks out   or uses the  i m so tortured card     i m so stressed   and you  re not   but you are adding to my stress in some indirect way   therefore i have every right to scream at you    and the worst part    she goes on for hours   sometimes even days   and the entire  argument  can usually be summed up into a single paragraph she just rewords and repeats until she  s left breathless and when she  s out of breath    she sulks   and snaps   and ignores me i feel like it makes her feel a little bit better if she can make everyone feel as miserable as she feels it does n t make any sense because i am very   very careful never to do anything wrong i always try to be polite   honest   modest   gentle   helpful   kind everything a daughter should be her argument for her actions are usually something along the lines of  i m stressed because you have n t cleaned the bathroom this week  she has never asked me to clean the bathroom in my life how should i know    so then i  ll offer a compromise of course   i  ll go and it now   how about i start doing it once a week from now on    but that  s never what she wants to hear she  ll reply with something like  it  s too late now   i  ve already done it i wanted it done yesterday then why did n t she tell me yesterday    because i should have thought to be helpful on my own accord   of course   and so the argument goes round in circles basically   how do i deal with the irrational   emotional side of this <type> without moving out    because i know moving out right now would break her heart   but i have to do something i do not get depressed or upset easily   but my mother leaves me awake crying at night and that  s something not many <type>s can admit to she is the only person to make me cry in the past    years    besides a breakup with a boyfriend   years ago      and somehow she constantly manages to depress me i need to find a way to deal with her   or i  ll have to leave can anyone help

intp,for the first time ever   scientists at the university of rochester have found one of the reasons our brain needs sleep to survive turns out   when we sleep   our brain takes that time to clean out the build up of brain junk we accumulate during our waking hours sleep is pretty much necessary for our body s mental street cleaners to come out and do their work when cells do their daily cell type work   they produce waste product the rest of the body has this waste cleared out by the lymphatic system   but the brain is disconnected from that   so it needs another way to wipe out the waste the brain has it s own garbage men   carried on the waves of cerebrospinal fluid   who surf the leftovers straight down to your liver for elimination as it turns out   the brain s garbage men move twice as fast when you re sleeping   because your neurons shrink by half   making the fluid channels wider this study shows that the brain has different functional states when asleep and when awake   said u of r researcher maiken nedergaard in fact   the restorative nature of sleep appears to be the result of the active clearance of the by products of neural activity that accumulate during wakefulness 
entp,hey guys i was wondering if you had any experience with meditation or meditative form of prayer i have mentioned before that i am entering the seminary soon and planning to be a priest and i talk about my feelings about structure in my religion counter to my <type> nature i find my ne and ti present in my writting and discussions but when it comes to mass prayer and other areas i am very structured i use mindfulness meditate daily   i practice meditative christian prayer    centering prayer    and i participate in the liturgy of the hours and am developing the discipline of a monk in these actions however once the monk takes of his robes i am a smart ass wild man and a typical <type> do any of you <type>s have a meditative or prayer scheduled or just meditate every now and then or do you at all    what has your experience been

estj,hello <type>s   in this interview   i got a chance to talk to ashlee about what it  s like to be an <type> te ne pb c    s    ff despite the fact we have the exact same animal stack   ashlee and i were still very different thanks to the difference in our function stack ashlee talked about how difficult it is for her to express what she likes and what she does n t like she talked about planning her wedding and letting others decide what cake she will get   what kind of dress   etc her fiance    officially typed as an <type> si fi sb p    c    mf    is helping her use her fi to decide for herself who she wants to come as the bridesmaids ashlee also talked about it  s easier to do things for other people and she likes solving people related problems with others thanks to her nt play ashlee said she had trouble seeing her blast at first because her blast is double feminine and actually had an easier time seeing her consume because it  s double masculine she talked about finding inspiration every time she experiences something new which goes to show how she  s very exxpish as a jumper <type> she feels baffled that other types ca n t double observe because she thinks the balance between ne and si is not as difficult as te and fi ashlee also talked about her hulk syndrome when the masculine fi swing comes and she stops caring for other people    in the moment    and just focuses on herself watch this interview here 
infj,it  s interesting that alot of people chalk this up to the <type> simply being a coward   or being obsessed at people pleasing <type>s prefer to avoid conflict because of the empathetic nature of our fe we do n t try and avoid conflict simply just for the sake of harmony or to please people we try to avoid it to protect ourselves what people do n t understand is that as <type>s   we feel everything not only do we feel our emotions   we feel your emotions too when there is conflict   not only do we have to deal with our own strong emotions   we also have to deal with absorbing and feeling your emotions as well this is like being in a boxing fight   and while you are taking damaging blows from your competitor   you are always feeling in your own body every blow that you land on him that is the reality of conflict through an <type> on the outside for most it may appear as cowardice or people pleasing   but it is anything but avoiding conflict is simply a survival mechanism if an <type> chooses to engage in conflict   then something must have really pushed them over the edge because for us getting into a fight or conflict is twice as intense as it is for most people 
intp,i seem to be very good at it i make very sensible bets and so far have lost      but won over     i usually bet in play   during games   and spot little flaws in the thinking of the admins of the site i  ve been around a lot of gamblers who seem to think i m just lucky   but they throw away hundreds and silly bets and are tempted by the potential winnings 
infp,hello everyone   i m new here i decided to join the forums to hopefully get some opinions on something that  s been going around my mind for some time edited out for privacy reasons too many details so the deal is while i try to come to terms with my own issues   is this behaviour normal for <type>s    what  s your take    i m obviously not asking people to guess what he  s thinking   but i m very much confused 
estp,i m a    year old college student and an <type> i have started to get feelings towards my male <type> friend and i m not sure what to do about it he is very outgoing   kind and always the life of the party i feel very calm and peaceful when i m around him because he is always looking for fun stuff to do and does n t stress about life like i do and overthink and analyze everything he  s a bit of a man whore    not judging people who like to hook up live your life    but he has mentioned how he might want something more at some point he  s always been super sweet to me and gotten me out of the house when i m in one of my what is life moods and i feel we really have a strange connection and understanding even though we are so different he is athletic and outgoing and involved in so much and i m kind of a cliche <type> who loves to read and write and do artsy stuff    i do like to go out and live it up too but not quite to the same extent         i love to think about people and feelings and can talk for hours about life but he is n t very into that kind of stuff and just prefers to stick to reality and do exciting things in the real world he has flirted with me but i m not sure if he means anything by it   we are good friends and he kind of flirts with everyone i do n t want to ruin a great friendship that has brought so much excitement into my life but i ca n t stop thinking about him and i do n t feel this way very often i m just afraid if we start something he would get bored of me and leave me heartbroken and this friendship would be done for good do you think it  s a disaster waiting to happen if an <type> and <type> date    how do you <type>s feel about <type>s    
enfp,what questions would you like to ask your future self if you were to meet them    if you don t want to ask them any questions   would you be interested in conversing with them at all    why or why not    sent from my iphone using tapatalk
infj,is anybody here into astrology    while i see many people typing the capricorn personality as xstj i disagree with this i believe they best represent the <type> capricorns are called old souls they are considered very wise and have a melancholic aura to them they are said to be very mature as children and become youthful in spirit as they age this all sounds <type> capricorn would also correlate to enneagram type   which is one of the most common <type> enneagram types many say scorpio would be <type> but i think scorpio is way too anti social   erotic and undisciplined to be an <type> yes scorpio  s definitely use ni but the amount of paranoia and insanity they exhibit is more characteristic of ni that is in the tertiary or inferior position scorpio  s are xstp  s in my opinion capricorns are said to be very compatible with scorpios could this be the xnfj xstp shadow dynamic at work    half the descriptions i read make capricorns out to be these hard headed ceo  s which sounds stj but those descriptions are too superficial the following gives more insight into a cap and sounds very <type> especially in the bolded places many astrologers consider capricorn to be the most enigmatic and mysterious sign of the zodiac all of the cardinal signs indicate seats of power and in a creature with the forelimbs of a goat attached to the tail of a fish   the abyss of the ocean is combined with mountainous terrain this represents a  cross of matter  between the psyche and its manifestation in the material   drawing the soul out of its collective stupor to confront the challenges of reality and individualism the ocean   besides symbolizing primordial roots   relates to instinctive wisdom   secrets   and knowledge that lies buried within the depths of consciousness capricorn   bearing only the tail of an aquatic creature   keeps a head that is free from impressionable thought at a rational level capricorns are affected only by what they can define through logic and reasoned assessment   but unconsciously   spiritually and emotionally they draw from the deep this is a sign that is anything but shallow and superficial beneath the capricorn  s cool   reserved and calculating exterior lies a profound resource of emotional strength   psychic resilience and earthy endurance the recognizable character traits of the sign reveal compulsion   dedication and perseverance in its aims and interests capricorns may not impress others by their motivation but neither do they seek the easy approval or widespread attention of others their ambitions in relationships   career and personal growth are rooted in an  inner  motivation that runs too deep to be easily shaken their strengths    and their faults    are based upon the qualities of stamina   fortitude   staying power and survival some see the capricorn  s scaly tail as that of the sea serpent   a creature of  old knowledge    wise in matters of the occult and offering a potential for understanding beyond limited   earthly experience capricorns are known for being  older than their years  and those who take up the study of mysteries and traditions gravitate towards a masterly knowledge of their craft just as the business minded capricorn will gravitate towards the managerial position mastery and power are the understated keywords of this sign even the earthy aspect of the goat is frequently underestimated in its potential for symbolising hidden reserves of strength click to expand 
isfp,hello everybody     thank you for looking at my post recently i got carried away studying sp types and was surprised how many of my favorite male characters are <type> i am   by the way   <type> girl now i m in search of at least one real <type>   we could exchange our experience in studying mbti   find out how your second se and my tertiary will connect and just have fun chatting   thank you for your attention   write to me definitely     
istp,makes my blood boil   why the hell people do n t just say what they mean
enfj,so   i have tested <type> over and over i have also tested equal  s on enneagram   over and over i was recently asked how does this work    how can you be <type> and an      this was a fair question   and i intend on answering it   but it is complicated and some of it is too intimate for me to just discuss openly my reluctance made me turn to co workers and friends people who have known me for a year or more the over all consensus was that   really fits when showed them <type> they also heartily agreed i asked them ok logically   this should not work i can see it   my co workers can see it   but it seem that i need help explaining it to someone else one very basic comparison that would like to start with is <type>s are externally focused   introspective   altruistic   positive and have excellent people skills they place utmost importance on helping others grow they are warm and have a natural desire to be supportive and encouraging being charismatic and possessing excellent language skills   they do well in leadership roles <type>s strive to enhance the lives of their human brethren eights are attracted to and appreciate power they desire to be strong   independent   straightforward   assertive persons   who use their strength and influence to make the world a more just place to live in they value equity   the equal distribution of power   and show a concern for the underprivileged and disenfranchised being your own person   doing your own thing   protecting your own is what life is all about i could be wrong   but i do not feel that these are mutually exclusive i think   enhances and deepens some of the more primal warrior esque tendencies sides of <type> i understand that i should be a   or   or something more squishy yummy    but i seem to be the vibrant   bouncing ball of molten lava with a smile on my face are there any <type>  s out there who have an enneagram number that seems to be contradictory    or any other <type>s who can see the correlation between   and <type> like i can    thank you
enfj,i had my ass spanked when i was a child and i turned out quite well i am pro spanking and have my reasons   but what do you think    reinforcement and punishment both work independently   as well as together   as part of a behavior plan positive reinforcement works exceedingly better and faster than punishment punishment should be used when necessary this is behavior modifaction     it  s a science i approach most things as a science even when dealing with humans especially dealing with humans 
infp,in one of my latest post i describe how <type>s have a special relationship with fiction we heal because of it we love to invent imaginary world often very young for exemple in my case i began to write when i had my first video game and start using word to make original character at the age of   it was very primitive and a copy and paste of the scenario of the video game i played it actually carry every thematic my dense alternative world now represents parralels world   love   existential problems   heroism i know i create my world because things in my family were actually painful i remember one time waking up with the feeling my family were robots a thematic present in my writing the place of others   determinism   virtual reality why specially <type>s    thats the question i want to know the answer are all fp inclined to like art fiction    it strikes me that fiction is present in all my life because i study a lot of psychology and it seems i dont make science like others fjs tps there is an artistic and aesthetic dimension but above all the role of fiction is actually extremely important in occident science has been separated from fiction because we often say that reality and fiction are not compatible but fiction and metaphor are linked you get motivated by specific topics   it changes your values etc so why us <type> are linked to fiction    what can it represent for non <type>s    
isfp,tell me what <type> stereotypes you have heard of this is in no way an attack on <type>  s this thread just gives awareness to the stereotypes of the <type> personality here is my list of <type> stereotypes      artistic      rebellious      animal lovers      caring of others      too serious      romantic      loners      overly sensitive      very kind       pushover
enfp,this is for entertainment purposes only i want us to come here and post random thoughts about general stuff this is not a rant rave thread this is not intended to hint to someone else about anything or send out anonymous messages have fun with this   i  ll go first today      p m i wonder why every time i paint my nails i have to go to the bathroom it never fails i always have on something that requires zipping too   ha ha dry today   ish p m i am impressed that the really short   little lady drives that big ass tow truck and she drives fast too odd 
enfj,i need help deciding if i m an <type> or an <type>   what do you like to think about    and what do you like to do    i m not sure what i like thinking about besides mbti and the universe   how we came here   and why we exist i wonder about it a lot   with religion and stuff   which is why i m agnostic things i like to do are writing stories    but i always end up never surpassing the first chapter because i don t think it s good enough      listening to music   feeling busy    even though i m really lazy at home and don t do anything      what are your biggest fears    i seriously fear dying like what happens after death    do you just die and that s it    i want to impact people before i die so that way if i just die and that s it   at least people will remember me for things i ve accomplished i don t understand how some people don t fear death   because i do a lot or how they don t wonder where we come from or why we exist or why things work the way they do   what do you feel responsible for    i feel like i have this responsibility to be a good daughter   have good grades   etc my parents are strict   and they want me to have a high gpa   have all as   etc right now   i have a     and all my grades are as except for precalc and physics    though i have finals tomorrow so this can change    but there s this responsibility to be what they want me to be vs who i want to be i feel like i m constantly struggling with this choosing to submit to them or be myself   what makes you happy    i m not sure i don t feel happy i can get excited and stuff   but i m not sure i don t think i ve been genuinely happy since  th grade so i can t really answer that question   do you like to help others    why    i love helping others i want to make an impact on people very badly like when i m at my job   taking customers orders   delivering food to them that makes me feel worthwhile and that i m helping them compared to when they put me on dining room   i always ask to switch to a different position because it s boring and i don t feel like i m helping others i always like feeling busy and accomplished   compared to my other friends   who like to just feel relaxed   what do you do with your emotions    depends i think my emotions are pretty visible on my face i guess i d say i feel them   though with my parents   i m very stoic with them because of how strict they are were   do you have values    which    my main values are being kind   not being racist   homophobic   things of that nature idk why   but i m    and a junior in high school   and i m pretty flexible on things   but my values are somehow debatable with others    like ableism i tell people the r word is a slur   and they ll still continue to say it and say i was the problem when i unfriend them or when i tell my friend that hating other poc is racist and they get all mad because i unfriend them like it makes no sense when i first found out people were ableist or homophobic   i debated on unfriending them because i didn t want to lose them   but now   i don t really give a shit either i ll unfriend them or just let the friendship die if we re not close i don t understand how people can still be friends with people who are homophobic and whatnot   what do you consider before making a decision    i like to hear others opinions before making a decision i ll go around asking friends for their opinions or i ll look online at reviews   videos   etc and gather intel before making a decision i do this a lot   like pretty much      if many people say it s good   then i ll try it and see how it works for me   what are your wishes or goals in life    i want to be famous   but not super famous   just known a little bit i want to inspire people and make others think of me in a good light i want to be talented in many areas over the summer   i want to maybe start learning japanese since i already know three languages   english   spanish   and jamaican patois i do wish to be happy though   but that s kind of unattainable since happiness isn t permanent   but only temporary    do you think it  s important to live in society    idk it s your life people can choose what they wanna do to live   then yeah   but the word society can vary depending on how one chooses to look at the word    they are spreading false rumors and gossip about you how do you feel about it and what would you do    i d be pissed and wonder why they did it i probably wouldn t confront them   unless they were my friend otherwise   i would just be pissed and wonder what others think of me now    would you change hide your opinion to fit into society    depends on the topic if it s something i care deeply about   then no i usually kind of express my opinion on how i feel about things regardless   unless i feel self conscious and i m burdening others or people think i m weird then i ll just change my opinion so others won t think i m being weird    someone is making fun of you publicly what would you do in this situation    if it s my friend   i laugh it off   but might feel a little insecure if it s someone i don t know   i ll probably remain quiet and shrink up and i won t really say or do anything    what do you think feel about the future    i m not sure i don t really think of it that much maybe it will be better hopefully the closest i get to thinking about it is what my life will be like and how i ll be    what irritates you    depends on the situation ngl i feel like for many questions   it depends on the situation   so there s no clearcut answer but things that usually irritate me are throat noises people make when their throat itches   sniffling   excessive nose blowing   things like that    how do you see yourself    sarcastic   insecure   imaginative   naive   shy   loud   outspoken   bold    what would be an ideal world for you    a society where we all live in harmony a society where slavery   racism   colonization never existed we would all have our original languages and cultures instead of being forced into new ones there would be no hate   but only love    is the object    external facts    or the subject    internal opinions and assumptions    more important to you    probably external facts    do you look for meaning in life internally or externally    probably externally   since i look outward for answers about what meaning means 
isfp,right where to begin i met an <type> girl and she has either brought out the <type> in me or made me hate the <type> in me we went out and i felt like an <type> she broke things off and now i feel like an <type> but i hate the feeling either way she  s fucked up my fi and i feel very shitty very intensely at times and i ca n t control my feelings a year ago i took many tests and    of the time   out of like    tests i was typed as an <type>   i even bought please understand me   and yeah <type> lately   over the past   months i  ve been feeling different   very emotional and so i took the test again in the book <type> <type> took a   are you an <type> or <type> test and was <type> i then realised that   holy shit   of course i m an <type> what a fucking idiot i  ve been all this time    but then i read descriptions and the   you know you  re a xxxx when    threads and well i related to the <type> the most and i just ca n t decide at times i  ll realise that i m an se user but feel like i would prefer to have ne instead and then when i think i m an <type> i would think    shit   you live in the moment   you want to live in the moment and you do you little bastard   decide already what your type is      i  ll be honest i m a bit of a lost soul at times   definitely a p definitely a fi dominant i think i might be an <type> because the <type> uses the same functions and the tests recognised those functions in me but in the wrong order or am i an <type> but just been fucked up by this girl    what do you think    i  ll tell you more if the info is n t enough

using this thread for a few reasons one to share my ideas on god and how i come up with my thoughts and second   since this is a personality site   to show how someone with high intuition connects stuff and comes up with different ideas and concepts how to see the bigger picture hint knowing the power of the question of course   i ll found that so many of my ideas i came up with all on my own   well it seems that somewhere at sometime someone has came up with it too   or piece of it i feel a little let down and disappointed bc i like it when i thought up of something that no one else has but at the same time i feel it s a sign that i m on the right track   at least from the perspective that someone somewhere has had the exact same thought concepts as me without ever been taught or directed in a certain thought or way   learning that i m not the only one at random kinda powerful sometimes this thread will be on going leave stories   connections or ideas if you want but pm me if it is smth you want to discuss in this thread i will give parts at a time of my ideas and concepts   explaining them also i will also post stories on how i came to be on the road   my experiences   my interactions relating to this spiritual journey the connections first   i want to give my personality type and some background so if you are reading bc you are learning about functions particularly the ni and ne you may see the connections maybe    anyway   i m an <type> but my younger self was typed as <type> i find my f vs t is very close they still flip flop a little however   my dom goal in life is to understand myself completely but i do this in a very analytical way which the whole purpose is to find the cosmic truth of human life and where what why how i fit which will seems very scientific way of looking at stuff   kinda at first   well you ll see it s very <type> i use an <type> approach to finding my true destiny which is the ultimate goal which is very <type> the intensive is so driven in me i really have no other real focus in life even as a child    well   i have a job and take care of myself   love learning so i do meet a lot of ppl but this is always driven me   my subconscious never turns off looking for these answers    also in my tri thingys     the visionary well my   is main my   is close with   and followed by       and   equally i sometimes get     also my sp is always equal with my sx idk much about this stuff but after discovery i m a           the sx described me better with that tri type i take a percentage of my   functions about every   months they are usually similar every time   a few very small differences highest to lowest    retook the test   days ago    current ni    ne    fi    note my fi is usually in between the two nx and they all always within     of each other   which they are all within   this time   too update my ne has been highest         ok   so i will start this with a video bc it sets the stage i just found this video last week and didn t know this about einstein but im definitely about the cosmos   stage   i knew he believe in a god kinda just didn t know how similar we are in that way esp with the church god   for me   they offered no spiritual growth just dos and donts anyway   this isn t about tearing down anyone s beliefs    as far as i m certain   if what you believe in makes you a better person   makes you want to get up and live your life then who am i to say what is wrong or right for you      but i will probably mention my issues with stuff this is just my theories i will try to write soon in the next post which will be part   of a snapshot on my view on god connections personality types msmojimoe said post    click to expand msmojimoe said post    click to expand msmojimoe said post    click

esfj,there are   matches for an <type> and i  ve changed my mind i previously thought <type> was the best match for an <type> but now i believe it is <type> and let me tell you why <type> and <type> are most compatible with <type> and <type> briefly   each nickname is as follows <type> the artist   the aesthete   the adventurer   the artisan   the dancer <type> the child   the daydreamer   the quester   the poet   the idealist <type> the teacher   the coach   the protagonist   the guru   the giver   the mentor <type> the nanny   the consul   the shadow   the advice giver   the protector   the provider   the supporter   the bodyguard here  s what i m thinking the <type>    child    goes naturally with the <type>    nanny    and the <type>    dancer    goes best with the <type>    coach    plus   the <type> and <type> share si in common and the <type> and <type> share se in common so i think its better to have the senses of the past and present in harmony with each other maybe you are an <type> and disagree and if so there are   other options which is your favorite    <type> or this one that says all   <type> a <type> b <type> c <type> d <type>
istp,this goes out to the <type> christians on this forum i accepted christ at age   and from the age of    to the present   i  ve been all over the place with christianity i  d go into detail   but i m on my phone if you need the details   i  ll hop online later and give them i  ve reached a point now   where i truly desire to live according to god  s word i believe jesus is the only way i can be saved and i accept him into my heart my problem lies in that   the deeper i think about christianity   the more i wonder if my belief is true christians always ask the question   if you were to die tonight   are you     sure you  d go to heaven    and when i think about it   i ca n t even picture heaven i ca n t see myself standing face to face with jesus or standing before god in judgement heck   i ca n t even see myself dying i live so much in the moment   it  s hard for me to grasp any past or future and it  s not like i believe anything else   like evolution   the big bang etc i just ca n t honestly say i can grasp the concept wrap my mind around god being out there watching me right   now so i m stuck between belief and    doubt       it  s really bothering me because i want to have a genuine belief   but i ca n t reason it into existence and i do n t even know if the belief i have is false to begin with also   when i get really involved with church   i almost feel like i m in a dream or something like none of this is real and i m just gonna wake up and go back to a normal life where all i m concerned about is mechanics   thrill seeking and the thought of death never occurs to me it  s weird the more i think   the more confused i become i tried talking to the college pastor at my church and he tried to help me   but he drew some blanks because my   thoughts were so deep i guess he did n t really look that deep into the topic before also the bible preaches   to keep your focus things of heaven   not on things of the earth and it preaches to follow it  s scripture   but he more i focus on heaven and following scripture   i ca n t seem to function in day to day life anymore and i feel bogged down by rules and regulations i know    from what i  ve read and my own experience    we <type>  s tend to have trouble believing in things we ca n t see and looking into the future how did you overcome this struggle and accept christianity as a reality    or did you even have this struggle

isfp,i stole this from the <type>s and the <type>s we  ll see how it takes off here so   <type>s   spill the beans   confess as many or as few things as you want     sometimes i doubt i  ll ever have the selflessness commitment to be in a close friendship or a relationship   but i m starting to accept that i have to make an effort with people sometimes   instead of just assuming someone does n t like me and distancing myself   i feel so boring and avoidant    which i am    atm   like a broken record i do n t feel like i m living   masks might be painted in elaborate swirling detail   but the real thing is so much richer your turn

<type> <type> michael coz <type>     points <type>    points <type>    points me self typing myself when learned about cognitive functions me as a baby i cried a lot me as a kid puberty always

somebody  s attention me at school more focused on playing baseball with friends or videogames than actual girls dating so shy i was unable to tell the girls i liked them i was so reserved some crazy girls did me what they call sexual harassment they grabbed my buttocks and yelled in class how in love they were with me    which   of course   was more to annoy me than to flirt with me    me at college sit at the back of the classroom nervous while speaking in front of class as soon as class finished   i reached home me at work late arriving    although the schedule is flexible since it is i love to annoy a small group of people   but in a childishly offensive manner i want to annoy you a little without offending you i rebelled once again against my boss    i ignored him    and told his boss i would quit when i finished my duties his boss sent me a meeting   and i declined   stating that it was not necessary to talk this latter boss      levels above me in evp level    sent me a meeting and told me he cancelled a meeting to speak with me   so i ended up lowering my anger and accepting the meeting if i like you   i do n t tell you i annoy you if i hate you   i treat you very seriously people just say   ah   it  s just my name   when i do something they find weird i hate bosses who abuse those with less power    not fair    i tend not to speak with bosses or vps   although i find more joy talking with the lowest level analysts and helping them learn something i tend to say i would be a bad teacher because i do n t have the patience   but people tend to say i m good at explaining things i prefer my subordinates to do the talking while i keep analyzing things i procrastinate a lot i always crack a joke in the middle of a serious or non serious topic    it takes me longer to be promoted   though    i get angry at rules or situations where people are closed minded i hate politics and find it stupid when people prioritize high ranking bosses over anyone else i m so much requested outside work hours so i prefer to turn off my work phone than accepting the call and tell them to fuck off i have changed my personal phone number several times now nobody from work can call me on that number and i can rest i cannot see something wrong without my mind trying to find a solution i do n t talk that much just burst of time me at home i m the oldest brother   so i try to behave more appropriately me out there alone reversed do n t show my goofiness me out there with close people i display my goofiness to friends   whether people watch or not i enjoy making people embarrassed but despise being embarrassed myself    hypocritical social anxiety    love life sucks i m kind of not that ugly   but i feel so tired of going out and meeting new women i m worried that if i get married   i wo n t be able to buy my favorite gadgets    i love gadgets    i flirt by doing stupid things like making silly faces at the girl or asking stupid things i never pick up on women  s signs women end up telling me they like me   or some friend of hers tells me health i m on an ssri for social anxiety for the fourth time i always quit on my own when symptoms relapse i m a little hypochondriac me in general i have compulsive behaviors   which i relieve with emotional shopping and eating    i m on a   k usd bad debt right now    i m a perfectionist i make hasty decisions and keep ruminating about whether other options are better for my ocp type i doubt myself a lot i feel terrible fear on rollercoasters i m afraid of flying and car speeds i distract very easily when

child who likes minions   pok mon   making people laugh with silly behavior   and making sfw   non sexual   non derogatory   and non offensive jokes i want to annoy you   but not hurt you i suppress my emotions with fun and jokes and try to divert the topic i hate anger   sadness   and every strong emotion   and i hate showing them to people i m not an organized person i try to avoid debates or discussions because something inside me wants to say something   but after that   i want out of the discussion because i m a little anxious or get involved in the heat i prefer to hear people debating i have much creativity and intelligence but am too lazy to keep focused or finish something my brain skips between thoughts on different topics instead of going in sequence ex i m writing a letter   but before i write the last part   i remember i need to fix a backend service for a colleague i end up leaving the mail in draft and sending it days later people laugh when i make a mistake they find me funny even when i m not joking my brain absorbs every problem   even the ones i need to resolve   and i blame myself for the problem ex mom is arguing with my brother i must fix it i tend not to look at problems   so my mind wo n t hurry to fix them i am afraid of making a mistake   and when i do it   i feel ashamed   and it bothers me a lot i say i don t care about what others say or think about me   but i do a little ssri makes it easier to ignore overthinking is my best friend   and benzos doesn t like it i have a playful   fun side with people i feel close to or with people who haven t yelled at me when there are no bodies around at work   i do feel lonely i prefer a few people around that let me in peace but keep close enough i m good at brainstorming solutions for problems i create due to procrastinating people tag me as different or crazy people say there s no way i m an introvert because i m very fun and smart part of the exception is it workers who know how to communicate with people social pressure can make me spit ideas   and the good ones need to be filtered i m more preoccupied with the future i can be easily distracted from what i m doing because my interest has been piqued by something else or because somebody has stopped by to say hi i have periods when i m social   fanciful   and impulsive those times are usually followed by quite a bit of downtime and quiet introspection i take things personally i like to watch or listen to heated discussions   and sometimes i start them i m not that into reading books i m more visual i try to read people  s faces before trying to softly annoy them people at work like to include me in interviews because i m good at reading people i hate authority and have had problems with people three levels up in the company where i work nothing disrespectful just when my emotions can no longer be held i just exploded in a crazy   sarcastic way people seem to love me more than i love myself when i m at the store i prefer to spend time looking for the thing that asking for help finding it unless i m in a hurry i hate to be hurried i constantly try to improve things even at the expense of spending my money or time i always said when x it will be perfect and i will settle that momento never comes so i keep repeating the cycle never resting i feel curious about people who are reserved   mostly women i enjoy the behavior of some <type> fictional characters the joker    i like to watch bad people burn like c levels from my job      iron man    quick brainstorming   sense of humor   good but self absorbed      jack sparrow    good disguised as weird      i tend to finish lunch at work and visit another small group of people i know and bother them or make them laugh i love gengar and deadpool making fun of things i won t ask for help when needed   but eventually will let my pride lose so minions can work on the boring part exception at work because i m a manager i try to do everything by myself almost always   and subordinates complaints about me doing it at work when at home and on weekends   i shut off the social button and close myself in my bubble i hate super crowded spaces and loud noises thank god for noise canceling earbuds i dress like a hippie mother hates that i went to my brother  s prom in crocs   and mom turned into karen when i m down emotionally   i don t want people around me when i m not social   i don t want people around me i second guess myself a lot on big decisions i like birds i m very pessimistic i tend to get surprised when i say i can only do    and end up doing     
esfp,ah   yes another thread for the <type>  s we already know what the personality description says about the <type>   but how do people really see them    you have to be     honest it does not matter if you are right or wrong both positive and negative comments appreciated i tend to see most <type>  s as fun loving and easy going they do n t think before they do stuff impulsive   but always entertaining they usually know the right thing to say they are n t that bright   but they  ve got such good people skills and good charisma that it does n t matter it  s hard to connect with them on a deeper level   they do n t seem to like talking about things that are more in depth they  ve got so many friends and so many people feel like they connect with the <type> <type>  s sometimes come off as shallow they are always in the middle of the crowd they like to have a good laugh they do n t mind being human lab rats for their friends latest idea or experiment overall   they are really cool people to talk to and be around what is everyone else  s input on the <type> personality type

infj,this will be a simple and easy way to get things off your chest without losing your cool or sounding like a whiny little piece cheese the purpose of this thread is for you to write letters to people or things that will never get to read them sounds stupid    probably dry but at least you can say what needs to be said without being judged for the contents of your letter and have some anonymous person out there in the world actually give a damn wink also   i did n t want to limit this thread to only <type>s but i have a feeling we  ll need it the most crazy so be serious    or not    just have fun with it   darlings   i  ll start dear smoothie girl   i think you might have slipped a bit of alcohol into my strawberry banana smoothie and although i cannot stand the taste or smell of liquor   i thank ye kindly for it and will smile extra nicely at you the next time we meet sincerely   an <type>
esfp,help help help   i desperately need help dealing with a manipulative <type> in my life to start off i am an <type> and he is an <type> i m not sure how to handle the situation because i have n t figured out <type>  s yet i  d love the point of view of an <type>   his motto seems to be   i do n t trust i will get what i need   so i will give myself every advantage he has manipulated me to the point where he controls everything i do he believes he has total control over me    which he does    he believes i will do whatever he wants   if he asks the right way    which is true    nothing i do is good enough for him i am never acknowledged when i please him either plus he  s cheated on me multiple times    but i ca n t reveal my sources so i was never able to confront him about it    but sadly   i m still attracted to him you are all too charming and i always fall for this type he knew i wanted someone to care about me and he faked it to get what he wanted out of me thankfully i  ve realized that he is not healthy for me i want out   i  ve tried to leave many times i cut off all communication with him that led to begging and pleading when i did n t give in   he resorted to emotional blackmail he just makes me feel as if i am obligated to stay with him and it works which obviously drew me back in and now i am stuck i m just going in a circle i  ve tried to buy as much time as possible but enough is enough for me its as if he  s saying   you  re no good   but i  ll do everything in my power to keep you in my life i realize i am only adding to the fire when i respond to him   but not responding clearly did n t work i am the type to be super direct and confrontational i explain why i am doing certain things and how it will be beneficial to the both of us he is only worried about what will make him happy right now so everything i tell him goes in through one ear and out the other so my question to all you <type>  s out there in a perfect world   how would you like to be dumped    i know it  s a strange question   but think about it a way that would stop you from contacting me continuously and still feel satisfied with the end of the relationship    please help me                             i really appreciate it   is anyone willing to share their experience    how they got out of a manipulative relationship    i  d love to know how you did it     there must be a formula of some type some way to get rid of him for some reason i  ve involved my emotions for the first time in my life this is one situation i ca n t get myself out of i hate feelings ugh thank you thank you   
esfp,dating an <type> for almost two months has been challenging but there  s also psychological understanding and attraction between us so it is n t one sided when we talk about hobbies   arts   and places it can be extremely comfortable and enjoyable however   i m not truly sure if this young man wants to be serious with me we are only in our early twenties and i do n t have that much experience in the dating world except with this young <type> who has at least   lovers before me he told me that he wanted to consider me as his wife unless i fulfilled his criteria which obviously has to be about looks and body i told him that these are superficial things and that in the end   looks will merely fade i understand it can be an important factor especially if he is truly visual and i m sure even without me   he can get another lady if he desires to if he had someone with whom he went out before and he is comparing me with those women   then i just do n t understand the idea of him being with me if he knows i ca n t satisfy his wishes sometimes if i can recall   at least we clashed but manage to forgive each other until there will be another conflict if we are already like this during dating   i do n t know if marriage is the best solution since it wo n t be the same usually   dating is supposed to be easier   i thought well   not in this relationship lol i was anticipating this relationship to last long term and i know i should n t expect anything too much   but after going through hardships i had a chance to move on and not fall for another heartbreak if marriage is uttered in his tongue   i believe he wants to respect me and be frank about the situation so   i m not sure why he always cancels our plan if we want to have a date and talk about serious matters oh   i do n t know we  ll see

esfp,hello <type>s   in this interview   i got a chance to talk to candice about what it  s like to be an <type> se te pb s    c    ff one of the questions i asked candice is what it  s like to be the rare consume last <type> having double activated ni and double activated blast she said she did notice she has trouble trying new things unless she gets pressure from the tribe candice  s blast is apparent when she talks about being a serial entrepreneur and having sold a business before and loves starting new ones she  s a doer having saviour st play and double activated blast candice also talks about her double feminine play to double masculine sleep swing she will be nice and flexible with people but the feeling of resentment starts building up and she ends up blowing up on people the analogy i used is like taking a can of pop and shaking it until it blows up when someone opens it a little candice also talked about having trouble planning with her ni at the bottom    even if it  s double activated    and talks about her fear of ghosts and being alone watch this interview here 
istj,any <type>  s one got a story to tell about a situation that you experienced and either regretted or are proud of that might even changed you for the better or worse i hope this story is n t violating tos of pc because of drug reference the following occurred about   years ago for me i feel proud of a situation and maybe a little regret where i went with some friends         to play disc golf since they asked me we played some then they  d gather in a secluded area and sat around and then they started to light up a bong   shocked i did n t know what to do so i just stayed with them and kindly rejected a puff or what ever you do with it because i did n t want to touch something like that a few even told me something like  class good for you  or  i wish i could be like you  kitteh roud after finishing our game and left i did n t know if i should have called the police or told one of the teachers guidance concealer which i did n t do anything because i did n t know what would have happened to me   our friendship or what not i figured out that day what       was   i usually tell people the same thing about cigarettes alcohol that i do n t smoke or have any and i usually get the same response once in a while that they wish they could be like me or are proud that i do n t 
enfp,okay   guys this is one the other types won t get   except for the <type>s and here we are not wanting to look this one in the face okay today two fellow ne doms were in my office    at different times    and both at some point went on a deep dive for their phone either they or i said the following is it in that pocket    it might be in this coat pocket    what about this pant pocket    did it get left in the car    do you want me to call you    one of them noticed that i was scrutinizing her while she was searching i was seriously wondering if she was going to find it quicker than i do in the morning it felt like a drum roll she looked up at me and said i m sure it s here somewhere i used to not have a purse i guess i was even worse back then    kind of maybe    my purse holds a lot of stuff to look through about a year ago the guy who was at the door making sure everyone hand sanitized for covid he knows i m not stupid at least not in the typical way he watched me rummaging through my purse every stupid morning before clocking in he said one day when i laughed at his expression why do you always have to search through your purse    i knew the answer because i had realized a few years ago    because my infant si had grown a baby tooth or said a first word or had some kind of leap in development   because i m middle aged now    what learned that i had to pay attention when i was putting something away you see putting the badge in my purse every time was a new win i usually was searching not just my purse but everything else too my car my bookshelves my bathroom but at age    my si grew up enough to realize that i knew that if i pay attention when i take the thing off and put it in the same place then it later saves me time so i said i forget to put it into the same place in my purse each time he said well   why    with so much genuine confusion because he knows i m smart we used to work together before he retired and started to do volunteer work it would be incomprehensible to understand that i m actually really proud of myself just for getting the thing into my purse consistently because my brain doesn t work like most people s i forget to place it carefully in the same place when i take it off i m glad to get it just into my purse well   why    i don t know i ve been working on it for my whole life okay   so when i got it into my purse consistently it was because all of a sudden eureka i suddenly understood i needed to pay attention when i took it off    novel concept      right    can i do it again to put it not just into my purse but into a certain part of my purse    after watching the   ne doms with their purses today i realized how crazy this is that i don t pay attention at that moment but can i do it    after all my brain is obviously nowhere near my purse at the moment i m putting that thing away i will try we look ridiculous   but it s endearing to me   of course because you know i m talking about phones and badges here   but every ne dom here knows i m not just talking about phones and badges i m talking about keys and glasses and cards and flipping everything else how many years of my life are spend searching for that thing i put down a minute ago    alright fess up ya all and give yourself a hug while you re at it and our partners a hug too because of course one of these <type>s has a husband whose job is like my husband s to constantly observe me looking frantically for that thing and get concerned about it with me for the many hours of our life together let s all scream and hug   the one thing i m sure of we ne doms have to have self compassion and humor for ourselves with the thingies or nobody else will   that s for sure fess up   please do   
estp,i  d rather not go into too much detail   but i had a falling out with an <type> and was sure he hated me well   we  re back in contact now and he  s acting the same as he did before i was just wondering how you guys would act when hurt   and if maybe this is why he stopped talking to me

esfp, note i had posted this a few months ago on the <type> forum   however i didnt get as much feedback as i would have liked   so i thought i would post it here too   this is directed at any other male <type>  s on this forum   or any female <type>  s that have been in this situation have any of you ever been in relationships with a female <type> male <type>    i   for one have been in relationships with more than one female <type> and neither of them have worked out i  ve always felt like female <type>s have been drawn to me   although i m not quite sure why at first   i always seem to connect magnificantly with the female <type> there warm   bubbly   fun loving personality usually puts me at ease and really helps me be myself   and at first i really find myself enjoying spending time with the <type> and generally connecting wonderfully on an emotional level but ofcourse   as time goes on   it always becomes more and more apparant that things arent going to work out i become to needy   paranoid   controlling and serious especially if the <type> i m in a relationship with likes to flirt a bit with other guys <type>s like to be spontanious and <type>s like to plan   that is usually another problem i have also found that <type>s cannot take the slightest bit of criticism even if its constructive they view it as a personal attack on their character   there emotional outburts are really hard to deal with although being an <type>   i am also guilty of outbursts of anger i m just wondering if there are any other male <type>s out there that have been in relationships   or have found themselves drawn to female <type>s or anyone who can help shed some light on to why things just did n t work out i get on really well with a healthy <type> and i was wondering if there is anything i can do to make a relationship with them work      what  s the secret to making a healthy female <type> happy    thanks x

enfp,today i had a rude awakening   the kind that you only invite when you try to explain to someone who unintentionally hurt you what you learned from them hurting you it made me understand that my world view and optimism are based on the idea that there is meaning in learning ibelieved that the purpose of life is to learn and to become a better person   but what if further perspective means that the lessons i learned so strongly were wrong when given more time and perspective even if they were true for me at the moment   what if they never apply to anything current or future    will i be able to even help others    i always want to write a book to make people feel and learn   and maybe by reading what i went through and learned then they can feel less alone and understand the lesson i learned but hopefully without the heartache of years i was raised with stories that happened to people during world war   and i thought my whole generation learned racism was wrong   that oppressed people have voices to be heard i ve been thinking lately that we forgot these lessons and that now people are focused on what they are learning and the problems alive today i had an optimism that by the time i was older there would be equality it seemed it was going that way then i think that my generation hasn t done enough for climate change   yet we might be the last generation who really remember playing outside before the internet who remember how loud the bees were in every bush and tree   who know how few birds and frogs there are now compared to how it was when i was a kid and i don t think there is really anything truly wild anymore   maybe only up in northern regions   but there was when i was a kid so this lesson will it mean the same to any future group    i was realizing all at once that my optimism is based on the importance of learning and that simultaneously i was learning that my learning wasn t so important and then   to save me   a wave of humor comes into my heart making me laugh at myself   love myself and know that this moment in time is as important as any future understanding and still serves that same purpose of letting me know i m not alone and others will not be alone other things explored today was the cult out there of twinflames a friend who asked me yesterday can i ask you   are you living the life that you want to    and thoughts about unresolved trauma and how i deal with it this might be my new diary 
enfj,hello everyone   i am an <type> for me   friends are either very close   or they are merely an acquaintance my close friends are usually <type>   <type>   and <type> there is something i love about nf  s i have been wondering why i have n t had any close friends who are <type> i have two potential friends at the moment who are <type>s i feel their nf ness   which makes me want to become closer friends but   it is almost as if they do n t have this need is this true    do <type>  s not really need close friends    they seem to have lots of friends   on a medium level they connect to people easily   and they are not superficial   but they do n t seem to go as deep as <type>s they stop at a certain level are they happy with this level    are <type>  s very conscious of what behaviour is appropriate   and what is inappropriate    how important to you is acting appropriately    i think that the ip vs ej difference i feel means that we are different in our impressions of what is appropriate you have fe first i have fi first we both want to please people because we are nf  s but   this desire is different i have no desire to conform i take pleasure in being different   thinking outside of the box   and finding my own rules for everything in life whereas <type>  s are more aware of the box they are more aware of what is appropriate and they seem to expect me to act inside the box something like that    and their ti does your ti allow you to avoid topics    does it allow you to steer conversations into a direction that you feel more comfortable with    i try to be direct   addressing something inappropriately intense and she just steers it to where she feels comfortable something like that i would love to hear what you think of <type>s   and if you can explain the difference between them i would be grateful for any insight you have i would love to be close friends with an <type> because i feel it would help me understand the whole range of nf ness however   maybe they just are n t the close friend type   at least not according to my definition of close friend if they are n t   i am probably better to just give up on this idea   and just let them be the medium level friend they want to be 
entp,hi first time post   i  dont really expect anybody to understand what the heck i was trying to do or understand my actions but hopefully somebody can give me some advice on how i can fix this and english is not my main lang i m a <type> and i did n t figure this out until couple of months ago so i have never heard about personalities or done any research on it this is my story i m gonna try to keep it short it started when i was really young   in the beginning of my     s i started to date   girls at the same time    had sexual relationship with both      and i ended up with one of them into a full time relationship and moved in with her the other girl    she is a <type> which i did figure out recently      i did still keep contact with the other one but only couple of times a month at best my main problem is how to deal and move on with the girl that is a <type> from the very start she knew that i was dating a other girl she knew that i still am in a relationship i did not have sex with her expect from in the beginning which is now almost    years ago so the years past by and i did have contact with her we both love to talk to each other and we understand each other perfectly i did visit her couple of times    maybe     times tops in a year      we went out and had great time i mean   it was fucking awesome we went to a bar and we went there to get something to eat none of us had time to even read the meny so we always ended up with not eating anything that feeling when time just pass by in a split of a second   it always felt like magic it did feel like a date   every single time and at the end she did kiss me    we did n t have sex for    years and she never invited me home in the last years    i know that for a fact that she was in love in me at some point so i told her that we could t be together because it wo n t fit at this point of our life we both had a huge mess in our life   it was like a disaster she did agree in my head   i wanted to keep her whatever the price it would be i love every single second that i m with her but for my part   it could be just like a great friend somebody that would be around with me for the rest of my life   somebody who can take on my bullshit she is the kind of girl that i could go out and pick up boys and girls for both me and her   lol   just for fun obv   recently everytime i was there to visit her   she started to make up things to avoid to meet me i do n t mean those normal things like i  have a headache   ca n t meet you it looked like a game of power sort of thing i asked her first if she was avaiable on friday and she said yes and wanted to meet me so i bought tickets to a stand up show   and i thought we both needed something to laugh of and the thursday comes   she said me this msg i do n t like that you did n t ask me if i could be out that late   i just wanna ditch the hole thing now yeah   she had work next day   but it was never a problem before we always did hangout late   work or whatever did n t matter i do n t have those msgs anymore   but in most of them she is attacking i do n t understand why like if i did n t respect her or something like that so i got really pissed because it did happend couple of times and it fucking exploded   and now she wo n t talk to me at all we had this huge fight   i mean she wo n t give me any answer on what she wanted and expected from me i told her   just be straight with me i did push her so far that either you will do it   or yeah   she blocked me now none of this made any sense in my head   nothing it never happend before   even when she was in a relationship just to make it clear i  can be a fucking asshole   i  can be a douchebag but not vs this one never   i was really straight with her about my feelings   thoughts and action i was really trying to make her days and mine better   and i was trying to improve on every single lvl she also did make me a better person overall she also loved every single time we went out i was always trying to find something new to do like not even for a date   but as exp in life in general things that we hav n t done before summary of our relationship we could never figure out what we had   but whatever the heck we do have it  was great   it was beyong awesome and this happend out of nowhere i m stuck dunno what to do now    is it really that simple    she was just in love with me and she knew that we could n t be together    
enfj,we needed one of these tongue you know you  re an <type> when   sometimes you think you  re too happy for this world   so much that you have to try and tone down your enthusiasm for fear of appearing insane   you feel like you could never run out of love for people and are amazed by how much you could care for each and every one of your friends   you get confused when people doubt your love for them even when you  ve showered them with more attention than anyone else    ahem   <type>s      you laugh too much and sometimes get in trouble for it   people are surprised to find out that you  ve got a little bit of depth to your personality wink   your music taste is all over the place   there are some people in your life that you hug every time you see them   and you do n t know why   when you get emotional    both happy and sad      you speak a tad metaphorically   people quote you    people somehow relate your presence to abstract things such as sunshine   lights and stars    you love sending your friends mail    sometimes you smother your loved ones with so much attention that it embarrasses them   and you just think it  s funny    examples of an appropriate time to do this is at birthday parties       you just go overboard in general that  s all i have for now your turn

isfp,i have read elsewhere that there are correlations between mbti type and measurable intelligence i have also read that there are not correltaions between mbti type and intelligence while i do n t really know what to believe about how mbti type relates to intelligence   i am curious to know what high intelligence looks like in sensing types because i am an intuitive type and i do n t really understand the sensing preference that well i posted this in the <type> forum simply because it made sense to pick a sensing type forum for this question and i therefore had to pick one as far as i am concerned   any sensing types      or anyone who has insight into highly intelligent sensors      are welcome to answer when i think of intelligence      as it is typically defined and measured by tests      i think of pattern detection   ability to learn with fewer examples   ability to extrapolate and make accurate abstractions   etc how does this effect the sensing functions    
istj,hello <type>s   in this interview   i got a chance to talk to jessica about what it  s like to be an <type> si fi sb c    p    fm the first thing i noticed is jessica  s feminine si and despite it being her lead function   she has a bad memory we also discussed her double feminine sf sleep and how she tends to have an identity crisis and does n t feel confident about things she processed she said she also tends to forget the story of the shows she watches and needs to see them again and again jessica said that her nt play last comes out at night and sometimes makes it harder to sleep so   she started doing martial arts to deal with the extra energy at the end of the day jessica is very info dominant and even if she does n t want to gather new information   she will for the sake of accuracy she said there are times she would not text back a friend until she has googled the info well enough that she can provide them with an accurate reply jessica also talked about her big road trip in western united states and how it fed her nf consume and gave her a sense of excitement and gratitude after returning back home watch this interview here

esfp,i read that <type>s dislike reading is that always true    or are there <type>s who like to read    i m asking because somebody thinks my personality type is <type>    but i do n t usually act like it because bad stuff happened and my parents are autistic    but i  ve loved reading ever since i figured out how to read when i was four i also read that they do n t like science fiction   but i really like doctor who none of this was in the description of <type> on    personalities is it true    sorry if this is the wrong section 
istp,as you all know by now   being an <type> has some drawbacks one of those happens to be in dealing with others we do n t play well with others anyway   i  ve noticed we do n t whine very much and if we do   it  s usually at the inability to solve a problem   being overwhelmed   the stress that comes with daily life   etc it does not   however   come from a sense of entitlement like most other people we often hold our heads up high with anticipation with what  s to come with a steely resolve that is absent in most people so what happens in turn    people dump their cry baby bullshit on us for years   i thought i was holding auditions for baby mario   fer god  s sake whaaaa   whaaaaa   whaaaaaaaa   and well you know it  s me i do n t know maybe i m weird or something   but i did the conventional thing and tried to comfort people like the tv told me to do   or be nice to them or whatever you  re supposed to do when somebody is shamelessly fishing for cheap attention you know that scene in inglourious basterds where brad pitt uncomfortably imitates an italian director and ca n t even get past the thick hillbilly accent    there  s your analogy for me and comforting others thoughts on this    
intp,morning all i  ve posted similarly in the past   and though i understand the <type>s in my life a great deal more than most of the people around them   i never assume to understand you guys completely when it comes to extreme displays of emotion what does your utmost fury look like   on the rare occasion it actually rears it head    and given the option to vent your anger in any which way you could possibly imagine   what would you do    i m researching for a piece of writing   and i  d really like to get this right something i m looking portray in my writing is how introverts behave when in their own private space it  d be good for the wider world to get a bit more familiar with this and today  s line of enquiry is <type>  s when they  re pissed off to a biblical degree looking forward to hearing how mental you can get   
infj,i feel my best when i can engage in all my functions   especially fe it can be tempting to be stuck with ni ti over analysis that tend to go nowhere now   when i do some self expression   or something emotional related   it could be writing   improving emotional atmosphere   a loose and enjoyable company   that  s where i felt really happy of course   this is a conclusion based on theory   and all humans need this   but even then   i find this really euphoric for the sake of theory   though   it  s me engaging with fe sure   this ni ti  s aha moment are transcending   but it can be enhanced further when it could be applied   and validated through fe as its output channel however   i  ve been unhealthy most of the time   especially with anxiety and doubts and ni ti   or basically just my introverted state   when stuck for too long   could be really unethical and irritable i want to go out there and have fun without limiting myself let  s say   theoretically   my fe se are starving   but realistically   i need more goddamn enjoyable social interaction where i can be myself without having to limit myself    fear    because   like      of my social interactions in college is just me putting a mask let  s say   my cs major is full of nt  s and i have to put in logical facade and to compete    ni ti focus    anyway   i digress writing is a good start   but when it comes to real life social interactions   street smarts   public speaking   i m just a toddler lmao how to improve fe overall   and to engage with complete immersion    my biggest problem always lies in fear   especially hesitation   due to superego audience judgmental criticism 
istj,hi   <type> here i broke up with a friend because of my own insecurities about people liking me i want to know how any of you <type>s would feel if you were her and if you  d want to forgive fix things so some context   we were really close from the start but later on   something happened that made me question whether she really liked me   and i noticed that she never asked to hang out first just to chill do nothing deep down   i knew she did care about me   but i m really paranoid i ended up trying to convince myself she hated me and that i was the only one who thought we were friends   and the other part of me knew i was being paranoid and tried to convince me otherwise and i was scared of telling her because i thought she  d be annoyed if i kept asking for reassurance or if i seemed like i had mental issues this led me to end up constantly thinking oh if i say do one wrong thing   she  s going to hate me and at the end of the year   she said something that made me realize that i  d been a bad friend and i just apologized too much over text   which was me cutting myself off because i thought i did n t deserve to be her friend i might  ve overwhelmed her since she did n t reply even though it  d been   weeks then i decided to delete our messaging app for   months    i notified her about it and the duration i  d be gone before doing so    during the break   i realized alot of things   like how maybe she did n t actually hate me   and that people do actually like me for my real self and not because i m useful and i asked if she wanted to talk and work things out but my friend told me that me shutting her out was like i did n t trust her and she was n t interested in talking about what went wrong or mending our relationship atm i  ve talked to her once after she texted this   and she seemed uninterested she asked short   cordial questions but mostly just said ok to everything i said i m not doing anything to make her to forgive me   because i know i hurt her and broke her trust but i really did trust her sometimes there are people in your life who you realize ca n t be replaced   because you wo n t be able to meet anyone else exactly like that person for me   she was one of those people   so i want to fix things by talking explaining but is it the same for her    is it a good idea    it seems like she  s not interested in repairing the relationship i really think we could  ve stayed friends if we talked about what was going on thinking about it now   there were alot of things i should  ve told her but did n t because i was scared she  d hate me for being so attached like how much she always mattered to me   and the time when we had just met and i was too shy to ask to hang out   so i ended up going to events i thought she  d go to and waiting   hoping she  d show up   etc the fact that i was afraid to say how much i cared about her seems so stupid now lol alot of people have been telling me that i should n t try to chase someone who obviously does n t like me as much as i do to her i m also not sure if it  s just me used to being mistreated that i feel like it was n t that bad   because the thing that matters to me is that she did care about me at some point idk what are your opinions    i think i  ve changed after our friend breakup because i  ve only recently realized that real friends do n t hate you unless you do something to hurt them and i realize that people like you more if you  re just yourself   and you do n t need to do stuff for people to like you and it  s been easier for me to be myself and stop overthinking and filtering my words whenever i speak i  ve also been talking to strangers alot and getting meals with random people on campus i try not to cut off people as possible friends before getting to know them more first   and my social network is larger now i m more brighter and sociable than i was before   and i m surprised by how easy it was to change so much but i regret that it cost me a friend i really cared about during the   months of no contact   i just kept thinking that i was such a horrible friend and if i could only hurt the people i cared about   i was better off gone the experience really did cripple me   but i guess you can only change this much if you get hurt badly enough to want to 
enfj,greeting <type>s   i  ve read several threads about how awesome <type>s are and how well you get along with <type>s however   i can not say that this matches my experience with my <type> he  s clearly become a very unhealthy <type> i m now sure how to help him become healthy   if anything he  s somewhat manipulative   overly critical    likes to discourage instead of encourage      and he  s pretty defensive whenever he is confronted about these things as you can assume   these actions have effected me as he used to be an amazing person i do n t know what happened to cause him to start acting this way   but if anyone has any insight as to why this could occur or what i can do to help him   it would be grateful appreciated i read somewhere that <type>s love verbal affirmation   so i  ve been trying to give him a lot lately however   whenever i do   he does n t accept my compliments by saying something like no   i m not i m thinking that he could possibly have low self esteem    it  s also worth nothing that he does seem to have low possible underdeveloped intuition he  s certainly an <type> as he  s tested that way and he certainly has xnfx feelings    as i m <type>   i  d know    he  s a very strong judger and feeler though like i said previously   because of his hurtful behavior   this friend of mine is starting to become toxic and hard to be around so if any of you have any ideas of what i can possibly do to help him   i  d greatly appreciate it 
enfj,without getting into too many details   i had an <type> female ex who i actually met while she was in another relationship a few years ago this is a shitty thing to admit   but we had a short emotional affair but i recall her inviting things to get physical on one occasion while her partner was away i awkwardly avoided it she ended things i think when things started to get too intimate    not proud of this    fast forward a year and a half later   her partner who she was with    after she sort of branched to after her previous marriage of    years    and whom she proposed to    he said yes    left her months later she said both were narcissists soon after their breakup   i randomly contacted her out of the blue and she told me they had broken up we connected for a few months before we ended up in a long distance relationship she ended it   months later after significantly pulling away and i proceeded to chase after her right out of my life then contacted me another     months later because she missed me i proceeded to pursue her again   and we ended up the same place with her progressively shutting me down   bailing on plans if i didn t act perfectly i have bipolar disorder and it got triggered by the stress from my fears of abandonment i said some really awful things to her and was sending her pages and pages of texts i feel like she hasn t really taken much accountability she is civil with me now but told me that once it s done with her it s done and i ve heard many <type> s say that i am asking for help with this does that always mean they are done    if not   what would need to happen to repair things    could her offer of staying friends grow into more once i regain her trust    or am i better off going no contact    i do really value her   but our relationship is nothing like it used to be she says too much has happened thank you   <type> learning how to be healthier
istp,my <type> ex husband and i    <type>    live in different countries when we got divorced he said that we would keep in touch and i asked if i could visit him we haven t been in touch as much as i would like when i asked if he was still of the same opinion about me visiting he replied saying that those things might be more complicated than just say yes or no so i m guessing he is unsure of what he wants what would be your advice on how we could figure out what is best for us    
isfp,basically   there s this <type> dude in my class that sits next to me we don t know each other and we had just enrolled into the same lecture by chance one day   while we were writing down notes   i caught the dude sneaking looks on my paper to copy off   but i let it slide because i didn t really want to give him the cold shoulder after a few rounds of that   now i was the one who lost concentration and couldn t write down some stuff   so i opened my book to see what i missed out on   but he tapped my arm and showed me his writing i was really grateful of that and i appreciated it a lot   so i wanted to be closer with him but no matter what i say   it always ends there   i tried to make conversation by asking him his mbti type   and it ended there lol   and another time i caught him spinning his pen   so i couldn t help it and blurted that it was really cool how he did that i don t think he even replied i remember he didn t even meet my eyes though he looked straight ahead like i wasn t there so i decided to ask if he had a social   and he responded if i wanted to know it   and then i said yes and told him to write it down that s pretty much the only conversation we had that lasted longer than ten seconds i don t know why he won t look at me in the eye maybe he s just shy around everyone he did occasionally lean towards me to look at my writing to check if he wrote things right that s pretty much it i know i m being really   really   petty   and i m sorry in advance   but is he not willing to talk to me    i felt a little uneasy because i wondered if i was making him uncomfortable 
enfj,i have    better said had    an <type> t girlfriend   which now hates or does n t like me because i told her that i have gender dysphoria and do you know how to i can make her to continue the relationship    if it  s possible    or at least how to make her to forgive me    if that  s also possible       i think it hurt her it is my first relationship and since this information would n t hurt me much    actually   not at all    if she told me that   so i thought it would n t hurt her too much    this is the first time i m writing a post here so could you please also tell me how i should make them better       
estp,this is to see what an <type> would say random questions dig deep question  so if i say i am going to go pimp slapping   what the heck does that mean          
enfp,i m reading a neuroscience book about the power of meditation and or prayer and what it can do for your brain even when you aren t religious some of the take home tips about meditation suggested are that focusing the mind on your spiritual goals each day can have the effects of increased memory   less anxiety   slower to anger or irritate   better social awareness   noticeably quicker ability to solve tasks   to name a few they tossed the idea of spiritual goals out there without describing what spiritual goals are i have been very religious most of my life and used to have quite transformative experiences with prayer   so this morning i wanted to pray like i used to no   i haven t been praying   a few years ago i decided it was useless as i no longer am a believer and have not been able to get my belief back   despite prayer i figure the things i mentioned in my prayer this morning might be considered spiritual goals here is my prayer from this morning help me to feel healthy enough to help my patients today help my secretary and i to get along    she s been mad that i ve been off sick of course it makes a lot of extra stress and work for her    help me to figure out how to make my kids feel loved this christmas and figure out what to do for them    presents   christmas atmosphere   etc    i guess those are spiritual goals    for me my connections with others what i give out to others    i can t imagine what else would be but just like this book says every single person has a very unique take on god    it doesn t matter if they are in the same religion one will focus on him as an vengeful cosmic force   the next like a loving human parent   another a spirit from within    use very different language to describe spiritual experiences and how incredibly surprising this was to the researchers i bet each person would have a very unique take on their spiritual goals would you be willing to share yours with me us    i would love to get an idea of what this means for others thank you and well wishes   
enfp,i was wondering about our personality type and how many of us have adhd    personally have reached a point where i m questioning self worth and where it  s tied as a person   with our experiences   upbringing and where adhd plays a role with how to handle situations also   how much does the respect you receive from your parents effect how your partner respects you    i want to get the <type> perspective of self worth   those with or without adhd for the comparison and also views about how family dynamics influence relationships    great to include family dynamic mbti types if they are known    
istp,if you are an <type> then tell me what it means when it says you have a strong need for space in a relationship give examples are you ever called neglectful    <type> profile
intj,met an <type> and the conversation went ongoing frequently they asked me a lot of questions    mostly about my interests   what i do   etc etc    and i tried my best to respond to all of them however   they often suddenly changed the topic after i responded to their question and asked about something else about me when i made a comment of something like for example   right it s so easy to do that   or just a remark about what they said like i agree it s so hard to do that they practically bombarded me with questions that it felt like an interview after that kept going i answered another question of theirs and the conversation suddenly stopped there with them leaving me on read   so i freaked out wondering if i said something bad and quickly told them it was fun talking to them and they read that as well i know i might be overthinking   but i just got curious can you guys tell me general signs    thanks
esfp,hello <type>s   in this interview   i got a chance to talk to andreas about what it  s like to be an <type> se fi cs p    b    ff we started the interview talking about his ni and how hard planning is for him then   we discussed the issue with being blast last and being consume and sleep saviour and how often times   he just ca n t be bothered to do something committing to plans becomes a challenge this specific type because of the indecisiveness of being cs and blast last the only time andreas said he can commit quickly if it  s something he really wants to consume badly like a good movie or food or shopping however   when it comes to hanging out with people   it gets put in the maybe but not sure category until closer to the date andreas said he  s always waiting to see if something better comes up we also talked about productivity and i asked him if he often times feels like he could be more productive andreas revealed that he thinks about it a lot but still ca n t get himself to get started on doing the productive thing he said he  s been trying to get things done before the deadline recently and he  s starting small like with his car repairs watch this interview here 
intj,stereotypically tj types are success oriented and hard working do you think <type>s are more prone to laziness than say   <type>s and <type>s   who are usually very career oriented and always have something planned    it seems like a lot of gamer types are <type>s and i do n t see them as being the hard working people   lol 
estp,just curious   what class would an <type>s suited with    some says <type>s are more of a warrior type 
estp,you  d be like what    <type>s and self sacrifice    <type>s are the least sacrificing kind of the mbti chart well   yeah   technically but there is a surprising amount of examples in popular fiction of <type>s who sacrifice themselves for something even in little things   but there comes a time when something just comes out of the <type>s a hidden shadow maybe    if you think about it   it makes sense <type>  s shadow are <type> and just as <type>  s shadow comes out every once in a while   the <type> in <type> might do the same anyway   here are the examples han solo from star wars    technically   his death star save is n t a sacrifice   but still counts as heroism as he did n t have to do it   so it  s also some kind of awakening of the <type> shadow    steve stifler from american pie    the context being   he has to involve in gay sex to watch the girls  show go further and if you know anything about stifler   you know   it  s the farthest thing from his mind yet   he  s taking one for the team    mike from until dawn    this gets me every time    there  s a better version of this though i could n t find    disturbing    seth saves evan from superbad and finally   thor sacrificing himself for the weapon that can kill thanos i wanted to include other examples but that  s all i could find anyway what do you think    my idea is that anyone with strong se and fe would be willing to be self sacrificing from time to time    i might add   <type>s do the same but in a less theatrical fashion think jack bauer   james bond   every jb cooper from interstellar who literally jumps down a black hole   or solid snake etc    
esfj,how the <type> uses valued fe   si   ne   ti   and unvalued     shadow     se   fi   te   and ni also includes my jungian subfunctions system 
esfj,thank you for being here   <type>s we do n t thank you enough   but we should you  re so bland   annoying   superficial   noisy   prone to please people instead of making selfish   cold   harsh   logical decisions or statements   you make the rest of us feel good about ourselves   god bless fe dom and inferior ti please never leave this world 
estj,where the hell is bloody amazing at socialising and also not so fragile   will shatter if someone says boo 
esfj,just wondering how hal and grandmaster yoda are doing 
esfp,hello <type>s   in this interview   i talked to tiana and jany about their similarities and differences as standard and jumper <type>s this was honestly one if not my most favourite <type> interview yet we started the interview by talking about their most significant difference where tiana    standard <type>    is self above tribe while jany    jumper <type>    is tribe above self jany had the quote of the day when she released an explosive double masculine sleep last rant between the   minute to      minute mark of the interview another great takeaway from the interview is tiana being double introverted feels like she  s letting other people down with the demon te while jany feels like she  s letting herself down with demon fi it was also interesting that what made them happy was completely opposite for jany who is a double extrovert   happiness to her is alone time being introspective or doing what she loves for tiana   it  s using her blast and being productive since she is blast last i also learned that one of the most important things when talking to <type>s is getting to their core because outside their se lead is that deep nf sleep watch this interview here 
enfj,could you please   if you are so kind   walk me through how you chose your given career    you don t have to say want it is but what was the process behind it    
estj,why all the hate for <type>s    i do n t know all the lingo so forgive my uneducated thoughts years ago i found the online test and was amazed at how accurate it was for me i had    okay truth is i originally wrote made and automatically was like damn this is n t helping the case but they had fun whatever    my family and friends take it   was a fun time over the years i  ve retaken the test to see if i  ve changed and other than a closing gap from extroverted to introverted everything  s pretty much stayed the same i have an <type> mother and sister an <type> father and <type> partner for    years our family has its troubles like most but i m the glue that keeps our family together    my immediate family   my partner is another post haha    i talk to my mom like multiple times a day and while i find things about her extremely frustrating we are very close we both just care enough about each other to work through it personality types aside i consider myself to be an empath like   i m not emotional about my own feelings often but someone else  s grief will overwhelm me could be a complete stranger   in a moment i can put myself in their shoes and become a blubbering mess trying to process their sadness grief i have close friends who i like to think greatly enjoy my company and i  ve never had issues making friends in new places   often these people will seek me out or make some statement that i m such a trustworthy   honest   fun person to be around coworkers know i  ll lighten the mood and generally make work a fun place    not just by doing more than my fair share    i can absolutely be domineering and its something i struggle with   because i find it hard to let go of control    i m just so good at quickly coming up with the best   most logical plan to execute things with no detail forgotten    but i am adamant about admitting my wrongs if i m wrong i will genuinely   directly admit it now i hate getting chastised when i am wrong   but understand those that are inferior need to shoot their shot on the rare occasion they can i get that scratching the surface of us being bossy   especially as a woman   but i am a caring   kind person who genuinely tries to help people   i live for those in my circle and would do anything for them my kid is my world and i want a laid back parental relationship with him where he can tell me anything i try desperately to be a crunchy mom   i try to suppress initial reactions to things fostered by society so he can just be him    thinking along the lines of letting a boy wear a dress or play with dolls    i  d love to think i m just not an <type>   with all the negative opinions i  ve read from other types   it would be an easy way out   but i know its not true so if you  ve made it this far   what  s the deal    
esfp,<type>  s international    what country do you think they live in    ball 
intj,<type> here met this <type> online and we clicked real fast the chemistry was instantaneous then we started talking on the phone he used to call me every single day and keep me on the phone for hours he used to text me every single day as well i am suppose to meet him in real life later this summer in the beginning he was very direct and clear and said that he wants to actively meet and date me   and i concurred two months into knowing each other   he sent me a heartfelt message saying he  s never had a such a quick depthy connection with someone before in his life and how much he loves our connection   and he told me it  s hard for him to say this to someone however   all of a sudden he became really distant and stopped talking to me so i directly sent him a message and asked him what  s up    are you no longer interested or something    how come i never hear from you anymore    i even asked him on two separate occasions if he  s seeing someone right now and he does n t feel right talking to me   he needs to tell me because i do n t like talking to guys who are already seeing someone else   and he said it  s not the case he said that he  s been working a lot   his living situation is hell   his back is hurting him   etc what is strange is that i see him logged on facebook a lot he shows as active on my messenger app he sure is sooo busy   i m getting honestly worried and anxious   and i m not sure if i should take his word for it why he does n t talk to me anymore we grew very close to each other   it does n t make sense for him to stop talking to me all of a sudden did i get boring to him    why is he so quiet all of a sudden    what could be the reason    he could n t get enough of me for two months straight 
entj,do <type>s like hugs    simply answer the above context    reason    history    
istj,well   there  s a song  about  you people now questionable accuracy 
istj,as per the title i think we  ve been getting too many variations of what do <type>  s xxx when xxx and suchlike in the way of posts with some luck people can be directed to one really   really long thread read through it and ask their question if it has n t already been asked and answered who knows   if this takes off it can maybe be stickied edit please try to keep it solidly on topic   eh    long winded derails and suchlike will destroy any value take all potential derails to the random thread   thanks   
istj,i made this for the personality cafe video challenge thread if you  d like to post a video of yourself for us to see   this is the thread 
infj,it seems <type>s    on paper at least    are not necessarily well suited for military life i was curious if there are some <type>s who could share their military experiences and whether or not it was a good fit for them i m currently a cadet at usma   and will commission in a few years as an army officer so far   i  ve thrived in what many view as a harsh environment and i m eager to dive headfirst and continue my military career was wondering if there are other <type>s with similar experiences thanks   
estj,hi im an <type> and had a crush in an <type> girl but i think like always she also put me in the friendzone     i going to go out whith him next week but i cant stop thinkink about that he maybe just go out whit me as friend i met him on instagram and chat whit him now i think i am in the friendzone for talking whit her can anyone give an advice plz    
intj,i  ll tell you why because it makes groups of people feel good to come together in recognition of a mutual enemy regardless of whether that enemy is right or not   people will be their best selves   in the presence of someone who does n t automatically support their miserable   day to day   worldviews and the morality of simple co existence 
entp,hey all first thread   so while i would n t bother being gentle   a little lube would be appreciated i m currently studying physics at university level and as usual my <type>ness is simultaneously saving my ass and fucking me up i just lack the mental discipline required to actually become mathematically competent   but as an <type> i can still rapidly cram and do just over average with basically no work this puts me in the awkward position of seeming to be all talk which i am at the moment interspersed with explosions of violent intelligence that leaves more methodical coursemates jealous and a little passive aggressive as physics students intelligence is a very strong factor in everyone  s ego obviously i need to hide my intelligence a little bit   at least in respect of physics   to stop others feeling threatened i digress what i  d like to know is how many of you other <type>s are strong mathematicians and how did you learn    at the moment i m just doing exam papers but it  s slow going as i have n t really ever done anything more than the bare minimum and i m not keen on using textbooks to help me i do n t want outside influences effecting my natural creativity it  s a weird toss up between launching straight into the physics stuff so my intuition can actually get something to hold on to or to stick with the maths so i can develop my ti more fully to be frank   my understanding of the whole mbti system is shaky at best anyways   any feedback on this would be appreciated on an unrelated note   really enjoying these forums it  s nice to be reminded that i m not the only one who thinks the way i do being an <type> can be seriously fucking lonely sometimes peace
estj,hello <type>s   in this interview   i got a chance to talk to all the exxj types about their shared experiences and what makes them different from one another during the interview   we talked about exxjs having trouble making a decision for themselves and needing permission from the tribe before making decisions we also talked about te shaming ti and fe shaming fi savannah asked an awesome question to the <type> and <type>s on how te  s can be more sensitive to ti  s and not offend them we also discussed what their ti or fi swing looks like when they go on a selfishness swing we also discussed racist jokes and how they perceived it as an exxj we also talked about blood and family ties and how the <type> and <type> perceived it differently from the <type> and <type> double observing was something we tried discussing but the topic was too boring for the exxjs to continue talking about because it  s so easy for them in the end   the exxjs had a message to say to fellow exxjs on how to better themselves as individuals some things i noticed about each participant include julia    <type> and our only info dominant exxj    did an amazing job maintaining the flow of the conversation being balanced with her si fe and ne ti maggie    our jumper <type>    was relatively quiet and focused on gathering the tribe  s perspective rob    our jumper <type> with double activated ti and token male exxj    was acting very exxp like with committing to decisions savannah    our jumper <type>    asked some very good questions to the lead fe  s nina    our jumper <type> and only lead nt    was doing a makeshift double decider which shows how present that masculine fi is at the bottom when double activated natalie    our <type> and only mf    produced many hilarious moments including before the interview with her blast to nina just seconds after learning something from julia and finally   heather shows the big difference between an <type> and <type> when it comes to dealing with presenting themselves to the tribe i also thought it was interesting that julia being info dominant was not as scared of how the tribe perceived her as the energy dominants were julia said she can clarify with the tribe which shows the easy flow of information while natalie said she never thought of asking the tribe and just assumed everyone hated her watch this interview here 
istp,how <type> would deal with being themselves and its consequences in front of their dates and s o    like not being worried about what their parents would think and feeling relaxed in doing acts not normally seen as polite   like cursing    not to them      expressing their inner anti social thoughts   being messy   etc in brief during a romantic relationship would you watch your behavior often if not consistently or be relaxed and act as you would when by yourself    and how would you deal with the consequences of being yourself    
estp,im stealing this topic to moxie    from <type> sub forum    link provided is jung preference exploration personality test its having     questions   but i was ready in   min   its not as that hot test offers your actualized type    who you are      prefered type    who you want to be    and attraction type    who are you attracted to    in case you are lazy to do test   questions are      if you werent <type>   which other type would you like to be         who are you attracted to    in case you arent lazy to do test      do you think that result correspond    
infj,can you be so detached    how    can i    why    if we would be only going from place to place   if we were to never stop   and to never admit that by itself   we should requalify whatever we call the me as absolutely inoperant to tell whatever really is going on the me is telling everything that he   by itself   does n t at all think of a storm   that  s the real me that goes from place to place   could he be that storm   if he was not to be detached   lost in the first place   if he was not to conjure himself by whatever storms in his way   that he does n t romanticize himself to be of his origin   that he would n t be able himself to direct himself into the way of that storm    that me does n t exists that  s where technology comes with romanticization   absolute attachment to the origin of the me   he   he storms into all those places which he would n t have gone to before its origin is it bad      would you ask    we storm away   we see progress not that in the material way   be it remained untouched   we do n t ourselves towards it if   by compareason   i would be attached to it   sentimentally and commonly speaking   i know for sure it would n t exist in this way and   if   if   technology comes in the forefront of it   i sure would n t be able to see it at all anywhere on earth dot 
estp,i just joined personality cafe and have been posting pretty heavily in the <type> forum turns out i  ve been    accidentally   i swear      kicking everyone in the balls over there   kind of feeling like i do n t belong anywhere   then   woe is me the isolation of integration have any of you experienced this    have you gotten too sensitive and poetic for your <type> brethren    laughing do any <type>s ever wander over here    
entj,is it <type>   because they share te as a dominant function    <type>   because they use te and ni   but with different emphasis    <type>   because they share the t n s f function order   but with all functions in opposite orientation    <type>   because you believe j p is the least important dichotomy    <type>   because you see te and fe as similar enough that the enj pattern is most important    <type>   because they have dominant thinking paired with ni se    <type>   because they have a te se external face loop    
entp,hello   i have never met an <type> personally but from the things i read it seems possible what are your opinions    
enfp,i wonder if i will just keep this thread up and fish for it every time i meet a new <type> feel free to add your own description when you guys meet one too i see from     patients a day now    used to be more but the appointments are now longer i m not a doctor i m a diabetes educator dietitian   btw    anyway   i just met another <type> and i think i will keep writing and describing us this particular gal was so quick so quick that the actual things i needed to teach her    which are complex concepts    took about    th of the time i went to re hash everything like i usually do   because usually it takes a few repetitions and i could tell she had it but the conversation all the things she was talking about took loads of time this particular girl s ne combined with what i think would often be called adhd she cannot get enough info she is constantly learning new things   doing art   cooking and taking care of her family it seems like she could have even handled a great deal more if anyone was able to give that many concepts that fast   then i think she would be the quickest person to get a ph d if anyone taught that way and tried to put something they have ever learned in fast track i gotta say nobody has ever come close to learning as fast in my office but at the same time talked so much but it s not like it wasn t relevant i think it s just more than what most people usually do in a given space of time she said she s just barely gotten onto an adhd drug    she was never really diagnosed    and says instead of looking for her keys three times in an hour each morning it s now down to once progress she knows nothing about mbti   but it was really fun to see she was very sweet and also has been through the wringer with her health she has a rare diseases and has had a major organ transplant   so there was a lot to do   but the education   like i said   was a breeze the amount of into she brought to tie into what we were discussing was impressive it made the conversation different to manage than the average human being or even than the average <type> it was fun   and i m cheering for her   she does so much   much more than the average person in a day one other thing she was able to ask questions that were conceptual based on the ones that i explained i m glad when people can just put it to use well done   <type> oh and i forgot also   in a class i was teaching today    a new group each time      there was an <type> man and he knew how to ask such good conceptual questions that i couldn t help it   i basically told the core and over view of what was happening in the body right upfront when he asked   and it s more complex than i usually go for this class   but to my mind even though everybody else had gone silent it helped explain everything that we were then going to talk about and a lot of people enjoyed that class today so i think after i repeated a few of those concepts with examples later   it made a big impact after the class   he actually gave me info on something i ve been looking for in the community for years so he got to the heart of everything fast loved it   he got excited to hear it all and so i did too 
isfp,i do n t know how to express this clearly   but i  ve heard <type>s often describe themselves as feeling different from other people unique   spacey   weird   daydreamy   and others so my questions are   what specific kinds of situations prompt that feeling    why    how often do you feel that way    did you ever mistype yourself as an n because of feeling unique    thanks for your insight i m still trying to understand you guys 
infp,hi everyone   i started this thread to see if anyone knows what their ayurvedic dosha types is i m a vata and i know the mbti and dosha type tell me some similar and also different things about myself   but both pretty much have me nailed i  d like to elaborate on my findings and get some feedback but first i m hoping to get this thread going do n t know much about enanogram types but i  ll look into it in the very near future if you have the slightest inclination to respond to this post then please do so thanks 
istp,i  ll leave it with you to figure out which one is which   lol 
intp,i was wondering what would be negative ti si loop be like    
estj,hi   i m brand new to this forum and just recently settled on <type> while most everything fits   i have been reading that <type>  s do n t get emotions and in general   we do n t get others being sensitive and that we welcome conflict although i am very aware of functioning out of my te and fi   i am very sensitive   feel emotions deeply and experience epathy for others as well i am drawn to people and animals that are suffering or lost somehow and naturally come along side them i  ve also read that we can leave relationships easily but one of my greatest fears is abandonment also am devasted by conflict in close relationships all this but i m mostly in my head should i be checking out other type possibilities or is this something others here relate to    
enfp,can an <type> be always needy in interactions    this is just a thought and not an absolute truth about all <type>s but i wanted to know from your experiences and break this thought by sharing your perspectives 
isfj,congregate here <type> men tell me about yourselves 
isfp,hello everyone i created this account to ask you guys for input about a situation i m having with a girl i m sure is <type>    obvious fi and se   quite reserved    since i m fi inf and have trouble figuring you guys out i  ll try to make it as brief as possible so   for a while i noticed this girl was always near me   would often stare and give subtle signs   even sitting next to me when there were empty seats and i saw her smiling at me i never talked to her nor gave her any sign back   it was just an awkward place to do it and it would go wrong for sure   but now she acts like she completely despises me she was just behind me in queue these days and suddenly just queue jumped me another day   i had no choice but to move closer in and she started to face away from me   i was n t even showing any signs that i  d talk to her she  s always around my view showing her back as to sign she  s not interested   but still i still catch her watching me sometimes i m sure it  s a unpleasant situation for both parties to be in   and all i  ve done was minding my business   and now more than ever it  s all i can do   anything else would just make things worse it  s clear to me she  s sending a message    a very negative one lol    but i m too dense to understand why   she could just ignore my presence and go on with it as i show it  s clear i m not going to bother her 
isfp,hello <type>s   i m here to ask a question on the cognitive functions stacking of your type because i m going through a typing crisis i  ve typed myself as <type> for a long time   but i  ve started to have doubts mainly because of two functions se and te as for se   the problem is that my se seems to be nonexistent i do n t live in the present but rather in my own head   i m not really spontaneous and ca n t live in the moment   and when i try to do that    which is usually when i m drunk   as i find it hard to let myself go otherwise    it ends up being a mess and chaotic more than anything else the problem with te is that it seems to work better than my se i m not the type of person to plan every little thing   but at the same time i m no airhead who ca n t get things done i can indeed be organized and efficient when i need to be    i was described as a war machine on my job   which is in the research field for context      because as long as i can do things my own way   i have no problem with deadlines and time management and all that stuff i like to have a general plan for my day just to have a general idea of where i m going while still keeping it flexible nor am i extremely emotional to the point of not being able to hold back judgement when i need to   i know when it is the moment to express myself and when i need to shut up i also do n t really see myself in inferior te problems and a fi ni loop makes no sense because i  ve been like this my whole life and not just for some period of time the only thing i m sure about is that ni and fi and my highest functions and everything else around that makes no sense do any of you <type>s relate to this   and or have an explanation    i do n t know if it can help or influence anything   but in enneagram i m a  w         or        so sx 
infj,i figured somebody might possibly like a thread where they will be able to post the random things on their mind   whether it  s an idea   a simple thought   complex thoughts   problems anything they wish to share without criticism or judgement let  s face it   writing down our thoughts   feelings   wisdom   etc   is n t the best thing to do because   although often personal   it disallows the communication with other humans we so desire    plus this saves the trees that we should be using to cut down on carbon dioxide   yet we instead cut them down    i  ll go first why the hell is coming up with a random thought so difficult when you feel as though you  re in the spotlight   yet you do it all the time when you do n t feel pressured    also   hard nipples 
infp,hi guys   i registered here today   but i  ve been looking for information here often i just want to talk about problems of <type>  w  from my point of view i hid my emotions for many years   especially anger i met my girlfriend about a year ago she taught me not to hide my emotions   and that was good but now i have become very aggressive   it  s a big problem i ca n t control my emotions i am calm and peaceful often   but i get upset very easily and get angry because of it i constantly insult everyone around me when i feel bad i tell myself every day that i am terrible i do n t want to hurt my loved ones how do you deal with your anger    i just want an advice 
infp,i  ve found a good channel on youtube that has some accurate insight to <type> types primarily because the videos are put out by an <type> if you  re <type>   see if you do n t find some value in these 
intj,am late for work but will edit later to insert all the tact general shot across bows for people unfamiliar with the recurring derails on the original gooey feels thread this is not a conversational milieu you  re welcome to read   but it  s important to understand that people posting here are not inviting a conversation about what they post and they wo n t welcome it expanding here to say this should be assumed to include such one on one channels as private messages and comments on the poster  s visitor wall so if you feel an urge to advise a poster   tell a poster your own feelings based on their feels   think you know the answers or just generally have an opinion that was n t asked for   please take it outside of this thread and even then   be aware that unless the poster has actually said they would n t mind being approached   the chances are still pretty good that you  ll be crossing a line no matter how good your intentions are   no matter how much you feel like you  ll die if you do n t get to chip in informal studies have shown that <type>s    and for all i know other types too    genuinely appreciate having a place where they can express themselves without entering into some implicit  social contract  that obligates them to put up with other people  s two cents about whatever they have just said those who get it wo n t need that justified and those who do n t can no longer say they were n t warned thank you i made minor edits to this   by the way 
entp,ok so i met this guy that i believe to be an <type> on tinder by the second time we went out for dinner   i felt insane chemistry and connections with him then few days after   we ran into each other again at a bar    actually he knew i was gonna be there and told me he and his friends might hit up the same place so when he did come later that night   i went downstairs    lower floor of the bar    to say hi   and we ended up dancing and leaving the bar together and hooked up    booze involved of course    that night while we stayed together i kind of let on that i hadn t done it    the deed    for a long time   and i wasn t sure if he got the hint that this sort of impromptu hookup isn t actually something i typically do but anyways we had a pretty great night the next day when we were about to part ways i only quickly hugged him while saying goodbye   then just went downstairs to the subway station    cuz he seemed to be in a rush to go meet his cousin for brunch as they had planned it beforehand    but later that night he texted to check in we briefly exchanged a few texts the next day we texted again and i asked him if he d like to meet in the next few days as i will be out of the town over the weekend he told me sure but since his cousin is still visiting    from another country      he wasn t sure when he would be available upon hearing that i told him it s ok i ll just let you hang out with your cousin then   no worries   or we could play it by ear he said ok he will let me know if he s not doing anything with him however i just never heard from him again for the rest of the week the following week i texted him again asking how he was and if he s still hanging out with the cousin he replied and told me yes and now his boss is also in town attending a surgery conference we briefly exchanged a few more texts again and i just left it there because i didn t want to bother him also at the time i didn t have a good feeling about where this was going and thought he probably wanted to end things already and withdrew however   few days later   he texted me again telling me that he d been busy taking his boss around touring    his boss flew from the u s    and just got back from the gorge    a famous scenic spot in my country which is fairly far away from the city    then he told me that he has to fly back to the u s for a job interview for a few days   but maybe we can hang out next week after he s back i told him ok let me know then we did not contact each other for the following week as again i did not want to bother him   since i assumed he would be busy preparing for having the interview   plus visiting family friends and stuff a week later he did text me again   but told me that he kind of met someone on the plane that he has a pretty good connections with   so he would like to see where that goes and he typically doesn t like to get involved with multiple people at the same time   so if we meet it has to be totally as regular friends i was too upset upon hearing that so i did not respond at all few days after i calmed down   i figured maybe i should still respond out of politeness since he at least wasn t trying to string me along so i texted back   and that was already two weeks later   first thanking him for being upfront with me i told him it wasn t something i was happy to hear   but i do appreciate his honesty   and that we could totally stay friends and maybe hang out later when we have time also i wish things are going well for him he replied by first thanking me too and saying that ok maybe he can tell me his untold story if we hang out haha    the story he said he will tell me later when we had dinner before    i said ok   and that was it it s been two months   honestly i was so hurt because i really like this guy and i have a hard time believing he would have a stronger connection with someone that he just randomly met on the plane that he s willing to just drop me like that and choose to proceed with her i have been trying to keep myself busy and move on because i thought his behavior after we spent the night together and the things he said had all made it clear he has no interest in taking things further or even getting to know me better sometimes i thought i ve felt better after this amount of time passed   but somehow recently i ve been itching to reach out to him   because as i said above i just have a hard time believing he did not feel the same level of connections chemistry we had as i did and i really was just caught up by my own fantasy wishful thinking i ve been suppressing the urge to text him but i feel i couldn t withhold it any longer could some fellow <type> guys shed some light on this    and what s your take on me reaching out to him at this point       we have not contacted each other at all over the past two months    one thing i did think about is that although i believe my behaviors should be quite telling that i am into him   i never confessed my feeling to him nor did we talk about any relationship stuff during the time we spent together    we did have some raw revelation about ourselves that s why i thought we had a connection      because to me it was also too early to talk about that kind of stuff since we d only met for three times   but i actually wanted to get to know him and was interested in exploring a relationship with him    we are both in our thirties so of course i am looking for a possible long term mate    i just never had a chance to convey those thoughts to him because things happened too quickly and he probably has no idea i ve been experiencing so much emotional turmoil during this time because you know   as an infx type   we are usually not too gushy at the beginning and we like to give people space and not to be bothersome    that s also why after we spent the night together i didn t initiate text contact much either because i wasn t sure what he wanted    do you think i still have a chance with him    what s the best course of action i should take right now    just continue to try to move on    and could anybody help explain his behavior to me    if he just saw it as a casual fling   why did he still bother to stay or even initiate contact with me afterwards    was it because he knew he wasn t ready to take things further but actually likes and respects me as a person enough so he would rather be upfront with me than hurting me even more down the road   hence the initiation of contact but suggestion of hanging out as friends    or is it purely just a form of polite rejection    also   do you think it  s possible that he felt the pressure of commitment after sex so he spooked and wanted to jump right back into the dating game upon first opportunity presented    the lady on the plane       thanks in advance and sorry for the long post frustrating i am a newbie here although i ve been lurking for a while roud another thing to add is i could sometimes come off as an outgoing   live in the present   go with the flow kind of extrovert if you have n t known me well enough   as i am a people person and know how to have fun when the time is right so could there be a slight possibility that he thought i was also just looking for some fun    
enfp,okay   this is actually a scientific like question   i might need to change the title i was listening to inxjs talk about how they experience sex and attraction and it was completely foreign once again   something i thought was universal is not it sounds like se experiences both attraction and sex completely differently than us i hope to also ask high se users also for some of this you might want to think back to when you were experiencing attraction for the first few times here  s what i want to know   what clues are there for you that you are attracted to someone    what happens in your mind and in your body to let you know      to what degree does sensory input    someone  s smell   feel   physical attributes    tell you that you are attracted      to what degree does someone  s mind and heart attract you      is attraction completely separate from feelings for a person    or are they pretty much one and the same    i am not quite sure that i m getting to the heart of what i want to know it was hard for me to pin point what was so different about the way that inferior se experiences attraction and i  ll be super curious to see what you guys say and also to see what higher se users say but first lets go with this for us so that i can fine tune my questions 
istj,okay   it  s gonna be long    please read until the end i beg you   so you can understand the dynamic of our relationship    i was in a relationship with an <type> male for about half a year now   he is a dermatologist in his early   s   i am an <type> or <type>    i seem to use fi and ne equally   ca n t really identify myself but i know for sure i use fi ne si    i m      he is my first <type> ever and to be honest i am quite new to this personality type as i  ve never engage or interact with one before we met on instagram   i invited him to have a drink with me because i was interested   but he turned me down   he said he does n t like drinking he ca n t be out late at night   and he does n t know me that well i did n t care much about it   i just brushed it off as him not interested but he kept the conversation going   some days he even sang me songs as voice recordings   he liked all my photos   watched my stories   so i guess he  s interested    he always asked me how my day was   before i know it talking to him had become a routine   this had been going on for    more days he never asked me out but i gave it another chance and invited him to have dinner at my place   surprisingly this time he decided to come the first meeting      the honey phase    i cooked pasta and made some cocktails with my own recipes   it was    pm he apologized in advance that he was going to be late   i did n t mind it because i understood he had a long day the first thing he said to me was that i looked better in person   so i just complimented him back for having a nice dimple but he quickly denied that it was not a dimple but a scar   he ate my pasta and told me i was great cook   he  s not a drinker and yet he drank cocktail i made   we had red wine after but we struggled to open it   i had no wine opener but he tried every way to open it until we could drink haha   he never stay out late at night but there he was breaking his routine to see me   i was amazed at how much he was trying to impress me   everything just felt so right by   am we started to sing karaoke in my small room did n t care about the neighbor   and when he put his arm wrapped around my neck   it felt a sense of security   and when he touched me i felt the gentleness upon his gaze   and when he kissed me on the lip it seemed as time had stopped at the moment and that is when i realized i  ve fallen in love   we had sex that night i did n t want to do it much but he was touchy i still had no idea whether he felt the same way   the next day he started giving me nickname my sweet chef i was taken by surprise   and then spontaneously he wanted to come and see me again   i had no idea what was going on that i asked what are we    are we together    and just like that without any hesitation he said yes the relationship he helped me take care of my hair   my skin   gave me products   and drove all of the way to my office just to drop it for me he gave me good advice   when i said i wanted to eat salmon   he bought it for me and we cleaned my kitchen together he taught me to be more organized   and practical   taught me things i never knew and i taught him creative things back   we  ve always been supportive of each other   he helped me with money   i also learned that he has a skin disease psoriasis on his legs that  s the reason why he ca n t drink beer   or be near people who smoke   i got protective each time someone smoked near him i also helped him with his paperwork and he appreciated it so much he started to become more of himself yeah   at first i had a hard time understanding   but he explained to me he ca n t be who he is n t   i have to accept him as who he is   he got annoyed each time i asked a lot of questions   he mansplain me and always lectured me though being younger than him i do n t mind learning from him through this   because i admit i m not the most organized and neglect my health alot he  s very judgemental   robotic   he never expresses his emotion   and he never once say he love me but his action said otherwise   i  ve never seen anyone so discipline   workaholic   and family oriented   very traditional   we only have time to meet once a week and yet he prefer his personal time over me   i did n t take it well   i had a hard time understanding why the need to be alone when you can be alone with me    we always fought about that   where is the time for me    we do n t even see each other every day and when he has time   he spends it alone   went to cafes   or cinemas   sigh i felt alienated from his way of thinking   someday i do n t even know who he is   and someday he is the sweetest but there  s no spontaneity and everything needs a plan   he was so committed and disciplined to his goal but we  ve come to terms with it that we are   very different individuals with different mindsets and personalities there  s no lies or pretenses   he  s always brutally honest   he would say it even if it hurt my feelings but this gave me no trust issue at all   i trust him whatever he says the breakup   on the week leading to it   we went to watch a movie together   it was dracula the last voyage of the demeter   we enjoyed the movie so much   during the movie he finally touched me again and gave me his hands it  s been forever since he last touched me because of no public display of affection i saw that his psoriasis was spreading to one side of his eyebrow   i was scared for him   but he told me he got it under control   it spreads when under stress   stress    i asked   why do n t you tell me what  s going on lately    he just said if he tells me nothing gonna change i ca n t help him anyway   when he faces with problems he shuts me out and needs to be alone in his personal space this ofc pains me because knowing i m alive and i ca n t do anything to help him and then out of nowhere that same week   he told me does n t want to be in a relationship anymore   i felt like my world was falling apart   and everything was crashing down   i pleaded with him to not make this decision now   but he said it  s for the best   he said i am a good person   very vibrant   kind and caring something he  s not and that i should find someone else that could love me better and could treat me better   he had alot on his plates right now   and he ca n t be afford to be in a relationship   he wants to be at peace with his mind and need his time ofc so for him   i sacrificed this beautiful relationship just for his mental and well being   even if it  s mean i have to ruined myself a million little times post breakup   the next day i quitted my job on the spot   i was depressed   i had no motivation to do anything at all   i cried to sleep   it was killing me so hard   it was a sad october   i shut myself inside my home for almost   days   that  s how bad it was but he texted me and ask is everything ok    it  s like he telepathically knew what i was going through or maybe he just felt the same   but i did n t go into details i just tell him i was fine   i just quit my job   i did n t tell him i m having a hard time   i afraid he will think it  s his fault   i did alot of reflect back and i realized that he loves me so much   just not the way i wanted   but in his own languanges   i  ve finally understand him more and more after researching about <type>   i also realized i forced my ideal onto him so much   i felt like i am the worst   i wish i had a time machine   and a couple of day later he texted me again   sharing news about the flood in my neighborhood   showing concern if i am okay or affected by the flood and i felt it in every pieces of my bones that he still love me i m not daydreaming or being delusional and i refuses to believe feeling changes overnight     then kept our usual routine going   saying good morning or goodnight but with just more space and limit conversation and i just do n t have the previlege anymore he still update me on where he goes or who he  s with   and i always trust him   sometimes i even forgot that we have broken up   but some days he  s so cold toward me and when i tried to move on   he texted me again and when i do n t reply he doubled text or even triple text and even try to wish me good luck on my business or my events i have no space to move on if   person ca n t be apart then they are not meant to be apart   but he has made it clear that he wants to distance himself from me and want to focus on his peace of mind he did alot of stuff to relieve his stresses   like watching cartoons or going to cafes   one day i got him to open up   he finally told me   his health is deterioating   his family pressure him get married   he is trying to pay his debts   while supporing his whole family please ask no more he said   i always told him i am here for him   then he said he afraid to be vulnerable and fragile in front of me so he has to be alone to solved his problem then shut me out again i gave him his space and time because i finally got closure i wanted   and understand more of the situation now   and i felt like i will move mountain to be with him a couple of day later he

intj,which type usually respects the <type> finds the <type> interesting    which type does n t usually like the innate traits that come along with the <type>    
isfp,have you ever seen an <type>  w      whenever their laptop breaks    they cry hysterically   they scream like young children   they kneel down and pray to the internet god that their laptop will fix again   they tightly hug and caress their dead laptops and make sexual moaning noises   they buy a facebook marketplace windows xp laptop    because modern laptops are too ugly for their fi se sx  aesthetic taste    only to find that the internet barely works and then they cry even more   they contemplate suicide   they rely on others to fix their laptop because they  re ti blind   and they claim that they prefer computers over people when in reality the opposite is the case because they vent to others relentlessly and this is all because they urgently crave external validation on personality database and reddit    snapchat and tiktok are for <type>  s    due to a  w  fix and a   wing they do n t care about using the internet to research drugs on erowid    wannabe <type>      learn dutch on duolingo    wannabe <type>    and reluctantly and tediously do their mechanics write ups on google classroom    wannabe <type>    
esfj,not going to lie   when i check on these threads and things move soooooooo slowly and there  s like nothing new ever i m totally like i wish orion  uk and suntide and any other <type>s out there were here to just catch up like how  s everyone  s day going or whatever else is on your mind ha   i m such an <type> lol
intp,after searching a lot for my type i finally can rest comfortably   knowing i m an <type> i had various doubts and was very skeptical but i managed to slowly understand why i m <type> and why some parts of the description did n t match after this   i have one last challenge for myself being able to describe my own personality let  s do it first of all   let  s clarify something first mbti ca n t describe a person  s behavior   tastes   dreams or interests entirely with perfect accuracy two persons of the same type can be completely different but there are always some common behaviors that some types of people can share   which can be described and analyzed by their cognitive processes it does not mean that a person of type x will act the same way in every situation y this means there can be some exceptions for everything that i may write here <type>s are defined by their   principal functions ti   ne   si   and fe let  s see a summary of each one ti stands for introverted thinking   but i prefer to call it subjective reasoning i like to call it that way because basically it is exactly what ti does ti is a judging function which means it will judge every information that <type>s may collect as their first function   it means that it works in hardcore style   so an <type> will only really absorb data that is accepted by ti ti is logical but it does not mean you are a supercomputer like some descriptions may make you feel like it just means that you like to pick information   deconstruct it   analyze each part of it and    if needed    deduce the bigger picture of it or a solution to a problem ti also likes categorizing things and all this comes so naturally for <type>s that they do n t even realize they are doing it also because it  s subjective   people wo n t see you doing it ne is extraverted intuition i did n t have a special name for it   but with some help   i do now objective possibilities ne is the primary way the world sees you   this is usually what is being shown to people    because it  s extraverted    ne is the primary way that you gather information ne is like that kid with hyperactivity who just ca n t sit and stay quiet for   minutes but just inside their mind because people may sometimes question if <type>s are really alive it just wants to explore the world and everything but unlike se   it wants to explore ideas and concepts in an abstract way   rather than using the   senses in the <type>  s case   it means that ne serves ti feeding it with new information to judge for the <type> it  s normal to be able to connect various ideas easily and think outside the box   being able to see outside the box and predict outcomes to his and other  s actions and learning by others  experiences si means introverted sensing think in a hard drive   that is how si works most for <type> an hd every data collected by ne and judged by ti will be stored with si because ne is focused on ideas it may be kinda negligent with the physical world si help to remember the mistakes from the past so <type>s can act right when they encounter the same problem in the next opportunity not only that   it helps you to interpret the data you experienced with your body and store it but it wo n t be super detailed because it  s underdeveloped also   <type>s are prone to neglecting physical necessities like eating or sleeping fe is the last one   extraverted feeling which i would call objective ethics fe is focused on aiding people   is the part of <type>s that prevent them to be robots but because it  s the last one   it  s even more underdeveloped   which means they want to help people but do n t have any idea on how to give emotional support if you talk with some <type> about your problem   they will probably give a logical solution to it okay   let  s now talk about how this works in real life socializing <type>s tend to live in their own heads it  s common for them to be completely oblivious to their surrounds my point here is that they are so used in being absorbed in their thoughts that socializing is n t always a priority but this does not mean that <type>s do n t like people or hanging out sometimes when they are socializing   people   as i said   will usually perceive their auxiliary ne this means they will be that quiet person observing everyone talk   with calm curiosity will make some well timed jokes and then get back observing then they will be completely distracted by some random thought triggered by a topic that will lead to another and another and another topic inside their head after several minutes they will try to catch up on the actual topic or discuss what they were thinking   only to get his friends confused about how he could get so far away from the first conversation but behind that is his ti   holding him back and analyzing everything   every time that  s why ne wo n t be so intense as it would be in a ne dom   they will be much more concerned in being accurate in everything they do or talk than being creative and active while that happens si will help the <type> to remember what not to do or talk   based on past experiences   will also help them remember about that interesting article they read in wikipedia that no one cares about and fe will be helping them care or try to care for others   some <type>s may be that kind of person that laughs about a joke that someone made and no one in the group was hearing because they were so focused on talking at the same time an <type> with minimal fe can be that type of person who wants to be kind and nice to everyone   not knowing how to show boundaries to others or being rude when trying to <type>  s biggest weakness is its lack of emotional intelligence just like anyone <type>s experience deep and intense emotions but do n t know how o deal with it they usually ignore   suppress or try to analyze it with ti this leads to being bad at coping with stressful situations   so bad that they do n t even realize sometimes that they are stressed until it  s too late when <type>s reach their limits they can become overly emotional and express an exaggerated response to conflict or isolate themselves into their mind   which can lead to being over analytical and repetitive   thinking about the same problems in an endless loop decision making their approach to making a decision is basically problem solving but ti is a very exigent function and wo n t just accept any solution it needs to be above all accurate   not just efficient or ethical so <type>s can take a lot of time to actually make a decision   depending on the complexity of the problem their main approach is to gather some time alone to think they will try to use ti and si to solve   considering fe when needed    but not much    if this is not sufficient they may ask for help   but not to solve the problem   they wo n t easily accept other  s solutions because <type>s only accept their own reasoning    unless the solution makes sense for them    they will usually ask somebody for more information or try to explain their thought process to get an opinion   which is ne in action people may think that they want external validation   sometimes it  s true   but usually   they are just testing their ideas and thoughts probably anything that the person try to say   the <type> will already know but it  s useful for the <type> to do that so they can test the possibilities before deciding something their decision process is so careful that after taking a decision   they become very stubborn and wo n t accept counter arguments easily because they probably tested all those counters before alone but if needed to make a fast decision in a problem they never dealt with   they wo n t know how to act properly   which can appear as they are some kind of dumb weirdos and making <type>s stressed and sometimes disappointed with themselves probably a well developed ne can help <type>s to deal with this kind of situation romance <type>s can be kinda hard to deal with in a relationship   depending on which type the partner is because they will usually require time alone to think and focus on doing their stuff also   <type>s can be disorganized as hell they are usually oblivious to how messy they are and even when they notice   <type>s do n t really care but because they care for their partner and try to always understand others   they may usually work on this they value creative and intellectual partners and will probably be exigent in that aspect they are also very laid back and value freedom from both sides career i  ve only seen two types of <type>s until now the ones who take a career very seriously and the ones who do n t give a f ck <type>s will often prefer careers that avoid the need to make a physical effort the stereotype says that they tend to prefer science and technology   but they can be anything that catches their interest    just like any type    the problem is that they get bored easily when they feel there is a lack of challenge in their field there is also <type>s who prefer to work on jobs that do n t need much effort and time investment   so they can focus on their personal pursuits in their free time that  s it guys   hope you liked i tried to make a more human   realistic type of description   instead of the super genius with no emotions stereotype i took into consideration my own experiences and others i  ve seen on the internet i m an <type>  w    so i m not sure if it will work with other enneagrams 
istj,hello fellow <type> females   please help this guy in distress i  ve been dating this <type> girl for the past   months at the beginning it was great   she was n t the most exciting women in bed but there was a deep connection and that mattered more than anything else we had sex pretty often   basically every time we saw each other now things changed a lot   even though we spend the entire weekend together   nothing happens between us when we go to bed together   she just falls asleep cuddled with me this has been eating my heart alive   even though she is just right there besides me   i feel a great distance between and makes me feel unwanted it  s horrible   i m not even seeking sex   just some sort of intimate connection i  ve raised her attention to it   i  ve been very comprehensive   i told her that i have needs and feelings too she basically gets on her nerves very quickly and tells me she is not in the mood for it and in should respect that i tried explaining her   like many things in life   even though we are tired or not in the mood   sometimes when we start we end up getting into the mood and enjoying it she did n t seem to understand at all and went south with the argument so i dropped it fellow <type> ladies   how do you approach intimacy    should i expect this to be just a phase    i m afraid this is not something i  ll be able to tolerate in a regular basis 
isfj,o o i m a   and test as <type> but i see a ton of similarities between me and <type>s what would be the difference between an <type> and an <type>    i am confident in my ability to just figure things out as i go along   i m messy and disorganized   but like to have a goal to concentrate efforts on do n t really have detailed plans or to do lists and i do n t make plans for the next day or anything rules bother me   being told what to do bothers me as well i also do n t like it if i have to take care of someone else imo people should learn to handle themselves   but will help despite this o o details kinda bother me   i just want the big picture or the bottom line so i know what i m dealing with before i address any details details kinda frustrate me especially if there is no end to it other then that pretty much <type> 
infp,hello   i am an <type> woman i met an <type> a few weeks ago and it  s been the most surreal encounter i  ve ever had so many things needed to be aligned for us to meet and i just felt this huge attraction for him i like to compare it to the before sunrise movie    and knowing they are both our mbtis   it makes even more sense    i was traveling to another country   i was supposed to meet with friends for dinner this <type> is also from abroad and he was meeting a friend of a friend that i was supposed to have dinner with so we ended up having all dinner and drinks together he did n t specifically look at me or interact with me even though he seemed to interact with everyone else we are both taken so i did n t think much more than that    now looking back and reading about <type>s it makes total sense because he did tell me after   that he thought i was cute when he first saw me so i guess he acted this way on purpose    the night passes by and we end up in the kitchen talking i start to feel a vibe but i just think he is a bit tipsy he started to share with me his deepest thoughts even though we just met at this point   i m thinking he is cute and had the sweetest worries   i could tell he cared a lot about his family and people around him and i liked that a lot about him the conversation went on i just really liked what we were talking about from religion to my relationship issues with my bf   i felt such a strong connection and i liked that he was so emotionally developed and empathetic   i  ve never met a guy like this i could sense he was attracted to me because he became touchy and i just felt so attracted to him too i never felt so emotionally connected with someone i just met by the end   we were just the last ones left   everyone left or went to sleep the tension was real he started softly by telling me that he was happy we met and how close he felt to me even though we just met but he ended up telling me how attracted he was to me and after that   it  s just like he had no filter   and he would just go on about his feelings towards me i was so taken aback at how transparent he was about how he felt and i felt the same about him even though i think we both really wanted to act on it   we decided to leave it like this and not do anything because we were both taken during this whole time   he was just very respectful we slept one hour   had coffee together at a coffee shop in the morning while waiting for the others to wake up i was wondering if i would still feel as attracted to him but i did   i think he did too because he seemed so nervous during the coffee and he would continue asking me tons of deep questions about life i knew i was leaving the country soon so that was going to be the only time we would see each other when i left   he felt distant and i guessed it was because his friend was there and that was the one and only time i saw him later on   i initiated a conversation with him on instagram but after a few days   he told me in the nicest way possible that out of respect he will stop talking to me   that he needs to go back   settle and think about it he said he  s good in his relationship but maybe sometimes connection happens and we ca n t help it i really understand how hard our situation is and i also need to process it on my side and decide what i want to do with my relationship a few days later   he unfollowed me i saw him look at my stories once after that but not since i later tried to guess his mbti from the conversation we had and i think he  s an <type> it makes even more sense knowing that it  s supposed to be one of the best mbti matches for an <type> so my question is what goes into the mind of an <type> in this kind of situation where you are taken but attracted to someone else    thanks a lot for making it to the end of my story   
intp,post your bad jokes here jokes that you  ve heard that were bad   or jokes that you  ve told that were just bad    it  s up to you what bad means      i am working on a lengthy one now    a long story joke    but here  s a smaller one  til i get done with that one a couple is driving down a highway in texas    for those not in us aware   it is the largest state in the us   sans alaska    their car runs out of gas   but they see a large building ahead who knows    it could be a gas station they decide to take the trek together unfortunately   the walk was much longer than they expected seconds turned to minutes   minutes turned to hours   and well you get the gist finally   after several hours   they arrived the structure was so large   it looked like a small    but close    building from so far away   a large sign hung from the massive doors on the front gym  s steaks what kind of name is that    the couple thought pushing through the massive door   they are greeted and finally directed to a table the table was big enough to hold at least eight people   and it was clearly the smallest table around ironically   there were very few people in sight drinks    the waiter asked after giving them an order a simple coke and water   the waiter left   leaving two very large menus the man turned to his wife   and said i guess what they say is true   everything is bigger in texas they chuckled   and looked at the menu after a few minutes the waiter returned with massive drinks in hand he set down the two gigantic jugs   and asked   sowly   arrre y all ready fer yer ordah    smiling to themselves   they each ordered a steak and sides the only thing really available here and the waiter moved on looking around   they began to comment an incredibly large rocking chair was on a center stage the chair was at least the height of two tall men   and the width of one as well a small ladder was propped up beside it   as if people actually used the rocking chair magnificent trinkets adorned the wall yokes for oxen at least twice the normal size   black and white pictures of dogs and horses twice the size of humans    obviously photoshopped      and a few tools at least thrice their normal size after talking a while on the subject and absolute absurdness of the environment   their steaks finally arrived the waiter   holding a massive tray   lowered it for the couple to see there   sitting on the massive tray   were four massive plates two huge steaks   and two heaping piles of various sides they were so surprised   neither said a word was this customary    they thought as they stared the waiter placed the plates on the table and left a few speechless moments past   until the woman finally said i guess it is true they both began to laugh quietly after a while   the steaks began to disappear the waiter stopped by several times   and finally both had consumed quite a lot and quite a bit of their drinks   where are the restrooms    the man said   standing and holding his stomach the waiter told him   and off he went following a very long hallway   the man was amused by all of the pictures and other devices along the walls he passed several doors   each very large but without signs did he say the second to last on the right    he took a guess   and opened that door it was completely dark   but he remembered the man saying something about the light being off tile floors   so must be it he stumbled in   trying to find the light switch   but it was so dark finally   he slipped and fell into a large swimming pool panicking   he shouted do n t flush   do n t flush   oh my god   please do n t flush   as he climbed out of the pool    later he realized why it was called gym  s steaks    so ya   that  s a bad one for ya i am terrible at telling story like jokes irl   so post your bad ones    and experiences    here   
entp,so i had a horrible couple years   culminating in a bad breakup i dropped everything   and started working on relationships   which turned into emotional work   which turned into spirituality i was running from my feelings to the point where i could only express frustration   anger   and happiness but i stopped running from them   and experience them all   and process them all because of that   my decision making processes changed a little bit i m more empathetic   more careful with my words   more outgoing   and less bound by logic all the brains are still there   i m still adept at what i do   i m just a lot more emotionally stable it makes me question whether or not i m still an <type> it seems that my hiding behind logic was to protect my inner emotional state i never showed anyone authenticity   because if they ca n t see my inner being   then they ca n t hurt it i saw the descriptions about <type>s being uncomfortable with the irrationality of their emotions   but there  s nothing rational about emotions so it appears to be some sort of coping mechanism ingrained in the <type>   to protect itself from its own feelings i m just curious if anyone had any similar experiences i do n t think i  ve ever spoken with an emotionally mature <type>   it seems to be an oxymoron or maybe i just was n t looking for it unable to see it 
istj,i  ve read thru many of your threads   including the stickies   and have learned a lot but one thing i ca n t understand is   if an <type> man is clearly into you   why is he so passive as far as pursuit goes    my <type> lives     hours away and owns a few successful businesses   therefore   he is very busy however   when i ask to see him   he will drive out to my place or vice versa   no problem he consistently initiates texts with me on a daily basis   has told me he sees a future with me   i check all his boxes   and he wants to build a home family with me but he never asks to see me or plans a date it  s like there  s no urgency on his part it drives me crazy and absolutely baffles me as an <type>   i usually end up with aggressive and passionate men who go from      right away and pursue me with gusto so this whole slower than a snail with a broken leg thing is really hard for me to understand conversation with him is easy   but i am leery as to how to approach this with him i know i need to be direct   but i also have read that patience is the key so my question is do <type> men prefer to be pursued by the women they  re interested in    and if so   what  s the best way to do this without overwhelming or pressuring him    if he  s not actively asking me out   should i assume he  s not interested    very confusing if you could shed some light i would greatly appreciated fwiw   we  re in our   s and have been dating   months with a break in between due to communication issues   which we are resolving very well now we are exclusive but not committed    he says relationships take time to develop commitment is a huge step    
isfj,first i must warn this is a   min long read   if you got through it all   i deeply appreciate it   this is the <type> part of a self reflection project which i write how <type>s have influenced and helped me grow as a better person i hope for this blog to be a positive contribution to the mbti community the mastermind the protector thanks in the advance for the read and feel free to comment   
intp,<type>s   i m interested in your personal experiences here if this might be unhelpful to you then please pass it by this question pops into my mind sometimes   and lately i  ve had too much time to think    never a good thing    so please help me out i realize that any type can go through these things events   and i do n t think the trauma part   especially   would create an <type>   however i wonder if there is any link between an <type> and these possible past events current situations also take this as a complete question   as i realize that these issues may have been addressed separately    but not together that i am aware    elsewhere on the forum   have you ever thought you might have high functioning autism    been tested    researched it    or do you know nothing about it or simply have n t had any interest in it      this could be a sensitive one   so do n t answer if you  re not comfortable   and i do n t need details sorry and thanks in your past have you suffered some form of abuse    emotional physical    which you feel has impacted the way you function in your current relationships    if you have any   let  s face it we  re introverts and sometimes get caught up in our work         have you been through trauma which you feel has changed your personality      if you ca n t relate to any of the above points   now is your time to say so feel free to tell me off for this post   but only if you  re an <type>    cause i literally ca n t handle criticism in any form from other types at the moment i e actual logical responses and not self defined logical responses are welcome here    
istj,hello   im curious what hobbies or interests you have the reason is some of the description for <type> seems way off to me i mean i like art and stuff hate accounting ok i have had weird hobbies i like wood working   made a few guitars play guitar drawing    d modeling   animation   rock collecting lapidary   and i love camping but only if its waaaay out in the middle of nowhere i dislike accounting and sports does this contradict the basic <type> personality    
estp,this is not a type thing   however   throughout my life <type>s have always helped me   saved me and even push my limit at some point yet at the same time their generous nature and heroic actions are clearly something i strive to be i can give lots of stories about the <type> teacher who pushes me not to get spoiled and saved me from an injury when a ball was about to hit me the man who fulfilled me    psychologically unstable and yet still saved me from falling off a bridge and life threatening events      the woman whom i admire that spoiled me with expensive clothes and lent me money throughout my childhood and helped my mother financially because we were n t so fanciful like the rest of the neighbourhoods but she manage to always give us these expensive clothes that i will never forget until this day uhm and also the bully   i do think he helped me    not really    but still   i think even if he was immature   there were heroic qualities that no one gets to see in him since he was misunderstood if there are stories about <type>s that people would like to share   you may write them down 
isfp,an e friend typed me <type> because of my nascar poems    they look like an intuitive sensor thing   a sensing interest combined with and intuitive thing   as sports are an s interest and poetry  s more likely to be an n interest    and my stories online she  s read   but someone thought i had <type> writing on quora and another quoran thought i seemed si dom there so   what are your signs someone  s not an <type>    like what are things that someone does does n t do that make them not <type> in your eyes    
estp,<type>  s are amazing because figured we needed some self loving   as if we do n t get enough around here 
enfj,anyone here watch anime    i used to a bit but i always got attatched to the charecters and got sad when it ended so i decided to slow down on it if you have mention if you get emotional w it or some good anime  s i guess my favorite is shuffle   
enfp,saw oppenheimer last night i think it is nolan s masterpiece it was so well told   brilliant in telling   in acting   visualization   the works what a great way to tell this story   that he was already getting judged by others made it so that i didn t have to worry about judging him myself   but could see why the decisions made were made and that the consequences were felt by most of those involved i wanted to see the barbie movie this morning   but my girlfriends and i are gonna try for next week greta gerwig hopefully won t disappoint a fellow <type> i never touched barbie s growing up i hate the smell of plastic i don t think nostalgia is a requirement 
estp,hello everyone hope you doing good need your advise about my  year relationship im <type> girl in a relationship with <type> boy and we were living together the last months unfortunately the last  months i got into volunteer thing about strays and spent all my energy there i had my job and at the end of the day o got no energy for my boy the sex got away i was a little bitchy to him because of all the stress i was dealing with and things didnt go well but we were ready to go for vacation and leave all behind whem somehting else happen i reported to police a neighbor who lives near to his parents house because he has his dog always tight on a leash wont explain further he didnt like that for many reasons amd that was the peack point to call out all my bad behaviours and the sex thag got away the last two months and he broke yo with me he asked to pack my stuff from his house today is the second day that we do n t talk i have moved to my sister i told him so many times to give a atry and i wont do the same things he says thay he wants his freedom and need time to find himself and he is sure that we ll be togther in   or   or    months but he has break up with me again and he gave it a try the last time what should i do       i really love him and i know i was bitch the last months should i give him time       he does n t look good too he told me he does n t sleep well one day he had a hangover from many beers he also started cigarettes again 
intp,i  ve noticed i miss hear what people say often i m not deaf or anything lol i do n t know maybe its because i m not always fully listening i could be thinking about something or i just think someone said something which they did n t then i only half hear what they say it could just be me on this one 
estp,i was reading the profile of the typical sociopath and i could n t help but to notice that some of the things on the list sound somewhat similar to some of the common <type> personality descriptions here  s the list glibness and superficial charm manipulative and conning pathological lying lack of remorse   shame or guilt a deep seated rage need for stimulation living on the edge verbal outbursts and physical punishments are normal promiscuity and gambling are common callousness lack of empathy poor behavioral controls impulsivity early behavior problems juvenile delinquency usually has a history of behavioral and academic difficulties promiscuous sexual behavior infidelity grandiose sense of self worth lack of realistic life plan parasitic lifestyle tends to move around a lot or makes all encompassing promises for the future here  s the website if you want to read the entire page   mcafee cc bin sb html i should mention there were plenty of other traits that i did n t add because a lot of them do n t necessarily sound similar to the average <type> description so do you think <type>s are more likely to have sociopathic traits       
esfj,i recently got to know an <type> guy in a game and well   i must say he is a pretty awesome i enjoy the affection   the attention he s also quite funny i like him a lot but i seem to piss him off more often than i should ok so i have this tendency to think too deeply about things and i work through my emotions with people   on the fly and i ve done this a couple of times with him and he s always not taken it very well i used to date an <type> and <type> and both were super calm and walked me through it i m guessing it s because he s more emotionally in tune most recently   i got mad at myself for not performing well in a team fight and said that i was unhappy i have told him that it s not him that s making me upset    though he s in the equation because he could have joined me in the battle    but he seems to be taking it personally and i suspect it s because he can t fix the situation and make me feel better he has said that when i m happy he s happy and i think i legit pissed him off he s been curt and said he doesn t know how to talk to me    in case it trips me up    he also said i think too much and asked me to stop doing it    i e delving into things that are not true and not there    i can feel the unhappiness so how do i approach him should i leave him alone    i already said sorry 
istp,we all know what the stereotypical <type> female would look like robot   butch   skulking about   etc let  s put a rest to this a i nonsense if you  re female and an <type>   post a picture of yourself so we can see what you look like i am an <type> woman   and i m extremely curious to see how many <type> females on here there are i think our type gender would be pretty hard to find blushed added by moderator this thread has been merged with <type> male pics so we can get a co ed view of all the awesome <type>s 
enfj,hey all   i was wondering if any <type> guys are sexually submissive it seems like most <type> men are naturally inclined towards taking care of their partners   and that usually manifests as dominance in the bedroom but i want to know if it s the opposite for any of y all 
esfp,as the title says   does <type> want you to go through the same things as you put them trough    
intp,you go to wikipedia to look up one thing and end up spending hours on the site reading you would download the internet into your mind if you could you know more inside your head than you do on the outside you have a great idea   but you  ll do it tomorrow any others    
istp,hi <type>s you seem so rational and non emotional you also do n t seem to react as much unless it  s one of those few things important to you it  s hard to know whether there is a sea of emotions flowing regularly through you that is unvoiced   or if what you see is really what you get    agree   disagree    thoughts    
isfp,hi   i  ve taken the autism quotient test at least a dozen times    which   admittedly   is not a substitute for getting assessed by a professional      and i  ve always tested positive for asperger  s    like   way above the cutoff    my few friends assure me i m not aspergian    that  s a real word   i think    and i even went to a crappy psychologist who flipped through a little book and told me   after hemming and hawing for five seconds   that i do n t have asperger  s i m wondering though if any of you <type>  s have run into this    i e testing positive for asperger  s       i  d think <type> would be one of the primary personality configurations who  d test positive for asperger  s in case you  ve never taken the test and would like to   links to the test are below    the first link was n t working for me today   but it  s the one i usually take    wired      take the aq test asperger test    aq test    pie palace
isfp,sort of a long post   but this is my first time dating an <type> person and could use some advice i m a    year old gay <type> male in june        i went on a couple dates with    year old <type> male    let  s call him taylor    who is finishing his residency and will be starting a new job summer      after the second date   he was forward with me and said he was n t up for a relationship at the time i was new to my city at this point and thought we got along well enough to make a new friend   so i said i was okay with doing that if he wanted so up until september      we were strictly platonic friends i also learned after the fact he had only dated one guy in his life for   years   who ended up cheating on and ending things with taylor shortly before we met however   i always thought there was something still there i ended up acting on this one night in early september and since then we have been casually dating for the last few months he also ended up admitting he had interest on his end   but did n t want to mess up our friendship and never acted on it    which part of me is still worried about    we  ve hung out way more frequently than we did prior to this   as much as his residency schedule will allow    was     times a week   with some weeks not seeing each other    i feel like we  ve had a lot of fun and both feel very comfortable with each other he  s openly stated he trusts me and we have been communicating honestly about where we  re at i typically do n t do casual dating as an <type>    it  s difficult for me not to bond with people    and this is the first time i  ve dated someone i had been friends with before   so this experience is new to me from what i  ve read   <type>s usually only casually date to see if someone is a good match for them   but idk if that  s the case here he  s said he  s never done any sort of fwbs before   so i  ve been curious about our situationship and why he  s entered one with me there are times we hang out when we do n t hookup   even when staying the night so i know he  s not solely in it for that aspect as a caveat   he  s likely moving to a city     hours from where we are now in   months recently we talked about where things are going and he said he feels like he does n t want anything serious at this point because he  s not at a place where he can     invest in me like he should he said he likes being with me   finds me attractive   is intrigued by me   and feels like he should want to be in a relationship with me   but is not there he also said if he got to the point where he could totally invest in a relationship i  d be the first person he  d want to try to seriously date he also said i m currently the only person he is making time for besides his best friend   which i know means a lot coming from an <type> we  re going to spend this upcoming weekend together   which is a first    we have n t hung out for multiple days in a row yet    he is n t trying to date or hookup with anyone else right now    has no interest    and has directly told me this   but has said if i felt like i needed to move on and date other people he would understand so i guess my question for other <type>s is how i should approach this situation    i m trying to look at this realistically i know there  s a chance things will not work out in the end however   i believe the things he  s said are true and he  s just not placating me we  ve talked how staying in each other  s lives is the most important thing and if we needed to go back to being friends to maintain that then it was the priority i  ve been on the fence about how long i should give him to feel things out   as i know i wo n t be able to keep myself from getting attached to him after an extended period of doing this while he is making time for me   there are some things i m not sure how to interpret i tend to do most of the date planning   but i know <type>s are n t big into this he  s also sparse communicating between hanging out    can go a week or more without talking if i do n t reach out      but on the flip side the last time we talked on the phone it was for     hours    he did a ton of the talking    he  s told me he does n t like his phone much   and when we  re in person he  s very present and rarely looks at it he also does n t ask a ton of questions about me   but has been opening up more on his end and seems better if we  re just reflecting on ourselves vs me asking about him but on the whole   i get the impression he is way more comfortable with me taking the reins on everything he even waits for me to make the first move when we are hooking up are these typical behaviors for an <type> or red flags    from what i know   <type>s need time and be free from pressure when deciding something major like choosing a romantic partner also   i m sure being cheated on has done a number on his ability to commit i m not in any rush to find a relationship and not really tied down to my city   so there  s a part of me that wants to wait it out and give this a chance while not being blinded by idealism i  ve never had the opportunity to date a friend   and it  s been super nice that we already know each other and can focus on hanging out with naturally learning more personal things i directly asked if maybe i just was n t right for him and he said he did n t think that was the case   and once things were settled he could be in a better place for a relationship i  ve also asked if he wanted to end us dating and go back to being friends   since i  ll be gone for a month over the holidays and it was a good breaking point however   he does n t seem to want to do that is he just keeping me at a distance to know if he is sure there is some sort of future there   or is this just an emotionally unavailable <type>    should i just go with the flow and see how the next   months turn out or should we go back to friends and tell him i m open to things in the future but ca n t sustain the current situation as it is    any straight real advice from <type>s would be greatly appreciated 
intp,well for me anyway anyone else    i  ve not been able to make any of my traits into positives or put them to any good use i wish i was another type no doubt because i have chronic depression and anxiety sucks   
istp,recently   i  ve had a lot of shit i  ve wanted to say here   but none of it really warrants it  s very own thread so think of this as a  <type>s spouting random bull  thread   say one   say twenty all types are welcome ahem      when i was younger    and still quite a bit now    i would deal with my constant sense of loneliness by escaping to my own fantasy world   most things were the same but whatever need i had was filled in some weird   analogous way i still do n t know if that  s me channeling my inner <type>  s ne or if it  s because i m one sandwich short of a picnic      i find replying to facebook events almost impossible i do n t know there  s something constricting about committing to something in a way in which other people can see eurgh      sometimes i think my only friend in the world is my pet bird at least   he  s the only thing which is reliably happy to see me animals people period      i envy some other <type>s ability to tell people what they really think of them i guess i also envy most other <type>s that have better se than me      my favorite time of day is the night   namely when everyone else has gone to bed and i m still awake i love the silence   it really helps me to focus i also like scuba diving for much the same reason      sometimes i wonder if i m missing a point by not really bothering with finding someone to be in a relationship with idk   i just look at people in relationships and wonder if feigning interest in someone i know i would n t have any long term potential with in exchange for intimate companionship is worth it i wonder until i realize that in order to find someone to be in a relationship with that would mean having to get up and talk to people back to screwing around on personality forums making asinine threads then 
enfp,<type>s are supposed to get annoyed   at best   when people start being clingy with them and become detached and give a total cold shoulder if things get really bad the books i  ve read say this is because our emotional circuits are overwhelmed with our own lives   but while i can agree with this on the rare occasion i also get annoyed with clingy people when i know i m in a very emotionally stable place i  ve been trying to think why this is for me i think one of the core reasons is i m on a search for self and authenticity this search does n t involve me obsessively tying myself to anyone   so when people do it to me i find it a bit pathetic to be harsh i know this feeling goes into overdrive when that person asks me to  help  them with an emotional issue   not being able to get over a failed relationship or dating pursuit is a big one   and when i offer what i know is a solution and people do n t take that advice   repeat the same mistakes   or simply do n t want to do what it takes to get out of their place then i have no time for that it  s gotten to the point where i  ve ended friendships and   more commonly   told people if they want to talk with me or hang out with me that subject never comes up again ever any similar experiences    or maybe you guys totally disagree with me on how i hand these situations 
estj,so i met this guy   months back on a dating app   he is an <type> and had recently broken up with an ex of   years considering this   we should have taken things a bit slower but he told me that he and his ex had been drifting apart for months beforehand and that he was over it   and he was pretty convincing so i decided not to worry and just go with it as i  d never had a bf before and i was glad i did because i had never been happier than i was when we started dating we like all the same stuff   music   films   tv shows and have a very similar sense of humour and it felt like we were made for one another even though we are very different people   it felt like we got each other and for me   it was perfect and he told me he felt the same way i mean this guy does n t seem like the type to express his feelings but he would tell me every day how he was so glad he found me and that he had never loved anyone this much before a couple months back he even opened up to me about his dad  s death    which is unusual for him    and cried in front of me    also unusual    it brought us even closer and he continued to make me feel secure and happy in our relationship until one day   i got a message saying he thinks we should take a break   that he had n t been feeling the same way lately and he needed space to figure out what he wants i was confused because he had n t been acting any different and he was the one asking me about going on holiday together only the week beforehand but i agreed to give him space he still insisted on texting all the time during this  break  and still flirted with me   it did n t make any sense so i suggested we stop texting for awhile so he could think and hopefully make his mind up faster the next day he broke up with me and said he just was n t ready for a relationship and he could n t ask me to wait but from recent posts on his social media   it  s pretty obvious he wants his ex back i posted his here because i was curious if any <type>  s might be able to understand his mind and how he changed it so quickly    as an <type>   i find it difficult to understand how someone could be genuinely as in love as he made me believe he was   and then want nothing to do with me the next week is it pointless for me to hold out hope for him changing his mind back again    
esfp,does it bother anyone else that <type>s are generally the comic relief in fiction    both books and movies alike i might be biased   because i obviously look at my own more than any other mbti type   but it seems to me   that if someone is shallow   irresponsible   and a kind smiley prankster   it means they are <type> there might be some characters   that are typed differently elsewhere   nevertheless notably homer simpson simpsons philip fry futurama joey tribiani friends sookie st james gilmore girls serena vanderwoodsen gossip girl jonathan carnahan the mummy samantha jones sex and the city random weasleys harry potter there are plenty i  ve actually found a list with a bazillion characters in fiction sorted by mbti   and there are a couple better developed ones which well developed <type>s in fiction are your favorites    this is the list character list funky mbti in fiction
estp,i m doing this for drunk parrot and to build the <type> community any <type> that comes to perc often feel free to introduce yourself if your new   also introduce yourself that  s what this is all about introductions from there we will build on a conversation here are some questions you can answer to introduce yourself      how old are you         where do you live         what do you do         what do you and your friends do together         what is something you enjoy         you know you  re an <type> because here is mine              united states      i m in college      we sometime just relax and talk we sometimes party but we always have a good time      i enjoy eating   sleeping and anything exiting i also like watching tv      when i first took the test i got <type> it seemed accurate i thought i was various other types for various amounts of time   but <type> makes the most sense to me the more i learned about the theory the more my type became clear 
enfj,more than once in my life i  ve lived up to the <type> cult leader stereotype i have n t ever lead an actual cult that would be too on the nose   but i  ve had my influential moments first one i can recall is when i was about    years old i used to control my brother and the neighbor kids i officiated a wedding between an   year old and a german shepherd its a long story next one was in jr high     th grade    i had this group of friends and in order for them to be my friend they had to eat a disgusting concoction i made which i called a smiley pie they would eat it and throw up usually   and then they could be my friend i also made them watch certain movies     movies that had inside jokes that only   we would get it was wild because we would kind of initiate people to be in our group of friends and i was the leader of this foolery in college i joined an activity group on campus some drama went down and i got elected vice president i left and took almost the entire group with me and started my own organization in hindsight that was an asshole and immature thing to do rookie cult leader mistake i guess any way   there are more examples but these are the ones that stick out that  s all i have for now tell me yours 
entj,it just very recently occured to me that i naturally shift into more of an abrasive hardass persona when dealing with <type>s if i had to explain why   i would say it  s my  th slot te trying to shove its way forward i  ll be honest   i only really typed this up in the hopes that   in saying things   i would end up figuring out the exact mechanics of this phenomenon i  ve got nothin an <type> enters the room and suddenly i m a te gripping asshole oh well 
entj,did you watch the bernie madoff series on netflix    what do you think of madoff and his    billion dollar ponzi scheme    penny for your thoughts 
esfj,i finally met an <type>   she is really cool   i am an <type>   and we vibe in a way that is unreal for the first time in my life   i have felt like someone texts me more than i text them   some traits i notice very friendly and engaging with people willing to speak her mind with no reservations and full confidence no arrogance   just confidence self awareness of her own inner self diminished awareness of the outside world perspective genuine concern and empathy    fe    and emotional response expressive texting   lots of exclamation points and i always know how she feels about anything willing to bring up when her feelings are hurt immediately without letting it sit    it was a misunderstanding    able to reflect humor on an even level    first time i  ve laughed well in a long time    still not a hard laugh   still hurting but close         funny in a natural way not seeking it out or going for a punch line very focused on the person she  s talking to where i deliberately use my fe it is effortless for her knows where to get good food    si ne    friendly to a level where it can seem like very direct flirting i could go on i m sure i m really impressed i ca n t remember a time where i was texted talked to this much   where i felt like it was almost too much   and i do mean almost   and feel   because it could never be too much   but yeah it  s really interesting how this <type> <type> dynamic is i do n t even know where we connect when i first met her it was n t like anything specific stood out something   but what    dunno but then the next time it was like instant good friendship i ca n t connect the dynamic to anything i know it  s so different to me it  s not normal for me   and probably not comfortable to me either meaning   she has all these ideas to do things and so on   and i am down for whatever   but also the amount is not normal    edit not normal for me    her si in creating sensory things    going places   doing things   etc    is her output of her energy   and i am inferior se where i can only handle so much before i feel like i hit my limit it  s so cool writing this is just helping me sort out my thoughts i can tell now   that all the sensory input i  ve been getting    long   frequent texts back and forth with all the alert sound notifications   audio recorded messages she sends   going places and planning to do other things    is a lot for me to take with my inferior se i can handle it   but also at some point my head is stuffed   my se full   needing no more input so i need to find a way to ensure i properly recover in between hanging out   and to limit my sensory exposure during those times   not indulging in anything sensory   instead keeping it like a trickle intake where when i do fill up my se   it  s at the end of the time spent hanging out and then yeah there  s still gonna be a lot of texts after lmao so yeah lol it  s just good anyway   it is awesome to see this personality type in person for the first time    consciously knowing it    and all the dynamics very direct   enjoys listening to other peoples  stories   gives great practical feedback and so much more the si is probably the most interesting component   because it    si    creates sensory experiences going places   doing things   and so on i m not used to this si is the function i  ve had the least exposure to before i m just pulled into doing these things   willingly   but also like i cannot help it   it  s so strange because i have n t had that before   mostly dealing with se users so yeah it  s like alright we  re gonna do this thing this week   and there  s no stopping it   it  s like an excitement or a wave that cannot be stopped and the texts audio messages   i try to be as deliberate as possible in responding in kind to everything i can   and it  s a lot   i still have two audio messages from a few days ago i still need to catch up on   and that  s so unlike me   but yeah lots of exclamation     lol so yeah <type> you guys are pretty cool in my book 
infj,ok   so i tried to get some ideas on the debate forum and it didnt end well so i thought id ask here so this term in modern history we have been studying the arab israeli conflict which interests me greatly so what i would like is to get peoples opinions on the topic   who they believe the purpetrator is or if they both are   personal bias and why   and if you have any good sites or books that i could have a look at that are minimally bias or if not find two wildly bias scripts from both sides also can i get if you feel comforatable your faith and country so i can get a general idea of worldly bias and beliefs opinions on the subject and whether secular or non secular followings change this thanks guys extra questions   do you guys believe that the us would really blow up jerusalem and what sort of implications do you believe would surround it   what sort of religeous and political backlash do you believe would follow such an attack      how do you believe the problem should be solved      should there be a demilitarised zone between the two nations guarded by a neutral force      should both countries be forced to have military caps    
infp,ive possibly made a fecking lot over the years   yet i sometimes wonder weather there is such thing as a poor decision like do they teach us something more valueable and even   was there really any other choice to be made   as in your decision was allready made for you   like some pre determined fate in truth i havnt come to any conclusion   so was wondering if any of you have some poor decisions regrets you care to share do you think they may have shaped your life in a more negative way   are they something you live to regret   or can you see a positive side to it   in the latter years i guess i will start when i was      a friend and i   had a small home made tatoo each by some other kids at school we knew   trying to be cool it was no big deal   just a small cross at the top of my forearm no bigger than maybe an inch the following summer during break i got a saturday job with a friend of my dads   who was a tatooist   being into art   i loved it   i was just tracing out the tatoos for the customers and talking to them   it was a fun and vibrant atmosfear by the end of the summer   the tatooist asked if i wanted a tatoo   and being young and stupid i thought it would be cool as feck   i asked my parents   my mum was rightly dead against it   but my dad said the choice was mine so i went for it   a tattoo at the top of my forearm covering the cross it wasnt something i really thought about   just picked something i thought might be cool anyways im left was a four inch tatoo on my arm that looks like shite for someone who is very self conscious   possibly brought on by another bad decision its been a pane in my life   though now im much older i give less of a shit on the bright side   im ginger   and ye olde firey sod aint my biggest fan   so it dont get an airing that much still i havnt had one since 
istj,<type>  s and <type>  s tend to be considered rival types and having not met many i was just wondering what exactly are the different traits that fuel our rivalry   i get that we  re mostly opposites but what exactly are the worst things <type>  s do that piss you off    
intp,i do it  s not that i do n t like women   i just do n t fit in with the majority of them i ca n t relate   and i find myself having to fake it a bit so that i do n t stick out like a sore thumb i get bored and zone out of conversations i end up hanging out with guys instead i m much more at ease around men obviously i m making huge generalisations here   and there are of course exceptions to the rule some of my closest friends are women    mostly <type>s and <type>s    what about the rest of you girls    do you have this problem too    
infj,hey friends i m at a point right now where i am truly wondering how those of you <type>s fortunate enough to find yourself in fulfilling relationships managed to luck out as you did    i ask this because it seems that i we are so difficult to match with another that we happen to care for perhaps it  s just me i  ve found that few individuals i  ve fallen for in my life   i  ve just been too much too handle or just a bit too passionate never intentionally   but my care for someone once feelings are realized just goes from    to     very quickly   without much in between   and once it  s there it  s hard to conceal i want to make that person feel special and appreciated although i do n t admit it   internally i become idealistic about what we can be become it begins like a dream of sorts   and then it very slowly   and then very quickly becomes a nightmare   because that person has historically always pulled away when they realize this   rather than embraced it my fear of rejection kicks in when intuition says it  s taken a turn for the worst   and it just does not end well it  s a cycle that  s repeated   less and less frequently   but in much more painful ways each time and my hope for things dwindles to the point of just wanting to surrender my heart on a plate each time a very different kind of person   but the same end result no matter the approach things just have n t clicked on both ends on top of this i  ve never had anyone    that i  ve noticed    full on pursue me   not since i was young nobody that  s cared to the point that i could feel and sense it i  ve historically had a couple of crushes cautiously reciprocate interest until in due time it  s diminished but i  ve never been made to feel like anyone  s number one   like i could walk away and they would follow me i do n t expect the intensity i will sometimes give   but i  d hope for something more   and in my    years it  s never come i  ve always been the one leaving the door open   hoping and after everything falls apart   i m the one making some plea that they do n t walk away but they always do and it destroys my world inside i ca n t even listen to comments like keep your chin up   you deserve someone great   because at this point it feels almost cruel like i m being mocked see   it  s not an easy thing any more it affects your perception of self worth and makes you question it   no matter how much you fight it each time the other person walks away   when they meant the world to you   and you loved them unconditionally it  s even more brutal when they said that everything you gave to them was everything they wanted from a guy i ca n t tell you how much that affects you   especially this far into life   when all you want is your life story to start to be something normal something that invokes a smile   instead of a sorrowful and confused look when you have such a reservoir of love and care   and nowhere to put it your life is like an equation that just does n t add up things you see in the movies   where a happy coincidence turns into someone who changes your life forever that shit does n t happen not for me i  ve been more alone than i  d ever wish on anyone people do n t drop in to save the day   or just sit with me   take my hand when i feel i have nothing it  s a one man battle i have a family that does n t get me   and has always severely under appreciated my views or my contributions so i  ve always fended for myself in a way i  ve had no one on my team   who  s believed in me and loved me for who i am   to this day it  s all i  ve ever wanted and after being so optimistic in all my time growing up that everyone deserves and is destined to meet their happiness at some point   whatever that may be   i m having my doubts that it will happen i just do n t see it it  s cold and bleak   and lonely and i do n t know what to do anymore dating sites   all that crap   it feels fruitless and it normally is   because that small talk   coming onto strangers is awkward and unnatural to us i we do n t work that way and the real world is full of people cautious and unwilling to find out what you  re all about   because you do n t exude that social prowess or outward charisma that will get them out of their seat for you establishing new social connections is an extremely difficult process   and no one usually cares enough to walk through all those lengthy steps there  s just no one walking through that door and i m not sure there ever will be can anyone relate    
estp,basically i investigated who would be interviewing me after the recruiter gave me their names i looked them up on linkedin i showed her the women explained its two administrators in their   s i asked her if i should dress like myself in my typical business casual or wear ugly clothes to be more vulnerable looking she said wear ugly clothes and not to dress to impress so she found a sweater blouse thing that id usually pair with something completely different the sweater is perfect it makes me look larger than i am found some outdated but barely worn boots as well yes this could sound ridiculous to people possibly but i do not want to come off overpowering or too bold we found the perfect ugly polished outfit for the interview i will also wear my ugly glasses and put my hair in a low pony
istj,<type> here trying to understand si   so i thought i d ask the si doms directly how do you experience your si    i thought i d share my experience with ti to help   my ti just comes to me   if i m looking at the problem by observing or tinkering the observation is working out the problem logically in the background   unbeknownst even to me then all of a sudden i get a idea   an answer out of no where sometimes one answer   sometimes many   then consciously i pick which answer is the most likely to work and try that if it doesn t work   through trying that idea i ve pulled in more information so i get more accurate ideas and try those till something works but ti feels truly like a light bulb someone just flipped on so how do you experience your fi    
enfp,personally or not if you havent met one   how you would you describe an <type>  w     strengths   faults   fun aspects ect 
entp,<type>s   i m looking for some help i really want to work on my thinking and logic i find myself in trouble and hurting people because i make decisions based almost entirely on how i feel i really do n t want to keep ruining my relationships with people i form them easily   but ca n t maintain them when i hurt people what sort of filters do you use to process your thoughts before you make decisions    anyone can answer this   but i figured if t was all i changed   i would most resemble an <type> 
intp,so far   no one has been able to explain fi to me in a comprehensible way i realize this may not be the best place to inquire since it  s our devil function but all the more reason to attempt to understand it   right    i understand fe to be holistic and harmony based fi had been described as self concerned would it be fair to say fi is more of a subjective function whereas fe is more of an objective one    insight from other types are welcome too of course and especially from fi users    i m talkin  to you <type>s   <type>s   <type>s and <type>s      please provide examples or hypotheticals 
entp,a lot of the <type>s i met flirt a lot   and to be honest i have no idea what is genuine and what is not 
istp,hi i m new to perc but have been messing around on forums for a long time anyway   i noticed that there was n t a thread for new members to introduce themselves    unless i am very much mistaken      so i decided to make one thus i am    years old and live on the east coast of australia with my parents i am currently readying myself for    days of basic military training over the next few months at a barracks down south i like hip hop and i am not black    not that being of any particular racial complexion is a bad thing in any way    any questions    laughing gt styglmah
infp,so i  ve been overweight for most of life and i  ve only realized the true root of my overeating   which comes from eating the food that other people would throw away to remove the burden from them having to get up and throw the food away and the burden of the earth for producing food that has gone wasted    i come from a poor family and was taught this for all of my life    it  s taken me years to ponder this and actually digest that my gluttony comes from a place of selfnessless ever since then   i have learned about fasting and have become comfortable with turning down food i have also come to terms with my mortality and decided that one of my life long goals is to see my body in it  s peak condition before i am no longer able to maintain it and or die    bye bye me    these thoughts have been pushing to have dramatic weight loss and now i m daydreaming about building muscle as now i have turned being fit as something that was optional into something that is important i feel like <type>s would be attracted to the idea of having immense power and never actually using it    unless it was for protecting someone else    as well as being interested    both good and bad    of the feelings that are associated with building muscle   so what do you think    edit also   when i say bodybuilding i also mean weight lifting in general i do n t necessarily mean contorting your body into a super human shape for the sake of looking good but generally toning your body to be better than it once was 
enfj,everyone has questions but they tend not to get asked how about a sticky dedicated to asking us <type>  s any kind of question we  ll answer them as well as we can and as much as we like the believe   we do n t have the answers to infinite wisdom and happiness and definitely no free rice pudding here but who knows if this thread survives long enough i might bring out the kool aid 
infp,so i had this idea for a thread a couple of days ago   and then today i saw jonkay   asking for one   how  s that for synchronicity astralflame    laughing anyway   after a very meager attempt at finding an already existing one   i was unable to   so i made this pretty much what the title says   it  s a dream journal if you  ve had a particularly interesting dream   or a terribly mundane one   or just remembered a dream of yours in general which you feel like sharing   this is the place to do it   i  ve been trying to get into the habit of writing down my own dreams from time to time over the last four years   but i never manage to make it a regular thing hopefully this will change that   but it might mean that i m the only one posting in this thread if you do n t feel like sharing your own dreams   but have some basic understanding of interpreting dreams   you can do that as well anyway   lets start this of shall we    yesterday i had a reoccurring dream of mine i m being chased by a lion there  s rapports of a lion loose in my area   it has escaped from a traveling circus or something like that   and   being the idiot that i am   i decide to go out anyway i never actually see the lion in these dreams   i just know that there  s one wandering around   i even have a clear picture of what it looks like   even though i have n t come face to face with it i m just walking around   when suddenly i get the feeling i m being followed i start acting more and more paranoid as my dread grows   and eventually i m running around   hiding occasionally as i catch my breath this just goes on until i wake up hopefully someone else has a more pleasant one   so get sharing people   
esfp,how <type>    sefx    uses valued se    slot        fi           te           ni           unvalued fe           si           ne           and ti         
estp,i was wondering if anyone has experiences of <type>s being shy and quiet types    i ask because i m considering <type> for my own type because in the past ive been exceedingly talkative   confrontational   center of attention etc   but i m also very very shy and barely speak unless i m in the company of someone i know well    and even then i can be mute    i also like my space and alone time and am quite comfortable being alone i am also a highly empathetic person who never wishes to hurt anyones feelings   so i m tactful   something <type>s aren t known for so   have you experienced a shy <type>    maybe with social anxiety or merely avowing a silence that is more comfortable to them than being boisterous and completely extroverted    
esfj,i noticed there had n t been a music thread for <type>  s and i wanted to make one i m not <type>   but i m interested in your tastes as i have an <type> in my life so what do you guys listen to    
isfj,are <type> less sexually permissive    are <type> very monogamous    what are <type>  s views on one night stands    what do <type>s look for in a relationship    can <type> seperate sex from love    is it very hard for <type>s to get emotionally close to a partner    
enfj,and i quote this longing for the perfect carries over into the careers of <type>  s   who experience some degree of restlessness whatever their jobs and   as with <type>  s   <type>  s have a wide range of occupations which offer success being verbally adept   <type>  s contribute to an unusual level dealing with people   particularly face to face the media   the ministry   and stage and screen are populated successful <type>  s they make superior therapists   charismatic teachers   excellent executives   personalized salespersons areas that would not permit utilization of the intereactional talents of the <type>  s   for example   accounting   should be avoided   otherwise   almost any people to people occupation where personal   sustained contact is involved capitalizes on the personality of the <type> i m currently an accounting major and i love my major but i  ve been having a weird  gut  feeling about it accountants are typically very technical   to themselves and not really into interacting with people of course   in this day and age things are changing and accountants need great managing skills to succeed way beyond the norm i  ve met lots of accountants   auditors   tax accountants who are not like your typical  stay in the background and crunch numbers types  even though the field is changing   i still feel like i m missing something in my major i absolutely love people i want to help people and make a difference in this world the thought of being stuck behind a cubicle preparing tax statements for a corporation or in a room with an audit team checking through invoices made me go nuts     i  ve been searching through these personality tests and careers to see how can i still follow my dream of using my talents in accounting to help people and finally concluded that i should look into becoming a financial advisor or director of some sort of financial literacy program i want to help people plan and figure out how they can save money   manage their finances and maybe even do their taxes here and there i would n t mind being a cpa where i can work on statements and taxes but i also want to advise i even found some jobs with the department of treasury that were centered around spreading financial literacy and i was like ding ding ding     score     my accounting college focuses more on preparing students to work for large accounting firms so i had to dig deep for this kind of information if there is another <type> out there who  s interested in a field that does n t typically fit with their personality type continue to do research there is a career path out there for you you can mix and match your talents with your career goals and make it work for you it might involve you completely changing your major or it might involve you taking a path that  s different from your colleagues    like me      most of my friends are going into public accounting which is great but not really what i want to do another note i am heavily involved in my church i love ministry i love performing and acting and music i am a singer   guitarist   clarinet player and actress you can imagine how aggravated i was when i had to slow down on my involvement in my choir when my accounting classes became to difficult to handle lol i also love leading people most accountants prefer being behind the scenes people like me who become accountants move on past their staff accountant levels to pick up roles as controllers of companies etc etc i do n t mind working in the corporate world too much   but i would prefer to use my talents with a ministry or non profit organization it could even be a for profit company as long as they have a mission of some sort to help individuals heck   i would n t even mind starting up my own thing   i have an entrepreneurial spirit too it  s a long post but i hope it  s of use to someone out there just wanted to share   roud 
estj,hello   i have a friend who is <type>   i think she  s brilliant and i really enjoy her energy and conversations my <type> friend has fallen out with a girl we were both friends with i suspect jealousy is at the core of the problem    the girl is single and playing in the same field as the <type> greater success in attaining male attention    my question is do <type>s get jealous easily and if so what  s the best way to deal with this    thanks   
istj,how do you know whether you  re on the autism spectrum or just an <type>    or even just an introvert       the traits are so similar sounding mainly the procedural   repetitive and very literal take on reading between the line situations you can read more about autism traits here   www autismspectrum org au content characteristics
isfp,since we do n t have a thread for posting our artwork despite our title as  the artists    i thought i  d start one i  ll get the ball rollingg lol i like colouring pencil as you can see haha
istj, i m putting this in the <type>   <type>   and <type> forums to see what types of advice i can get i appreciate anything you have to say       ok   help me please   i am an <type> and my dad is ixtj    unsure between s or n still   he says he tests either way    i am about ready to have a breakdown over the relationship between my father and i it seems like we can rarely spend more than an hour or two alone before we are bickering about something   and sometimes he just throws these awful tantrums if i do n t do something his way now   everybody knows the biggest issue between our two types is      housework and      control my dad loves control he  s been divorced twice    my parents divorced when i was       he has me terrified to actually move out because he says if i do n t follow his schedule i will end up homeless and working at burger king the rest of my life i am almost a senior in college    live at home   attend school online    and i do n t feel like i m ready to face the world at all all i hear about is how i do things wrong luckily i  ve been in therapy for the last two years so i m working on these issues alone   but his constant yelling just still brings me down he is even controlling my therapy   luckily i m about done with my program   but he said after this year no more if i get sick and go to the doctor   all he talks about is how much money i m costing him he pays for all my expenses   which i am truly grateful for    really i am        but i just feel like there  s an emotionally draining price to pay the housework issue is just god awful i  ve gotten better about keeping most of the house clean   but with my bedroom bathroom i really do n t care it is nothing against him whatsoever   but for me to clean is just not my nature i do n t think about putting something away after i  ve used it i toss my clothes on the floor my junk litters the bathroom counter keep in mind   we do not share a bathroom so   unpredictable him says nothing half the time   and the other half he has these temper tantrums he screams at me and orders to listen to his barking he says if i do n t clean or do xyz   he  ll throw away my stuff if i go into my room and lock my door   he screams loud and threatens me he thinks everything i do    or do n t do    is to piss him off he thinks i do n t clean my room to purposely piss him off i just do n t think about it   i also feels like he values his  stuff  more than me if i break something or something gets messed up in the house and i ca n t provide a logical explanation of how it exactly happened   i get yelled at for example   the sprayer on the sink got stuck one morning while i was making coffee while trying to unstick it   it popped off no big deal i immediately called him and let him know so he would n t come home to a broken sink he says it  s fine that night   he gets on my case about how it  really  broke he said he was sick of my friends messing around with his shit and breaking everything um   i was the one who caused it to pop off i am not aware of doing anything unusual to the sprayer or this one is even better    more hilarious   sad   whatever you choose    so my boyfriend comes over one morning and we were planning on cooking a huge breakfast so he helps me make the omelets and we have a good time we did n t break my dad  s stuff   we cleaned it   put it away when we were done that night dad starts yelling at me about how my boyfriend  scratched  his pan    it was a tiny little scratch    well   it happens   plus it  s an item you cook with you expect it not to get scratched    is it me   or does it seem unrealistic    then he yells about how we did n t clean the kitchen enough nothing is ever good enough for him   and his stuff means more to him than me i suppose another issue is finances i  ve been struggling ever since a manic episode caused by a medication last summer   when i blew my savings account now he lent me the money to pay for the debt   and i paid him back in full but i was still having trouble saving my money i finally just saved enough money to pay off all my own department store credit cards    it was quite a bit    and i just tossed them in the trash    last week   actually      so now my savings is scant he asks today   i tell him   and he freaks out he  s saying i ca n t control my money and now wants to control my account i am      i do n t want him touching my own money because i m going to be out of the house soon enough he says if i do n t show him my account   i have to move out by the end of december that  s another thing    lol   long rant   ca n t you tell we just had a fight       he  s always threatening to kick me out if i do n t pick the clothes off my floor   move out   if i do n t put the dishes away immediately   get the out   he  s said that a million times in the last few years   and obviously i m still home go figure his control is just maddening i can totally understand why mom divorced him his girlfriend is pleasant but similar in behavior    to her own son   actually    i want nothing to do with them for the most part he spends most of the time    including nights    at his girlfriend  s so i really do n t have to deal with this anymore but on the inside   i still feel like i m    i know i am plenty capable of getting my ass out of the house   yet it seems like he has this mental leash on me what can i do to make him less jerk like without completely complying to his every demand    i have made a lot of changes in the last year a year ago   i was drinking heavily   having sex too willingly   partying basically   extremely reckless i  ve cleaned up entirely now i have not had a drop of alcohol in over six months   i am getting mostly a  s in my bachelor  s program        gpa      i attend church on a regular basis and am active in the congregation   i m working on becoming a leader in a christian recovery program   i write a blog   i have a great part time job   i take voice lessons in return for babysitting   i have not had sex in a long time   etc i do not think i am still acting like a child my frustration might seem childish    it probably is      but i have made a lot of progress without my dad  s help his behavior is still the same is it hopeless to think our relationship with ever be ok    i love him to death and he shows his love by showering me with extreme generosity but i just feel like things are destroyed and i ca n t salvage a good relationship with him what can i do that  s reasonable    for both him and me    that helps our bond grow    btw   i live with him at home   and it  s just the two of us 
isfp,i might sound like any teenager in the world    though i m       but is it anyone else that always   always   has this feeling of being alone in this world    i mean   i have a wonderful family and a few friends that are awesome   but i constantly have a feeling of having no one to relate to i feel alone in a crowd of people   and the dream is to find a person that just understands it all but it  s like there  s a distance between me and everyone else it  s like i m in a bubble i do n t know if it  s me being mental or if it  s an <type> thing i just feel like i ca n t connect with people all the way and like i m on a different level than everyone else it  s horrible   and hard to explain   but is there anyone here who knows what i m talking about    
estj,you guys do n t get offended   but do any of you have a sense of humor    im married to an <type> roud love of my life is just im not able to enjoy a comedy movie or anything that i might find funny is not funny to her even though she laughs at the simplest of comedy dog sniffs butt dry

infj,hi all i recently split from a partner because she accused me of being selfish for going on a hike alone even after inviting her the second time i went on a hike alone i invited her twice and even offered to change the time i left to fit in better with her schedule she said she was worried i would abandon my wife and children    which we are not and do not have yet    she also expressed in the past that self care and boundaries were inherently selfish things and that she felt uncomfortable with them she comes from a religiously twisted and manipulative controlling environment so i eventually got the point and left she has untangling to do i sacrificed a lot for the relationship and she truly didn t have to sacrifice much friends repeatedly told me as much i didn t realize it until they pointed it out too in wake of the fallout i ve been trying to understand what allows marriages and long term relationships to work there is a common thread of selflessness balanced with independence and autonomy as an individual but where is the line between autonomy as an individual and being selfish    in a relationship context is it actually selfish to go do something on your own even if your partner denies your invites or attempts to work with their schedule    is selfishness even an applicable word for this kind of scenario    i never once felt that way about a partner going and doing something on their own without me i ve always encouraged it   thoughts    
estp,<type> <type> relationships   does it work    any objections    how can i make it work    what sort of person would i have to be and what sort of things would i have to do to keep the <type> extra happy    
intp,i have been thinking about <type>s in fiction and it occurred to me that most <type>s in fictional works are either good or neutral i ca n t think of any villain or anti hero who is an obvious <type>   with the exception of maybe the joker    from the batman comics    although he seems too extroverted to be an <type> it  s as though the <type> is n t seen as a good intellectual villain by the audiences readers of fictional work   there are more than enough <type> villains though hannibal lecter   lex luthor   count dracula   light yagami   emperor palpatine etc the <type>s are sometimes even jokingly characterized as  evil masterminds  but what about the <type>s    we could make for great villains   the type of evil mastermind that would fool the entire world   and an <type> anti hero would be even cooler i think so   what are some fictional villains anti heroes that could be typed as <type>s    what kind of villain anti hero do you think an <type> would be    what are the characteristics of an evil fictional <type>    do n t know whether this has been a thread before   but if it already existed then i could n t find it so i decided to make this into a new thread 
enfj,they tested as an <type> and i even typed them as one as i do see ni in them   but what happened today and in the past has made me wonder   they yelled at someone for    minutes straight today   they said that the person they were yelling at should  ve have been beaten growing up   they threatened to destroy the computer of said person they were yelling at as they were ignoring them while they were yelling at them  b has actually destroyed the phone of her husband once by throwing it out the window as she suspected him of cheating    he was n t                              they think millennials are the worst generation and that they are ruining the world compared to how things were in the past as they claimed back then someone  s word was someone  s word or something   they said that people coming from different places in the world are ruining where they live   and that the people that were born in the areas are the ones that are honest or something   they also threatened to not pay the internet bill    which the entire household uses    just because said person was not paying attention to them while arguing   they said that they are trying to make things peaceful as a person is on their deathbed in the household   and make things calm for their last days   yet they yell at said person on their death bed and even tells them that they are going to die if they wo n t eat   and said that black folks do n t listen    dw they are black themselves    and that a white person would appreciate the efforts    the person on their death bed has dementia      they say to always love your parents and gave an example of how someone she knows was beaten so hard by her father that her skin turned blue and that she still loves and support her father    she is the cleanest person ever   and in a hotel the maids even said that they have never seen a person as clean as her i am starting to think no of them being an <type>   but maybe it is possible for them to be just unhealthy i think 
esfp,hello <type>s   in this interview   i got a chance to talk to jaclyn about what it  s like to be an <type> se te pc b    s    mm during the interview   jaclyn talked about her masculine se and gathering facts and combined with her kinesthetic sexual modalities   also like hitting a punching bag she also said that her double masculine st play makes her unable to say no at work even if she is already burdened with too many tasks and she just soldiers on and gets it done with her sf consume   she tends to be paranoid of hotels and checks to make sure everything is clean from coffee makers to bedsheets   pillowcases   etc jaclyn also talked about her feminine fi and how when she was young   she could tell she was n t like the other girls but despite that   she still felt very feminine inside regardless jaclyn also talked about her difficulties with ni and while she has some use of her nt blast   the nf sleep is a challenging area for sure watch this interview here 
intp,i wanna see how this goes   since i know our minds are sporadic as ever and although many of you will try to refine your posts   i urge you not to go over and over with extensive amounts of editing just post the little   random   complex   enlightening thought that you currently are holding in your head mine as      approaches i have realized that i am experiencing the onset of another decade of human life passing me by i have made it    years on this planet   gone through so many different friendships and scenarios of drama that have shaped me into quite the interesting person i am today i have experienced heart break   death   depression   enlightenment   revelation   and a change in spiritual belief my constant search for inner and outer knowledge has not changed yet the path to obtain this has wavered and been manipulated in a multitude of ways through my life i am wondering if my interest in a career in astronomy will stay true as college approaches or will my newfound love for chemistry take over    or will one of the random inspirational hobbies that pop up in my life become my future path    
isfp,<type> here trying to understand fi   so i thought i d ask the fi doms directly how do you experience your fi    i thought i d share my experience with ti to help   my ti just comes to me   if i m looking at the problem by observing or tinkering the observation is working out the problem logically in the background   unbeknownst even to me then all of a sudden i get a idea   an answer out of no where sometimes one answer   sometimes many   then consciously i pick which answer is the most likely to work and try that if it doesn t work   through trying that idea i ve pulled in more information so i get more accurate ideas and try those till something works but ti feels truly like a light bulb someone just flipped on so how do you experience your fi

intj,i m new here and i just read this somewhere clothing there  s generally two lines of clothing <type>s follow one   mentioned on the <type> fashion thread is largely utilitarian black    or dark    t shirt   jeans or cargo pants for females minimal jewelry few advertisements i follow this trend to the letter the few i know in reality wear light colored clothing   but essentially the same thing every day this light clothing is still cold colors    blue    whatever the case   clothing stays consistent and avoids drawing attention i actually laughed that  s like the opposite of what i wear what do you guys wear    
infj,i don t really know how to cope the world seems so dark currently i am trying to see the world in a good light but to do so   i always have to walk an extra mile it s not my standard mode to see things in a good way because there is a body you have to take care of there is illness in the world and flesh there are adorable puppies who have to die soon i don t like to think of the cold even animals enjoy to bath in the sun with a comforted look in their faces and still struggle in the freezing months i wish the world was soaked in lightness someone somewhere dies yet again i just struggle to integrate those dark things into a full circle of good world view it s just too much i know   being human means having to come to terms with this i have to accept that i am what i am a biological being i feel like a soul that has woken up under the wrong circumstances   in a hard body and world it has its needs and it is somewhat disruptive to nourish it maybe now there is a reason to like summer more 
entj,you guys might want to check out this post i made to <type> forum i got pretty controversial outcome from these answers i d appreciate also your opinion on this original matter seems like   i got some good info from our introverted colleagues   but also my fair share of well earned criticism quoting myself   something i really love this is especially for you <type> females i hope you can give me your opinion in an abjective manner   without taking a side of neither of us i have female <type> co worker   that i had this romantic relationship for few months today we are friends or something   i m actually not sure about what is the status of two of us the relationship we had started really sparkling and we soon became lovers after getting really know each other actually we had been working together at same company for few years before our patches crossed before i get to know her   i actually hated her i really dig this girl   or you could almost say that i m    still    in love with her it seems pretty hard for me to know how i should react to her because of her kind of introverted and bit of obscure nature in te fi we have pretty similar ideas about lots of things and the conversations are fenomenal still for some reason it seems that it is pretty easy for us to get into argument   because we both really stand out with our own opinions and statements we both are orally very talented and we are both used to rule the conversations and winning the battles the reason why it seems that i have trouble of understanding her is that i see how much her inner values and intuitive introversion defects on her opinions it seems that her opinions are based on inner values and intuitions and the facts    te    are selected on a base on what suits her best for that she seems bit subjective at all times this gets me on my toes   because i really value the facts    te    and form my opinions and the big picture    ni    based on them and valuing objective opinions really high we often seem to get on the same conclusions through different kind of paradigm we do n t have absolutely any problem of understanding the wholeness   besause we both can see the big picture well it is just that one goes from ni    fi    te and the other from te    se    ni psycological evaluation when our romantic relationship started to go down hill   our debates become more aggressive and she started to blame me for a lots of things of course that is a logical thing to happen when two people are falling apart from relationship she really seemed to get inside of my head and made some pretty far going psycological conclusion about me i think we both value ourselves pretty high and do n t cope well with critisism when she started to blame me for making her feel bad and not appreciating her    which is not true    i tried to argue back and look the situation from more objective site that did n t go well and she blamed me for lack of self reflection that might be true   because as an <type>   i admit that for time to time i have some difficulties about my inner control she was really demanding and anything i tried to explain her did n t make any point i treid to rationalize how relationship was a compromise of two people and hoe both of us should try to understand each other dispite of that she always came to conclusion that i should change myself to became what she wants i think that is beacause on her introversion    fi    and lack of external feeling function that makes it hard for her to understand other people to be honest i have say that i may suffer from same thing the way she critisised me was pretty harsh and it actually made me to question myself and kind of crumbled my self confidence that is something that has never happened before i got really depressed ant it took few months for me to get my game back together obviuos feelings   still so introvert what comes to her   it was a kind of suprise to me   how unwilling she was talking about her feelings or thoughts   even when i saw that there were something that bothered her i m not blind when comes to sensing other peoples thoughs and way they behave ofcourse this is natural behaviour of introverted thinker   but because of her strong presence i was able to read her pretty well on that i tried to make her really open up for me   and i guess i did that pretty aggressive way and when i did n t get anything out of her   i kind of did what <type>  s do and tried to control or manipulate her that really was the end of everything and i managed to pissed her of i  ve come clean to her about that and apoligized for my stupid behaviour how does it go now    after we broke up   she was kind of hostile towards me i think that kind of intensive behaviour is normal for <type> when someone has got close enough to brake the introverted mask she still blames me for how i made her feel and despite of the fact   that i  ve been her really honest towards her about my own depressions   she still kind of tries to get some revenge on me i do n t think that is nessessarily her goal i actually see that as an somekind of defensive mechanism towards her own feelings we still spend time together especially at work and we use a lot of time to discussing about everything we have kind of agreement about friendship   but the way she acts is not how a friend would act actually is more of how    bad    girlfiend acts though she says that i no more mean nothing to her she still sticks her nose up to my things she also still seems to have really specific ideas about me and how i should behave towards her i mean this as a positive way for me it is pretty obvious that she still cares about me or at least has somekind of feelings i know her well enought to know that she would n t spend this much time to something without any meaning of course when i by a joke try to get her to confess her feelings   she denies it we have n t really had serious conversation i m not even sure would that work on curnt situation the thing i want to know is can you ladies relate to this and what is your opinion    i do n t know if i need any advices   because i m not even sure   what i m going to do about her and what i think of her click to expand 
entp,<type> here   first time so i m so sorry if i posted in the wrong sub forum    my boyfriend and i took the test together and it has explained so much about our differences and just the overall dynamics of our relationship that i m now rather terrified terrified mostly because as i delve more into the type    <type>      the less secure i am feeling    a need for <type>s to feel    do n t get me wrong i love who he is i love that he has this childlike demeanor at times when i m too serious he  s playful   all over the place really   goes off tangent in conversations that i  ve gotten used to   and he  s brilliant he has told me he loves me and that i m witty   smart and beautiful    which i guess is a plus for him especially      so deep and that i always keep him on his toes but then there are so so many articles about just how much and often the <type> male    and maybe even females    get bored i  d like to defend and say that it is not so much sheer boredom but the fact you guys love newness and adventure i mean my boyfriend ca n t sit still the pandemic was especially hard on us    more so because he likely felt constrained by the walls of his home    i tried my best to cook him meals and help him see the good in the mundane day to day    the best i could because even i went a bit kookoo during this pandemic    anyway   but there are so many articles written by <type> males who outright admit that they ca n t seem to commit   to settle down   to even begin to imagine life with only one person for the rest of it and i m here just like oh insert happy face with small tear rolling down i m not asking for marriage tomorrow or even within the next year i  d just like to know or have a sense that that  s what we are working towards    and maybe that  s the annoying need to have a plan <type> trait in me or maybe its just a sense of security       i feel like overall <type> <type> complement very well i might just need to strengthen my logical thinking and let go of some of my emotions he can maybe work on developing his emotions a little more since he does come off insensitive at times but i know he is not ill willed he tells me i m reading too much into all of it which i probably am can someone help me out of this rabbit hole    ps    i do n t know if it matters but just to paint a picture he  s a very busy investment banker and i m a    introverted    lawyer 
isfp,would a relationship between two <type>s work    why or why not    
infj,i had high hopes for an <type> <type> relationship possibility   however now i m deciding against it i m interested in knowing your thoughts pros countless   from my point of view at least   and some from the point of view of the <type> cons    from the <type>  s point of view    <type>s seem to be interested in <type>s   but they also easily get distracted and forget they were interested this seems to be because <type>s are easily swayed by everyone this is another reason why <type>s like them they listen to us but in the end <type>s only listen to <type>s because they listen to everyone who sounds convincing and this means anyone can sway them whichever way which means that there is no security for the <type> none at all and there never will be because it  s not our job to keep wasting our time trying to convince you to stay with us cons    from the <type> pov       fill in the blanks   i do n t really care    <type>s are great   but they do n t have what this other girl has or what that one has or what the other one has cons    from the <type> pov regarding type xxxx       fill in the blanks   i do n t really care    xxxxs are great   but they do n t have what this other girl has or what that one has or what the other one has i wonder how an <type> feels when they get doorslammed

esfj,hello <type>s   pb s    c    ff in this interview   maggie talked about being comfortable with gathering information from people and bugging people for help but having trouble with consuming new information for herself maggie also talked about wanting to be really competent as a result of her st sleep and her identity is tied to competence she said she wants to be a valuable and respected member of the tribe and being competent is how she perceives to be valued we also talked about her being an exxj exxp and sometimes   she has no filter and just blurt things out without thinking which causes chaos in the tribe maggie also discussed her nf play and how she always tries to gather what the tribe really cares about in her day job   she works as an economist and part of her job is to track what people care about so they can introduce programs that people will get behind it in the last part of the interview   we talked about her ti swing and she said that she  s not surprised when it happens because it  s built up over time and when she knows a person will not change their behaviour in a good way   she will set hard boundaries with that individual watch this interview here 
enfj, edited desperate <type> needs help understanding love of my life   <type> i am an <type> who has been in love with an <type> for almost twenty years and i still do n t have him i wonder if i  ve made every mistake that it  s possible for an <type> to make and i need help understanding what  s going on we grew up together and from childhood i felt a connection with him it was as if i understood the deepest part of him in a way that no one else did and when he looked at me   i felt he understood me   too in our teens   lightning struck our eyes would connect   the world would fade away   and it was just he and i in a crowded room i  ve never felt that with anyone else but i was too young to realize what it meant we never did anything about it   moved on   grew up   and i married someone else he dated other people but never married for several years   i did n t see him and yet   i never forgot him it was as if he were a part of me my soulmate i was happily married content but at night   sometimes i would dream about him i would go months without a thought of him and then i would have a dream and i would think of him for days usually i dreamed that i was searching for him but i could never find him or if i found him   he never saw me i came to believe that there was a connection between us that was unexplainable and i would just have to live with it i went on with my life and tried to bury his memory deep inside last year   my life changed i discovered my husband was cheating an intensely loyal <type>   i was devestated i mourned and grieved and started to rebuild my life six months ago   i saw my <type> again for the first time in all these years it was like magic   all over again we sat and talked and he opened himself up to me in a way that i am only just beginning to realize was pretty special he  s always been the life of the party   the funny guy   but i  ve always seen beneath that to the serious   deep   real man that he is i was blown away i fell even deeper in love   but for absolutely real this time call it the hopeless romantic <type> part of me   but if i  ve loved him this long and it  s only getting deeper   i ca n t imagine loving anyone else we began to text and email and carry on a long distance something we talked about deep stuff real stuff fun stuff not every day but enough that we stayed in each other  s lives for the next two months on a regular basis usually he initiated the online conversations we would sometimes chat for two hours without saying anything very meaningful or important we were just completely comfortable and natural with each other after two months   i began to feel that he was pulling back the <type> in me quickly retreated i became scared and i was already so deeply in love   i did n t know what to do to be fair   he was very busy typical <type>   he was never home on any given night but was always busy doing with his hands in about a dozen pies but i felt like he was rejecting me my intuition told me he was pulling back i wondered if it was too much   too fast i decided to leave him alone i was n t sure what was going on and began to feel that he was blowing hot and cold because he would still occasionlly seek me out online but he never called me on the phone or did anything that was overtly flirty i began to go back over his behavior toward me i was n t convinced he viewed me any differently than any of his other friends he had never given me any indication that he viewed me romantically the last time i had seen him   he continued to joke and laugh and treat me like everyone else and yet   there was a subtle difference when he was around me if i caught him unawares   came upon him when he was n t expecting me   his eyes gave him away there was an expression in them that caught at me   made me lose my breath like his soul looking into mine it killed me hooked me there were other things   too i had noticed that when we first met again   he refused to look into my eyes at all he would talk to me or rather at me   but would n t make eye contact if he did   it was a glancing blow it was so obvious that i had begun to wonder if maybe i was wrong and he was n t really an extrovert   but was really shy instead but that did n t add up with everyone else   he was completely natural and confident it was only with me that he was different and   when i thought about it   he had acted this way right before i married my husband years before and there was always   always this tension within me when he was around   as if i were hyper aware of him i intuitively felt like he felt it   too   but wondered if i was imagining it i also noticed that he never hugged me never   ever but he hugged everyone else in a friendly   affectionate way that seemed to be a part of his personality just not me i was n t included i had even started to wonder if there was something wrong with me that he did n t want to hug me over the next four months   our contact became less and less i became desperate and yet determined not to beg i wanted him to come to me   if he wanted me and yet   if he wanted me even a little   i would have been willing to beg i just wanted him but i did n t know how to get him or if he even wanted me at all i began to wonder if i had made a serious mistake by pulling back i had thought he was playing games but i began to wonder if maybe he just had n t thought i was interested i had guarded my heart closely because i was afraid he would n t want it what if he thought i did n t want his    if i were honest   i had to admit that i had carefully treated him like a friend when everything inside of me had been dying for him about a month and a half ago   i saw him again i was still deeply certain that he did n t love me   that i was destined to live my life desperately loving him and pretending that i did n t and so   i closed down my deepest emotions and pretended that i was perfectly calm and he was just a dear   treasured friend there were no lingering glances   no accidental touches but still he sought me out i told myself he was seeking out the entire group of friends but he sat next to me   often i felt torn   emotionally chaotic   absolutely certain one moment that he felt the same way for me and then just as certain the next that he did n t finally   he caught me alone in a quiet moment and started to ask the deep questions   the kind that we had once shared so freely but i could n t share it was awkward and painful and i was in love with him and wanted all of him and so i shared very little this time   when i left   he hugged me it was n t a friendly   arms around shoulders hug that he gives everyone else it was closer   intimate i was the one to pull away   certain still that he viewed me as a friend it was only later that i started to wonder he told me specifically to keep in touch with him i   trying to protect my heart   told him just as specifically that he could contact me if he wanted to he told me that he had n t seen me online lately and he seemed awkward   hesitant   unsure i did n t know what this meant i had felt that he did n t want to talk to me as much and so i had n t been as available to him online but he could have called me if he had wanted to he had my number but he never had i was n t sure that i bought his reason but the way he looked at me   it was almost as if he blamed me for our lack of communication i was confused and did n t know what to think that night   i took a chance and texted him about how much i had enjoyed seeing him he immediately texted back   asking if i was home i said no and he texted back that we would talk soon and that he was n t very busy over the next week i thought   ok   i  ve done my part   and i did n t reply and just waited i waited for a month out of the blue two weeks ago   he contacted me again   wanted to know how i was doing and told me a little bit about his busy life we chatted online for an hour and then i initiated the goodbye   told him i loved talking with him but had to go the truth is   i could have sat up all night talking to him and i do n t want to be that girl   i m so confused by him that i do n t know if he wants me or not my <type> intuition says yes   but my <type> need to protect myself says maybe not why is n t he being bolder if he truly wants me    is he just being nice to me because i m a friend who  s gone through a rough time    or is he an <type> who  s afraid of my rejection    i will tell you that my intuition says he  s in love with me but my logical brain keeps making me doubt because he  s never actually done anything that could be considered romantic should i take a chance    should i open up more and be more vulnerable with him or should i just continue to wait    thank you in advance for your advice 
intj,post about anything creative you made photos are fun to see      it  ll be interesting to see if anyone posts in this thread      idea shamelessly stolen from the <type> forum   btw some neat things going on there the pressure is on people      hr hr i love embroidery and textile crafts and crafts in general too here is some of my stuff    oh   and i made the babies wearing the home made hats too it  s actually much harder making babies than people claim    i present to you random crap      ca n t take creadit for the pottery   just the turtle paint job last photo of a career poster made for an scout exhibition trying to convince the kids that cheme is the way to go lol edit woups   had to remove forgot the company logo    
istp,i was listening to a podcast with joyce meng interviewing a group of <type> types there was a part of the segment that alluded to <type> types neglecting family   friends   etc and not being conscious of it i do that in droves   but i also do it when i leave let  s say a job i may have former co workers attempting to stay in touch   but with anything once i am gone   i leave that aspect of my life behind and do n t give it too much thought i think this may be related to extraverted sensing where the cognitive function is in the present   not in the past or too far in the future thoughts    
entp,hi all people it is about that the truth about mbti first post discussing intelligence and type if we 
istj,have you <type>s ever noticed that the aspects of your personality type that appear in memes are the same as in <type> memes    how can this be possible if the two types are opposites    
isfp,i am certain without a doubt i am an xsfp personality type but i am not sure if i am <type> or <type> i will describe myself and hobbies etc and maybe it can help create a more accurate picture of which type i lean more towards i understand they both use the same functions   just slightly different orders i am very passionate about music i am a songwriter and record music myself and it is by far my favorite way i express myself to the world songs can move me deep inside instantly and i can listen to a song on repeat over and over i know whether i like something right away i connect to the overall feel i tend to like moody indie folk pop type music but my taste is very eclectic i love nature and anything being surrounded in dramatic landscapes the forest   coastline   mountains   and open countryside bring me so much peace and happiness it s like i am totally rejuvenated after being in those environments i am highly affected by lighting and sensitive to changes in the immediate environment i am captivated by sunsets i love going for drives or riding my motorcycle something about it just grounds me and helps me feel relaxed and at ease in the world it also allows me to see new sights and take time to reflect which i love   i do enjoy people but i spend a significant time alone   not always by choice but by the nature of my lifestyle and job etc i am very independent by nature   and do most things alone something i have always enjoyed doing is people watching i love to analyze what is happening around me i am very passionate with my beliefs and values if i see someone either violating those   or not respecting mine   it is an instant turn off for me and i do not have any desire to create connection with that person any longer i am a huge advocate for treating others with kindness and compassion   and listening to others and validating their opinions and beliefs regardless if ours don t align that being said   i can be very outgoing and life of the party in some situations especially with close friends or family   but also very quiet and reflective too depending on the mood i am in when there is too much stimuli around me   i can get rather frazzled and overloaded i am sensitive to energy around me this is me in a nutshell   let me know what you think

enfp,i  ve read that the <type>s have more and better coping mechanisms than most i  d tend to agree with that assessment i have several   some of which i shall list here what are your coping mechanisms when life gets tough    what gets you stressed in the first place    my survival skills   a typical <type>   generally be optimistic against all evidence believe that things will improve   see even the smallest positive ray and cling to that for dear life and as the reason to believe that there  s a positive spin to the whole thing   keep doing things i believe in and are important to my value system surround myself with like minded people also have a few people who think otherwise to keep perspective   have deep friends who are honest to me about what i am and am not doing right   and who cheer me even when i am slipping friends who never abandon   no matter what i count <type>s   <type>s   <type>s and gasp   <type>s in this and yes   also <type>s in their oddly decoupled yet accepting way   take on projects like crazy even when i can hardly handle what  s already there   help people who have real problems in life   like a child with terminal illness it gives an important perspective of how much harder life could be and instantly makes me feel grateful for what i already have i feel privileged and thankful for the comforts and normality i have in my life   sing   dance   or go for long walks   learn something new in science it always picks me up   call a friend i  ve not called in some time and talk    call my parents    help my children out with something they need   or plan ahead for something i anticipate that they will soon need    play badminton    write a poem or some fiction    learn something hard like a new programming language or a hard mathematics concept    tidy all clothes wardrobes or do grocery shopping    engage in mbti or science or music or english grammar discussions online

esfj,i m genuinely wondering here so far sfjs have me stumped i try to explain everything in as clear and explicitly logical a manner as possible and i get nothing the sfj skirts around my argument and ignores it completely i realise i m going about it the wrong way   but if i lay it out clearly enough   surely the most basic logic must be understood    honestly   i m meant to be irritating you   not the other way around how do i go about communicating with an <type>    
infj,so there is a thread called <type> porn thought i  d start one here it seems to be just a thread of <type> stuff this of course means that this thread should hypothetically be filled w nothing but huggy face kissy bear stuff w the occasional love humanity hate people quandary kitteh

infp,hi i m bambi a female <type> and born in      something just happened which gave me a fright and is causing me to go into a spin a little emotionally and i was hoping to check if some one could help i found some one online by chance and without looking for him a little earlier in      and i think he could be an <type> because he could lead with fe a lot and we posted to each other about an objective area both care a lot about   and kind of clicked and over the months became close and although i could n t speak for him i felt emotionally intimiate and a lot of feelings including romantic ones and i ca n t fully describe it but i truly really really like and care about him a lot i found the person created a  nd hidden page they were sending nice messages on   sometimes in the early hours of the morning   and they followed me over to another guy friend  s page on the  nd hidden page   kind of to note they were watching me and almost like they were a little terrirotial and uncomfortable with me being close to another male   even though i had a clear conscience was n t trying to do anything crooked i think the <type> knew i really really liked them over time   more and more   although i noted there was always kind of a hidden key i did n t know which looked as though it was holding them back   and i thought he could of been a little afraid but i just learned he is married as he noted in a post a little earlier today a sentence about  my wife in       i feel  st and foremost so bad and wrong inside for interfering with a married couple by accident and for trespassing against the <type>  s wife by accident who i did n t know was married to him i cried a lot falling asleep and today and feel a little freaked out and in shock and a little afraid of the <type> because i truly cared about him a lot and trusted in how our relationship was kind of unfolding and trusted all of the feelings i had for him could any one have any notes or ideas who could n t know us and maybe be outside of the situation about how i could be brave enough to come away     and not be in touch with the <type> who is married   to help protect his wife i truly feel so bad and all mixed up inside and ty for carefully reading and hope it could be better soon a note it  s possible i could n t have all of the information the <type> could know   and he mentioned his home was being sold and he was living with his dad a couple of months ago and was going through some things   and it could be he may of separated with his wife   although they are still legally married and maybe he had n t noted it before because he was separated   although i do n t know and am to afraid to say or do anything and feel like i cannot talk to him again because he has a wife and it feels unethical and i feel so wrong for tresspassing

estp,i was thinking about how my oldest daughter grad party is around the corner   and is being hosted at her dads lets just say there will be some haters there i told my oldest daughter that ultimately it was to celebrate her so that is what counts but i told her i will feel sorta like a lone ranger in many aspects while yes my family will be there etc too my family is not all up in my shit like her dad and his family and my friends of course will come yes my daughter told me i needed to spell out to my two best friends that they needed to be on stand by and get sitter and actually be present not simply attend she scolded me and said that people think i do not need support sometimes because of how i present myself i think i do not want to get let down i told one of my friends i would like her to actually come be my wing woman for the day fully attentive i think it will really hurt me if she is distracted with all her drama 
enfj,my <type> girlfriend of   years broke up with me this past week and she never told me a direct answer why    we had a lot of very small problems that do n t seem very big      but we did have a conversation again about those said problems but in a different manner   i think she wanted to break up with me then aswell but when i told her i loved her more the anything and that i am willing to change and i will get on with my schoolwork and get a job    i am in college and im trying to move into her city where she goes to college aswell and where i will got to college next year and i want to make some extra money      months later she breaks up with me anyway with again all small problems and never telling me what the issue actualy was i was sure i was doing everything correct and i as an <type> wanted to apologize as soon as possible thinking that she will close me out forever if i do n t do it quickly i ended up pushing her into a corner and she almost said she wanted to correct things but then out of a sudden changed her mind again   minutes later after that conversation   days have passed which i have spent going through our entire relationship and examining what the issue was and i realized that she was giving me all this attention and when i was too focused on fixing the issue i had with me not having a job to make some money i neglected her a lot and i realized all the pain i caused to her by doing that i had some childhood trauma and it was hard for me to show my emotions because of my insecurities and i was getting over them but very slowly thinking it should n t be a priority i always showed her a lot of emotion when we were together alone and when we were together every single day   but when college starts then we  re away and do n t see each other for   days we do n t text a lot because we both would rather talk face to face and i felt very bad for not doing that for some time that  s why i was focused on moving there as soon as possible so we could see each other every day i realized she broke up with me because of the neglect because i am a very emotional person and when i talked to my friends about the breakup i told them all of my issues out in the open    which i always hid    and i kept telling everyone how much i loved her and that i could n t live without her and that she is the girl of my dreams then yesterday i noticed what an idiot i was i kept telling everyone else what a wonderful person and a great lover my girlfriend is and i never said it enough to herself i know her to my core and i always knew when she was upset and it always broke my heart but she never showed that she was upset when she would be upset because of me and that  s why i never read her correctly then now i feel apsolutely miserable and i miss talking to her and telling to her how much i love her i wish i could just make this realization   weeks ago i have so much love for her and all i want to do is tell her every day of how sorry i was and i want to tell her every day how much i love and cherish her and everything she does for me and everyone around her i know she knows i love her very much and i know she loves me very much i want to show her that i  ve changed and i want to apologize to her but i know that i backed her up in a corner because of my own stupidity and i am afraid to talk to her again because i do n t want her to see me pushing her into something she is n t ready for but at the same time if i wait too long i am afraid that she will close herself to me and that i will lose her forever i know there is a party coming up where she and i will definetly be there    we share the same friend circle    and i want to tell her and show her how much i changed and how much i love her and how i am sorry that i misunderstood her and that she should n t doubt herself with anything and that i wish i could tell her i love her and hug her every day i m friends with the big party host and i want to surprise her by singing to her infront of everybody with the song from one of her favorite movies    things i hate about you    i am very shy when it comes to my singing and barely sang to her when we were alone    but that is very risky because i am scared that if i scare her off then then i know my window is closed 
esfp,hello <type>s   in this interview   i got a chance to talk to erin about what it  s like to be an <type> se te pb s    c    ff erin is the rare consume last exxp and it  s clear to have some benefits and disadvantages as a result the advantage would be that she is a production and teaching machine which helps her career the downside is that she becomes disconnected from her emotions and while she can execute   she might be working on the wrong field or wrong life direction this proved to be the case as we discussed her divorce   lack of planning   and self neglect as a result of not using her fi and her ni more often the conclusion we came up with was still positive as erin   at the very least   is aware of her problems and knows where to start to troubleshoot and figure out how to be better in touch with her emotions and focus more on her inner world so she can do things in life that brings her joy instead of unhappiness watch this interview here

isfp,it was a good idea   and i had to copy it wink my style   well recently has changed over the years i must say   i guess it is only because i have had money of my own   and i m starting to look at fashion differently i used to wear a pair of jeans everyday and a polo shirt   or just a plain t shirt   and felt pretty comfy it was better than those sweats and t shirts i wore when i was younger i ca n t believe i wore sweats outside i dress for comfort   but it has to be fashionable   i do n t think i really express myself through my clothing choices   yet i could be wrong i m in love with floral prints   knitted dresses   lace   and pretty much clothes that are the colour purple i wear jeggings   and jeans a lot though i m pretty chic i guess it  s best with a picture i from polyvore of course i could n t afford all of this   but this is a sample of what i would wear

esfp,i was called a snob today and i was rather taken aback by it how can someone as pragmatic   terrestrial   humble and approachable as myself be declared a snob in front of my peers    i denied the accusation instantly   this person is clearly an imbecile maybe the imbecile is misinterpreting my extreme intelligence   witticism   majestic high mindedness for snobbishness perhaps the imbecile is so mired in his own marshy soot to see that i am not a snob   but that he is the prole who is envious   why should someone as gifted and inspirational as myself sink to the level of these proles so that i may be deemed a humble idiot like the rest    he is everything wrong with society today   the conformity to blind complaisance   the masses sinking into the lowest expectations   total mass stupidity 
enfp,i think it s what we are interested in care to comment    
intj,of course   an <type> can be alone and not feel bad or lonely in fact   sometimes a lot can be accomplished by oneself and   sometimes    solitude is an <type>  s friend but what does an <type> do when feeling lonely       can an <type> feel overwhelmingly alone       or is it just the way we are built some part of us is always lonely             you          
esfj,have any <type> females dated an <type> i ask because <type>s are one of my preferred personalities to have a relationship with as far as i know i ve never dated one   it s not like i have everyone i go out with take a mbti test i m a pretty healthy <type> male by the way just curious how the relationship was 
isfp,i m an <type> girl and recently i have a crush on an <type> boy we are in the same class and to me   we act like bf and gf   only we never proposed i only got close to him since the start of      we spent almost every recess and lunch together   and we enjoy each others  presence he comes to my seat pretty often in the mornings before classes start    he used to start sleeping from the instance he gets to his seat    and i go to him every recess at first   we just seemed like normal school friends   chatting and making fun of each other   but somehow i grew to stick with him and making physical touches like touching his hair or his face at first   he stared at me and told me not to do it but now   i can touch him everytime i want also   he seems to be flirting with me as he never stays half as close with any other girls he even kneeled down by my side and put his head on my desk once       and he helped me cool down once in a school outing by putting his iced coffee on my face    obviously not to shock me but to help me cool down    and when i lent him his fan   he adjusted the angle by moving my hand directly when he refused to stand and continued walking   i gave him my hand and he took it and got up also   we stuck together throughout the day and even when i moved to the front   he followed i m not very good at reading people  s mind but i guess he at least has some interest or feelings for me    i proposed to him but got rejected as he said he could n t get into an intimate relationship right now   but we still stick together every day after this can i believe that he likes me as well    and should i wait for him to reciprocate    many thanks 
istp,let me explain this   firstly romantic orientation and sexual orientation is not the same thing i  ve noticed this in some bisexuals actually for example   a bisexual is attracted to two genders but he only sees himself settling down with a woman this would mean he is a heteroromantic bisexual for most people   the romantic orientation does match the sexual orientation perhaps it is a female who is a heteroromantic heterosexual or a male homoromantic homoesexual but it is possible to have all sorts of combinations along with orientations that prefer certain genders or sexes   there are orientations that do not form attractions these are denoted by the a prefix   as in atheist asexual is an orientation where the person is not attracted sexually aromantic is an orientation where the person is not attracted romantically keep in mind that behavior is different from orientation a person may be homosexual but has sex with people of the opposite gender in the same way   an asexual may have sex with a person so i was wondering if there are any asexuals   aromantics   or people who have different romantic orientations than what their sexual orientation is that visit this website or even if you suspect that you may be one and what your personal experiences are personally   i am an aromantic heterosexual feel free to ask questions 
estj,hello <type>s   in this interview   i got a chance to talk to daniel about what it  s like to be an <type> jumper te ne pc s    b    ff first   daniel talked about loving his fi and doing fi all day long however   if the tribe comes around and asks for help   he said he feels responsible to help them because his play is nt   he likes to solve problems with the tribe in a collaborative way because he has trouble using his st blast   he rather show the tribe how to do something than teach them or tell them how to do something daniel being nt play is also very prominent as he told me several clever nt jokes for example   he said when someone says something to him hurtful   he will pretend it did n t hurt him but in reality   it  s like him being a grass pokemon weak to a fire pokemon their attacks    words    would be super effective on him he also talks about being energy dominant and being balanced with his energy levels because he is an exxj exxp   he does get bored of routines quickly and wants to channel change making sticking to a workout or diet difficult for him daniel also talked about his fear of judgement as an exxj and how making friends was something that was tough when he was younger because he was picky with people but was also grateful when he was older when another tribe adopted him to join their group watch this interview here

esfp,first of all   if you  re about to post you  re a typist   go away   it wo n t help anybody observations i see <type>s as pot smoking guys who do n t care about anything but their friends and themselves in their   s   they may start to care about things like corporations and the government or other righteous things they love to party   preferably with their friends   a close group of friends or their friends   but do n t mind strangers partying sometimes includes other drugs rather than weed   combined with lots and lots of alcohol likely to be smokers as they wanted to be cool generous   would share a chocolate that costs    kg that he just got from his grandma overseas with a friend  s friend just because he  s there with him at that moment ca n t be trusted to do something they promise   likely to just forget it may even skip a class because they forgot about it   or a driving lesson   even if it costs     to retake it and they do n t have it do n t know if the following is country specific   but do n t like to work   unless it  s illegal and relatively easy very impulsive   prefer to set schedule    minutes before it happens   an hour tops oddly   when young seem to want some kind of fame   but that may be mistaken for the wish to be accepted due to their social skills and rather charming personality   some may consider them a leader   assuming it  s a group of friends always have a story to tell   whether their own or someone else  s often it  s someone else  s though pay attention to the stories of others   if it  s happened to someone else   it  s the truth sort people into respected and disrespected   depending on how their interests match have a moral code   once an <type> even gave back what he stole from a guy in an online game because he felt bad about it loves animals   may stop and pet a stray dog or a cat on the street do n t mind stuff that may harm them   life is short   live good   die young kinda folks do n t mind getting lost in thought when doing something   so concentration skills when under stress may be violent or do immoral stuff   like stealing from the less respected friends or insulting them do n t mind making fun of friends or others as long as it  s between friends neglect any logical discussion unless it  s one on one a partner leaving them may cause great stress that can last even for a month or a bit more and may lead into more than usual drug abuse do n t like talking about love or romance   especially if it  s related to them may annoy the hell out of an <type> by asking countless why    questions about stuff that i see as intuitive and if i take the time to explain it   may just stick a too serious sticker on it great activity partners gaming   whether computer or real world and sports i bet that part of the observations are either generalizations or unrelated   so feel free to comment or post your observations and discuss 
istj,so i am a   m <type> chemist i fit most of the textbook descriptions of an <type> except i am not as organized and detail oriented as i would like to be   not really as stubborn   in romance i really need to warm up to someone first though some of the descriptions read like by the   th date i finally made a move and touched her hand hopefully kiss by the   th i am primarily relying on old i do n t go to many places where i meet women in real life i a pursuing women my age       without kids    do n t have do n t want    my dating history is nearly nonexistent i am not particularly sensitive to women  s attractiveness and most women are sufficiently attractive to me it is n t my primary criteria i think a biggest problem i am encountering is i just do n t know how to tease   banter   and flirt i have conversations ask questions   listen but in the end i often get told no chemistry my default state is kind of mr spock any tips    i have watched a lot of youtube videos and am envious of the natural charm those guys are able to exhibit but do n t feel i can do it effectively and genuinely 
estp,i know that in my experience   the <type>s i am close with are always scanning people around them especially making remarks about appearances it might be insensitive and triggering for some but i do find it comical and i would always giggle since you guys especially the males would always find anyone  s weaknesses    anything that has to do with appearance especially    including to me lol although i do feel stunned when the one i used to even went out with called me ugly as a joke or what i wear was ugly or said smugly with his mouth twitched slightly while holding my sleeve   you missed a spot there this is dirty   not clean i do find it a bit blunt of him to say that during that time but it made me push my limit and made me aware of myself even better than before there was one time when the <type> called my dear friend   too skinny which she took it to the heart and i did n t like it that he said such a thing and mentioned about her body since she  s insecure herself if the <type> knew i was chubby a few years ago   he would have probably called me pillow or a cow or something along the lines which might have triggered me a bit and lead me to passive aggressive behaviours and an eating disorder but well   now i do find it a way for me to improve and i love how the <type> says it as it is which makes them one of the misunderstood types as well i do wonder if any other <type>s especially the males do this    
infp,how do you as <type> present to the outside world    do you look normal are you cold and serious or warm and friendly    how do you think others see you    not sure what i am really asking   so feel free to answer as you wish i have watched several <type> videos and have casually known a handful of professed <type>s in my life   and it seems like all of them present far more artsy than me like   they seem more like a softer animal loving and poetry vibing style if i didn t relate so much to the description of <type>   in just a comparison of what i have witnessed in them   i d say i am absolutely nothing like that in presentation   except maybe the looking up at the air when i talk maybe i am just a more shallow <type> but   i feel like i look normal   even though i know i am not lol maybe i am also wondering how much of my <type> i have beaten out of myself   so that i can appear normal to everyone to glide on by and avoid judgment it seems like maybe other <type> do not do that and are more authentic in presentation also just some wonderings

esfp,hello everyone   in this interview   i got a chance to talk to all the exxp types about their differences and similarities during the discussion   we discussed what causes exxps to feel anxious and how that feeling manifests in their bodies we also talked about the exxp  s ixxj swing and what that looks like for each individual exxp type it turns out that exxps also do n t like chaos and like to control things in their life the only difference is when chaos happens or plans get ruined   the exxps can easily pivot to other plans or feel calm when chaos hits next   the exxps discuss their issues with over gathering and what that looks like based on their type this part of the discussion was interesting because each type tends to over gather something completely different ranging from physical objects to information to values we also touched on double observing or the lack of teaching doing after consuming new information this leads us talking to the differences between info dominant and energy dominant exxps we then touched on people problems as an exxp and what that looks like and finally   we discussed ti being annoyed at ti and fi being annoyed at fe and even fe being annoyed at fe panel members were jany    <type> se te pb c    s    ff      tiana    <type> se fi cs p    b    ff      shane    <type> se ti cp b    s    mm      ian    <type> se fe pc s    b    ff      jacob    <type> ne fe pc s    b    ff      jake    <type> ne ti cp s    b    mm      annie    <type> ne fi cs b    p    mf      ashli    <type> ne te pc b    s    fm    for the first hour and me    <type> ne te pb c    s    mf    for the second hour watch this interview here

esfj,i want to confess to this <type>   but i have doubts ok so it  s been   months that we  ve known each other so i m running a small cafe and she is my current and only barista    the rest of employees are my family members    she  s    and i am      she still go to college she wanted to get a part time job so here we are i made her took a personality test during the interview at first   we were pretty professional but now   i feel like everyday is a date with her lol it has been like this after we spent the first   weeks i found so many signs that she  s interested with me more than a friend   here are some strong examples she  s blushing everytime we stare at each other you know   that awkward smile as we both could n t contain it any longer lol when we  re across the room   i often found that she  s staring or at least paying attention to me and just me her face is light up everytime i enter the room and smile she teases me a lot like a lot in a very playful way and sometimes act very silly around me    like   she  s pretending to faint then literally fall on the floor   she  s jumping around like a rabbit as she said goodbye   etc    she leans in and gets closer to me whenever we have conversations   sometimes our body touch she also sometimes slap my shoulder or arms whenever she gets excited when there  s no customers   she always ask me to have fun together   like watching movies together or playing games    hago    together and when we do this   we sit really close sometimes our thighs touch she always try to keep the conversation going   even sometimes when i m busy with my laptop   she keeps bothering me   curious abt what i m working on   trying to get my attention in general i think she does n t like it when i m ignoring her everytime she buy or cook food   she either buy it for me too or share her food with me    if she  s lacking money    compliments    oh cmon   i received this a lot from her sounds perfect right    not until   later on   i found out that she has a boyfriend thanks to my detective capabilities cough cough well   secret boyfriend   to be specific so   she never mentioned him at all   even i later realized he ever came to my cafe once   but she only introduced him to me as his friend wow she also hides him from public   i think only her very close relatives know the truth about them there are so many strange things about their relationship though none of them ever post and brag about them being together on social media publicly and   compared to her previous bf   this one is totally different   previous one was handsome good looking guy while this one is like the total opposite i am not being racist just spitting fax okayy i can only assume   is he her rebound or something    did she get traumatized because handsome guy could ditch her anytime    but she has been with this guy for almost a year is rebound even that long    i do n t think zo ok   so   damn i m so confused man i have made sure that she does n t treat her other male friends like how she treats me even   she does n t play hago with his boyfriend   but only with me   and this few facts below only confuse me even more she has made up her mind to make my cafe as her thesis project   and she also want to have an official internship in my cafe so she planned at least   year ahead involving me in her life she also try to find ways to meet with me outside of working hours    she asks my help for her homeworks   teach several subjects   etc    she even pleaded to me not to leave her for my other job    so i m currently looking for a job and have considered to take some time off from my cafe for some period of time    so what she did    she asked me to give her my cv   then she keeps sending me job recommendations nearby so i wo n t be far and still around   since i ever told her i wanted to get a job in foreign countries she also hates it everytime i have to leave from my cafe for some business reasons   she always show disappointment in her faces and tell me please be quick and come back ok last but not least   she has asked us to take selfies together and she wanted to upload them on social media   but i refused the first time this happened   it happened during our first week lol though we ended up taking selfies and share to each other only lol idk   maybe because i refused to share them publicly so she thought that i do n t have feelings for her ey    i also ever told her that i do n t want people to get the wrong idea about us   i m worried it would give negative effects to my cafe since i m the owner but still   she already has boyfriend why would she even want to do that with me    she hides her boyfriend but wanted to show me off to the world   wait did i hear that wrong       oh   i almost forgot one night she  s about to buy herself a new eye glasses and asked my opinions as she browsed the marketplaces    we were together sitting on a sofa in my cafe    and she ended up buying with the one i recommended wait why did n t she ask for her bf opinion instead    i also know that her relationship with her boyfriend is just alright   despite it  s an ldr so i do n t think she  s trying to make her boyfriend jealous ok   i originally wanted to confess but i have doubts since i found out about her secret boyfriend should i confess   or wait for her to make the first move    i always feel an amazing spark everytime we  re around    idk whether she feels it too or does n t    but what i m truly sure about is   we  re always having fun whenever we are together   no matter what we do   time just flies everyday feels like an adventure one day   there  s a national holiday so i gave her   weeks off you know what happened    she only took   week and came back to work without my knowing   i asked her why and she said staying in home was very boring and i wanted to surprise you oh   one more thing   we are asians so please consider that sex is pretty much taboo here and how it affects the culture of how we show and display love in general    not as casual and straightforward as the western  s    ca n t wait to hear your opinions   my fellow cyber friends
esfj,you always hear about notorious criminals in other types but rarely often how they come or look when they are of types with a kinder image stereotype i was just curious about your thoughts on ghislaine   if you are familiar with her if not familiar   i was watching this when i looked it up apparently jeffrey epstein was an <type> and ghislaine   his partner in crime an was <type> both were  w  
infj,feel free to share your own misconceptions the <type> stare is not blank i know this image is just a meme   there might be ni in this stare   but it lacks fe it is not an <type> stare this image is not an <type> stare either there might be fe in that stare   but it lacks ni <type> stares are a combination of ni and fe ni gives the stare it  s soul searching look   and fe gives the stare it  s hint of warmth and empathy it  s this rare combination that makes <type> stares stand out if a stare does not have both of these   then it is not an <type> stare i think the reason why people find this stare so startling is more then just it  s rarity the ni fe combo is like a one two punch most people are either use to someone  s face being sad   or trying to read them   etc one thing at a time but with an <type> stare   we are simultaneously reading them with ni and absorbing and feeling their emotions with fe it can come off as very intrusive it  s like we opened a gateway into their mind and they had no say about it that  s why people feel uncomfortable with these types of stares from strangers people in relationships with <type>s say they like these stares   but its a totally different deal with a stranger 
infp,hello <type>s and <type> forum i have some <type>s that i dearly love in my life   but a few of my friends and myself have been severely hurt by <type>s in non platonic ways i have identified a pattern of romantic destruction    yes i am an sj    that these <type>s have committed in each instance to hurt me or my non <type> friends here they are stating that they want one thing    ex playing the friend card   the casual sex card    but really secretly wanting another ex secretly seeking a serious monogamous relationship   then being disappointed with their partner for not doing it   even though they did not ask for it   and did not clearly state their wants or needs saying they never loved or felt anything for a partner   but only at the end when everything is all over when the <type> says this   it usually causes their partner to further distance or to end things the <type> usually denies romantic involvement when the relationship hits a certain pass fail point that requires good communication skills   not passivity or denial why would anyone want to continue a relationship with someone who felt nothing for them    seriously wtf      for example   one <type> started referring to us as true love   and would always bring us up in the context of true love we got together all the time   like every other day we had been emotionally close for years anyway however   six months later   at the end of things   i asked him if he ever felt anything for us and he denied it   saying his interest in me was only in a fascinated way   and never in a romantic way which one is the truth    what he said at the end   or what he said six months before the end    setting secret traps or hoops for the romantic partner to jump through if the partner foibles    like all human beings do      or if the partner does not somehow read minds or magically infer how they are supposed to respond to each secret trap   the <type> is disappointed   many times going completely emo yet the <type> does this all as an unspoken agenda   so that nearly every potential romantic partner fails it is like a secretive confirmation bias when the <type> starts looking for something to be wrong with their romantic partner that is not really there   they will end up making it happen confirmation bias is a law that you will find what you look for if you look for red   or the letter a while driving down a highway   you will find it same thing with romance if you start looking for things to be wrong   or focusing on them   you will make mountains of mole hills then after that the <type> can begin to blow off the potential romantic partner as worthless   or as non relationship material one example at the height of the classic pass fail point    that every relationship either makes it or breaks it here    the <type> tells me he will never have a relationship again   that it is too painful so i follow his word as clear   literal   concrete truth   that he is not into me   etc etc then when i tell him i am dating others and begin treating him as a friend   he decides to silent treat me he then states he will be less and less available in the future and that is not apologizing for it he then states we never had a relationship   yet at the same time   he treats it exactly like a relationship break up   rather than a friendship when said <type> says we never had a relationship   i take it as the clear truth   so i treat him as a friend yet when i do this   he gets disappointed in me my friends and myself have considered swearing off dating <type>s forever we do not know of one who has had a lasting successful relationship my friends began making bad <type> jokes about losing wallets   thinking weapons are flashlights   needing <type> enemas for all the shit they read wrongly into other  s actions   etc so   why would an <type> say one thing   then turn around and say another    why would an <type> stop seeing other people and commit to a partner because it would be wrong not to then later down the road   tell that person you never meant anything to me i never felt anything i can tell you as a sensor   if i love someone   i love them end of story if they hurt me   they hurt me if there was something between us   then there was and always will be   even if it did not last i would never wait until the end and say i never loved so and so to me   that seems extremely emotionally sadistic do <type>s pretend to feel    do they pretend to love someone    is this why they deny ever loving someone at the end    
entp,hello again visionaries which philosophies do you think are overrated    i think philosophies that might be linked with tight competition can be overrated life may be a race   but i see certain aspects of life as an individual journey rather than a race if that makes sense note overrated simply means overestimated it does not mean overrated equals unimportant 
esfj,hello <type>s i do n t ordinarily hang out in your forum and i understand if some of you do n t want to be interrogated by a curious <type> however   if it would be of interest to any of you i am curious have any of you mistyped as an <type>    have you ever read the descriptions of an <type> and thought man that really sounds like me 
isfj,hello <type>s   in this interview   i got a chance to talk to mingdi about what it  s like to be an <type> si ti sc p    b    ff <type>s are rare in the personality community so it  s nice to hear from mingdi on how he experiences life as one we first talked about how obvious he was lead st and how robotic he comes across he then talked about his nt consume and how he gathers a lot of information to figure out a solution for his problems mingdi also talked about journaling to make his feminine si solid otherwise   it makes it difficult for his ti to make a concrete conclusion or decision we also talked about his nf play and how mingdi is interested to see what people are up to and why they made those decisions he also talked about his double feminine sf blast and how he rarely uses it and getting started is extremely difficult for him we also talked about him having tester sexual modalities and he always wants to try different food and restaurants watch this interview here 
esfp,so i  ve been doing a lot of research and have come to the conclusion that i am either an <type> or an <type> i just got done reading the thread you know your an <type> when but when i came over here nothing   soooo let  s start one   happy this way   i can compare more easily and it will be fun   tongue 
infj,if we get enough votes   i was hoping to get this thread stickied so <type>s can use it as a medium to vent and have quick access to it   instead of making individual threads anyways   if you  re having a bad day or just want to yell to the four winds issues that have been frustrating you lately   this is the thread to do so of course   if you have specific issues that you would like our wise members of this board to help you out with   you  re welcome to make your own thread for it begin 
entp,i m an <type> woman and sometimes   it can be a little frustrating when women end up disliking me because of my personality my male friends have told me that they find me intimidating   but it has never been an issue with any of them in fact   i jive better with guys than with other women because the former seem to love a challenge from me while the females seem to hate my guts    my boyfriend is an <type> and we get along fine it  s great that he understands that i prefer hanging out with my guy friends every once in a while    i  ve actually been consciously supressing my <type> side when i m with my female friends   but it  s exhausting trying to be all nice and sweet when i m with them i actively keep myself in check when i open my mouth   but it does n t seem to be enough for them so far   only a handful of female friends actually get me    and know i do n t mean any harm when i start talking      while most    close and mere acquaintances    just think i m a jerk    sorry   i m ranting here i just recently decided to cut ties with a group of friends i hung out with for the last   years because of their close mindedness and clique ishness    but really   i genuinely want to know what other <type> women experience with other non <type> women   and how they deal with it 
entj,hey i happen to be a big horror fan i was wondering out of these horror franchises which do you prefer and why    mainly want to see if there  s any pattern amongst ntj  s on which one

intj,i just typed <type> woman feelings into google   and nothing came up   crazy okay   so it did once i pressed the enter key but anyway   after i stopped laughing it got me to thinking what makes you really laugh   <type>s    stories   pictures   videos   whatever tickles your funny bone post it here   
entj,this is the line of my favorite <type> character from overwatch doomfist doomfist seeks to start a war between the machine and humanity   just because of the first war with the omnics he makes the point that the first war updgraded humanity because of natural selection and want to make humanity evolve once more even if the situation is a little too extreme here do you think the line is true though    or do you think it is a simplification of what <type>s are    
esfj,hello <type>s   in this part   of the group interview with all types that have extroverted feeling   introverted thinking   extroverted intuition   and introverted sensing in their function stack   we discussed how each type use nt    ne ti    consume rose    <type>      isaac    <type>      julie    <type>      emily    <type>      and andreas    <type>    talked about how they each individually use sf blast during this final part of this interview   isaac talked about sf blast being a double edged sword yes   you can get people to behave better and he talked about shushing people who were n t paying attention to the teacher when he was younger at the same time   the sf part of sf blast made isaac aware that it  s not cool to be shushing people so he made sure to respect the sf part later on rose used to make rude chaotic t shirts when she was younger which was very sf cool andreas does the whole rapping thing and he  s also the biggest blaster in this group probably because he is saviour di and is not as hesitant to blast even though isaac and rose have double activated blast emily uses sf blast to troll people and julie uses sf blast to be the controller in her family since her husband is even more chaotic than her watch this group interview here

istp,hello   i recently joined the site and have been really impressed with the level of insight shared on this forum i was hoping someone could help me with a <type> i just met my employer recently hired a new college graduate       years old    to fill a vacancy and subsequently my boss asked me to train i am a    year old male <type> and after getting to know him over the past month of training i am confident he is a <type> we share similar hobbies and interests and just two days ago he invited me along to one of his hiking expiditions i was really on the fence about how well he liked me as he is hard to read since the invite   he and i both have begun to share a lot more detail about our daily lives something he for any other person gives a typical <type> generic answer if asked what brings me here looking for an answer revolves around how this particular <type> stares at me for the past week   as i pass by him   i catch him out of the corner of my eye staring at me only me he does not do this towards others and has little interest in how others in the room are behaving yet   it is like he watches my every move with his head tilted just enough to see me so he could turn quickly if needed he is a bit immature still and thinks he is being slick when he does this when i naturally turn in his direction   he quickly adjusts his head like he had no idea i was there and his facial expression is really weird when he does this with his mouth slightly open interestingly as of late   he has started to not pull away and we lock eyes face to face admittedly   i too stare at times at people i am trying to size up however   how this <type> stares is unlike anything i have ever encountered as my feeling trait tells me his overall body language does not correlate like he is trying to read me then today   i again noticed through a reflection on a piece of glass he was staring at me a few moments later he mumbled and asked me over to his work station for some help we work in a lab and he needed to transfer some acid he asked if i would do it mind you   he has far more academic experience at this than i do the task at hand did not at all need two people but i happily obliged in fact   he had done a similiar task earlier today without me while i was in the pouring process   he then proceeded to place his hand on the glass container to pour the solution with me i do n t like to be touchy at all with someone unless i know them and this really made me uncomfortable as it just simply caught me off guard if this had been any other coworker i would not even thought twice about it i felt like he artificially created the task just to get near me i have read about how a <type> can gaze but i was hoping someone could shed some light on why an <type> stares secretly when they are not upset i hate to talk myself up but i am usually good at reading body language but he leaves me so perplexed as to his motives am i overthinking this and was he just trying to study me    was this a poor social attempt using his physical instinct to create a situation to try to bond    or perhaps he has a sexual attraction towards me    if so   i read my <type> personality is not one they typically like i am curious to understand why an <type> would secretly stare 
istj,i know stereotypicallisation is n t good but its fun   sometimes so   lets get your thinking caps on   jog your memory for all stereotypical <type>  s you have seen and even try a little intuition i personally imagine an <type> to look very formal looking even in their casual clothes   they would be well groomed and dressed <type> girls   i imagine to have a massive purse handbag prepared for any challenges   has her hair tied in a ponytail bun hairclip office suits are suitable for both genders faded jeans with holes in it seems like a definite no go zone one who appears serious and even nerdish to a certain extent but lovable with animals boys will have adequate sized hair not too long e g not over the shoulders glasses could fit in nicely though are not necessary carrying a few books around for reading is also a probability oh yes   did i mention that if the shoes are black and leather made then they would definitely be polished    now   i am not sure if this has been addressed before and i hope it is n t i also admit that i stole this idea from <type> part of the forum but i am curious to hear of your replies    
esfp,hello <type>s   in this interview   i got a chance to talk to jonathan about what it  s like to be an <type> se te pc s    b    mf the first thing we talked about is jonathan  s belief that we should all be equal and the whole talk about race is getting in the way of bigger life problems we spent some time talking about racism   especially since we are both minorities   and experiencing it in north america jonathan talked about doing a pilgrimage to west africa where his ancestral roots were and he said he loved the feeling of blending in with everyone and people wanting to get to know him for him instead of his race he did mention one funny thing that people still knew he was american because he said when he went there   he was fat we then talked about other issues that he perceived as bigger problems such as the economy jonathan talked about his background in sports and fitness and how he would use his energy dominant goofiness to engage his clients he said he has trouble with the nt blast and does n t feel comfortable using it even if he has a degree in sports science we finished up the interview talking about him being audio and kinaesthetic watch this interview here 
isfp,ignore my signature   i could be a mistyped <type> sx   i hate rules that do not make any sense to me   and this is why i often think i m an xxtp type i fucking hate rules   especially if they make little sense for example not being allowed to go to my mother  s house whenever there is no adult to supervise    i m      this is fucking ridiculous      or putting all of the food in the kitchen in food storage bags whenever opened such a stupid rule 
esfj,i hear that  s the ideal partner for an <type> i do n t know if i have ever even met an <type>    so wondering what it  s like to date one    from some of what i read on the    personality  s website it sounded like someone i would wanna date so yeah any input on this would be great also where to find one    since im introverted lol and im female btw if that makes any difference 
isfj,i think i know the reason why i m so damn lazy yes   being an <type>   makes it so i m already predisposed to being lazy   but i believe having an <type> mother only exacerbates the problem why    because she does everything for me she will tell me to do stuff and then being typical me i  ll procrastinate until i finally work up the will to do it only   when i m about to go do it i discover that it  s already been done i suppose that  s nice thing to discover that something i do n t really want to do has been done   but it also makes me feel even more useless what  s worse is that because i know she will eventually do it i will not try as hard to work up the will power to do it myself when i try to talk about it with her she gets offended that what she does actually hurts me in a way so   she throws up her hands and says fine do it all yourself   she  ll stop for a while but then it goes back to the way it was before this creates a vicious circle of sloth for me i know she does it because      she cares about me and likes doing things for me and      she gets impatient and would rather just do it herself than wait for me to do it could i get your perspective on this <type>s

infj,i posted this in the <type> forum for their perspective   but i would also love to hear from fellow <type>s on this i am very confused about this relationship i have never considered a relationship with an <type> before because we are just so different   but woah   what is this <type> <type> thing    context he  s late   s and i m late     s i m <type>   and he  s <type> we were friends for a few years and spoke every few days about our mutual career i  ve always been very fond of him but he  s overly social and i never thought of him in a romantic way because we are so very vert different honestly   i always thought he was a bit of a player because he was at social events always   he  s very good looking   he has many women who are friends with him   and i have n t known him to have any long term relationships over   years   months ago after discovering i was single   he started flirting with me i did n t respond initially because it felt quite surface level he focused a lot on my looks and i felt it was a bit too sexualised so i backed away from it and shut it down much to my surprise   he contacted me a week later very bluntly telling he would not allow me to run away from this and that we needed to talk   and we did for hours he confessed that he had wanted me romantically since the moment we met   but he never pursued it because i was in a relationship i was very honest about how i was n t interested in something casual with him and that for that reason   i shut it down he responded that he feels a deep intellectual and emotional connection with me and that the sexual aspect is only one part that he  s interested in he told me he wanted a relationship with me   not something casual   and that we were going to navigate this together    his communication ability is insanely sexy    so i decided to give it a shot and   omg since the very first night i agreed to go on a date with him   it has been crazy off the charts chemistry   connection and passion and fun and amazing friendship and laughter and happiness we spend nearly all day bantering back and forth together and the sexual connection is other worldly we have not said i love you  s   but last week    he was a bit drunk    he told me   he  s never felt this way before and he does n t know what i have done to  bewitch him  so fully   that he had given up on ever finding  his person  but i was right under his nose all along   and   that he has no doubt that we will be spending the rest of our lives together i was very taken aback by his  confessions  because i know he is not emotionally expressive usually   and he  s also very serious with his words he prides himself on his honesty and integrity he has never wanted to marry anyone before   and he  s never said this to any past relationship person but it is very sexual it feels very intense very soon he tells me      how beautiful and sexy i am he is very focused on my body and my looks he  s very focused on what i wear and how feminine i am i am freaking out that it  s some sort of infatuation and that he  s wrong about his feelings for me he does n t ask me many questions about my life   and when i asked him why he did n t   he said he has been observing me for years and knows more about me than i realise i asked him what he knows about me and he gave me a huge long synopsis about my    very hidden    personality and he was     accurate he is so intuitive is this normal for an <type>    he is so good at working me out which has never happened before also   he is involved in a lot of social groups and is busy all of the time   he wants me to go to them with him but i am an introvert and have a very busy life so i do n t while he  s at the events   he still texts me several times saying he  s thinking of me   i m so beautiful   etc   and then when he gets home i have     of his attention   but it seems like his social events always come first not sure what is happening here everything seems so conflicting any advice much appreciated 
istp,hello <type>s   in this interview   i got a chance to talk to heather on what it  s like to be an <type> ti se cs b    p    fm this interview was super interesting because you rarely get a chance to talk to an officially typed <type> female they almost do n t exist   and to make this another rare interview opportunity   heather is also the super rare fm <type>   one thing i noticed was that because of gender roles   an <type> female like heather has better use of her fe than male <type>s heather also has double masculine nf blast    ni fe    making her nf quite strong she is still doing the typical <type> st report    ti se      but because it  s double feminine   it  s not as in your face as her ni fe because of her play last    se fe      she tends to lose energy rather quickly and she also disrespects sf play as a result she  s aware of how important sf is but she hates it so it  s work in progress for her to improve on it she  s also looking to doing more hiit based cardio exercise to increase her energy levels which is what she has the most issues with because she  s still an ixxp   she has people problems and has dealt with tribe hate   especially in her younger days overall   it was an insightful interview and there are definitely some differences when you see the male and female variations of the same personality type watch the interview here 
intp,shit i need help i m new to relationships because i only really became open to the possibility this year but do any other <type>s have relationship issues as in whenever you see the person or going to see the person youre in a relationship with   you get anxiety    i m not good at any part of the relationship i got anxiety so bad that i ended up having health problems because of my anxiety and stress levels reached a new high do n t get me wrong you like the person you  re seeing but something in you ends up thinking that relationships do n t feel realistic they feel like they do n t belong with other forms of interaction and because of this sporadic variable   you do n t feel in control do you guys have this    also   do you worry about wasting your time if it does n t go right    i do n t know how to control it i feel fine when i m with them   but i can feel the anxiety rising as time goes on especially after leaving them but i know this is something i  ve got to get used to i do n t talk to many people at all i do n t have friends so this is a big step for me especially because the guy im seeing is an extrovert if you <type>s have in fact experienced this   can you let me know how you got over it    please not just time it can be some sort of thought psychology that you had   some mentality it can be actual physical methods i do n t care just anything 
isfj,i m a    year old <type> currently living with my parents because that  s how it kind of is in korea i  ve been job searching for a while now   and it has been a really difficult time i  ve been really stressed and most of the time   try to just stay in my room and work on my job search now   with my mom i have always found her somewhat difficult since i was little she  s funny   friendly   and incredibly outgoing in social situations she  s also very caring to me and my brother   shows a lot of love   works way too hard on house chores but she also has weird mood changes and can be quite rough on us i often feel like i have to walk on eggshells around her because of having to predict what mood she  s currently in she  s kind of the type who complains about me not helping out at home and that she has to do everything    even though i insist on helping and do chores   but she keeps on telling me not to      but when i do help   she complains how it  s not up to her expectations she always says   i should  ve just done it this really annoyed me for a while but i think she knows how much i m trying and how i m not just sitting around and not helping her out she has n t really complained about it nowadays but her mood changes stress me out the most she seems fine and friendly   laughing and joking around with me one day   and then the next day   it  s as if she  s mad at me about something i do n t know if she  s actually mad   but the way she talks to me sounds kind of indifferent or like she does n t want to deal with me so she tries to not talk to me it drives me crazy and i find myself crying often because i do n t know how to deal with it i can feel the room so much that i can just feel when something  s off it  s like that right now yesterday she sent me a bunch of funny videos while i was out   and today she barely looks at me or talks to me why does she do that    i know <type>s also need some alone time and space   but i feel like an idiot for even trying to alleviate the atmosphere i feel like i m going crazy because i keep wondering if it  s just me   or if it really is her mood swings if she  s not happy with me   i know it  s because i ca n t find a job yet i m stressed out too and really getting into that depression hole   but i m trying every single day to send in applications and go through that tiresome process i wonder if she actually thinks i m doing nothing and just hanging out in my room all day how do i deal with this    is she just tired and needs alone time    i wish i were less sensitive to her mood changes   but i ca n t i just have to wait and see until she begins joking around with me again

isfj,i just made this thread about birthdays http personalitycafe com cognitive functions       si fe birthdays html post        i was curious to see what other <type>s thought about the topic i  ve heard other types say that sfjs are really big on birthday celebrations because of the tradition involved this makes sense due to si and fe but for me   this plays out in a different way i do n t think a birthday should mean someone has to have a big party however   i do think that there  s an unwritten   social rule that a birthday is one day where someone should get whatever they want   even if it goes against traditional celebrations so my si and fe lead me to have this belief that has no real basis in logic   but is also not the conventional way of looking at birthdays i was curious to see how this compared to other <type>s 
esfp,i would like to know what you guys think of the <type>s 
intp,the idea of eventually marrying or settling with someone makes me sick   for some reason about the same feeling goes for finding a fixed job position and maintaining it this is just my current state though at the same time   i wonder how feasible is it for anyone to not settle ever    i see being a free spirit as a very desirable condition   at least for me   until about       after that   i m not sure again   the idea of settling   even at    or whatever   makes me sick   but at the same time i cannot help but wonder if one would n t start going mad after a certain age   or if there is a threshold age such that if you change idea after that   you most likely wo n t succeed at settling because it  s simply too late and everyone is taken except for ludicrous people that nobody wants and even if you succeed   what if you then regret changing your mind    what if instead you did n t change your mind   but then regret not changing your mind    i do n t know   i m confused it seems to me there is no info about this everybody talks about marriage   having a steady job   settling for life   but nobody talks about living as a free spirit and thus we do n t even know if it  s an hard thing to do or how viable it is i would be most intrigued if there are any studies on this how happy are   on average   those people who never settle    do they even exist    i do n t even know where to look discuss 
entj,if there  s one personality type that i  ll never understand unless i ask someone who has the type personally about how they act and what their thought processes looked like   it  s you guys   the <type>s i do n t understand why i can grasp every single type that does n t have ni as their dominant or auxiliary function   especially auxiliaries   probably due to a lack of ni based knowledge because i know so little about you guys   i can only really use stereotypes and blanket statements as of now stereotypes such as cruelly and coldly efficient plan makers   but that does n t fit right with me no matter how much i try and convince myself so   basically   what makes an <type> tick    what do you strive for    how are you like around others    what  s your take on your extraversion    how does an inferior fi work with you guys    tertiary se    what  s something you look most forward to in life       do n t answer all of these   i got a little sidetracked and just kept coming up with questions to ask      thanks   
esfp,not a very active forum i hope this gets responses anyhow and i do mean relationships as in friend or potentially more any type of relationship dynamics between these types so i  ve been talking to this <type> online and so far i find him really intriguing he  s only taken one mbti test   and from what he says it  s mostly accurate he  s older   single dad   so life has taken over for him so far i actually like him and we have good conversations   but some of the things i  ve read about <type>  s   like their avoidance of problems   that concern me being an <type>   subjects such as problem solving are areas i spend most of my time and frankly i enjoy facing problems head on and using those involved to help me come to a good solution i  d like to know if anyone here has had experience with <type>  s and how that dynamic worked 
istp,i m not being stereotypical with this question let  s be real for a moment though   ti se ni does like to tinker with stuff applying that ti towards something tangible like a homegrown macgyver when it  s developed that way of course my neighbor was wanting to borrow a tool   i went ahead and let him use my multi tool pliers i knew that in doing so might not of been a good idea   especially since he lacks in actually fixing something i figured he would more than likely need yet another tool so i just handed him the multi tool mostly so he would n t keep asking for this and that   ya  know since my neighbor is one of those types who thinks borrowing equals he owns it the next day after he was done messing with his bike   i mentioned do you have the pliers that  s my favorite tool for little things around the apartment toss it in drawer and later bam that cabinet door knob is loose no more he starts looking for it i m telling him it  s alright i  ll just get it later he finally finds it in the bag on the bike well   one side of the needle nose pliers was bent enough where you can put a nut between the hole the tension was shot   not worth messing with he of course automatically started saying i did n t do it blah blah blah i ended giving him the set are you sure i thought this was your favorite one   he said i told him yeah it was you can have it now though my question how pissed off would that make you    i know i know   you would n t of let someone borrow your favorite tool anyway to be fair it was just a cheap one and i do have a small one also 
estp,i have realized there is no thread for this on the <type> forum and am curious to see what everybody says
enfj,the <type> doorslam is a classic move in which <type>s will completely cut someone out of their lives once they  ve had enough however   they rarely bother to tell the person they  re just done it  s a very introverted action i  ve had an <type> doorslam me once   and she made sure i knew what she was doing and why this makes me wonder if it is an extroverted trait to tell people what they  ve done wrong and how things are going to be have you ever pulled an <type> doorslam   and if so   did you tell the person or were you silent about it    
isfp,first of all   i m an <type> female i have never had a relationship with an <type> and to my awareness do n t have any friends who are <type> however   i m in the beginning stages of getting to know a guy who is <type> we have been talking for   weeks so it is super new we hung out alone for the  st time the other night and i know he  s interested in me i have n t heard from him since but he hearted a response i put on his wall the next day my sense is that he is a bit scared but is interested and that in time he  ll emerge from the cave that he went back into anyways   i  d appreciate any thoughts to help me understand <type>  s in relationships thank you
istp,so i got to thinking that there are a lot of superficial similarities i find that when i casually try to type someone in my head   i have a difficult time with telling the difference although the differences are significant   do you think it  s possible for <type>s and <type>s to mistype themselves    if so   why    
esfp,hello <type>s   in this interview   i got a chance to talk to jaxson about what it  s like to be an <type> se fi cp b    s    mf first   jaxson started the interview by talking about his uncontrollable consume and gathering it  s so bad that when he gets what he wants   he has trouble appreciating it and wants to get the next bigger and better thing recently   he  s been working hard at buying a home and he  s getting a sense of deep appreciation for the work it took to be able to get one he came to realize that the journey to get something can sometimes be more rewarding than having the thing itself jaxson also talked about his fear of the abstract and talked about believing in vampires and werewolves he also talked about fearing the nefarious ni plan where someone can trap him somewhere he talked about watching a movie about a cult that traps people only to hack them up and he  s truly scared that these kinds of things do exist in real life jaxson said he is going to work on his nf sleep last moving forward watch this interview here 
esfj,i  ve just taken michael caloz  s test   and the top   results were <type> and <type> i would have been an <type> if my si was n t as high both my fe and fi are on an equal level what i need to discover is which one i developed first the test showed that i use very little ti and no ni the michael caloz cognitive functions test want to better understand who you are    unlike other    types tests   this one goes way beyond the usual   letters to explore the deeper cognitive functions www michaelcaloz com i m not an <type>   as my fe is too high for that my fe has been doing keys of ketamine and taking ecstasy pills   it has no real    se    conception of reality   and without ti   i have to process my ideas through other people before i trust my perceptions of what  s going on around me if it developed first   then <type> ese might be just as likely what confuses me is how i could be typed as a ne dom if i scored     on the judging trait    conscientiousness    on the big      personalities test bouquet of ghosts assertive commander    <type> a      personalities www   personalities com     organised seems too high for a type that revels in chaos and may also be higher in trait neuroticism at least now i know that i m the <type> and my grandma is an <type>   not the other way around 
estj,thinkers are often thought to be cool headed and calm it is normal for <type>s to rarely display anger and not having frequent angry outbursts    
intp,in another topic   i was trying to think of something that could describe ti written and viewed by an <type> in order to clearly separate ti from the usual ti ne mental masturbation from my point of view   ti is too often associated with <type>   and it often leads to a huge misconception about ti the best example of <type> philosopher i had in mind was miyamoto musashi    japanese master swordsman   painter   and author    example of ti life rules    written by <type>    the    precepts of dokkodo the way of walking alone by miyamoto musashi   accept everything just the way it is   do not seek pleasure for its own sake   do not   under any circumstances   depend on a partial feeling   think lightly of yourself and deeply of the world   be detached from desire your whole life long   do not regret what you have done   never be jealous   never let yourself be saddened by a separation   resentment and complaint are appropriate neither for oneself or others    do not let yourself be guided by the feeling of lust or love    in all things have no preferences    be indifferent to where you live    do not pursue the taste of good food    do not hold on to possessions you no longer need    do not act following customary beliefs    do not collect weapons or practice with weapons beyond what is useful    do not fear death    do not seek to possess either goods or fiefs for your old age    respect buddha and the gods without counting on their help    you may abandon your own body but you must preserve your honour    never stray from the way the guy spent his life aimlessly traveling and recklessly killing people    caricature    he wrote it one week before dying       years old    and it more or less resume his lifestyle internal rules even as an <type>    who prefers to brawl with abstact thoughts concepts   and wo n t spend her life going into physical brawls    i think his dokkodo the way of walking alone represents ti perfectly even the title is perfect of course   it does n t mean that every ti strong users has the same principles   but there are a lot of common points the rules are very short but they actually took a lifetime life research to reach them there  s also the attachment to reach internal peace without being dependent of the external world   and without being strayed by feelings desires partiality customary beliefs    take neutral inputs    the need of independence is very strong i find this example very relevant this clearly reeks of ti ness neutrality impartiality with very very low chance to mistake it for fi even though we  re talking of life precepts and honor this also shows why ti is often associated with rebellion    do not act following customary beliefs never stray from the way implied   just fuck off people trying to take control of you   and just do what  s relevant    with being unemotional even though we do have feelings    do not   under any circumstances   depend on a partial feeling    being   very   very laid back with low will to control the outer world    accept everything just the way it is    i personally find this text very inspiring fellow <type>s   what do you think about that    do you recognize your ti in this    or is it just me    thank you in advance for your inputs edit   i m not asking for a ti definition discussion debate there are plenty of these on perc i m asking you    ti dom aux    if you recognize you in this   and if these principles speak to you specifically so   no abstract conceptual discussion and debates please   but more personal experiences and lifestyles sharing discussions thank you in advance for sticking on the thread  s subject edit   if you have inspiring texts on the same subject you want to share   i would be more than happy to read them   
intp,according to this article many <type>s are interested in photography i m just wondering if you would call yourself a photographer   and   if so   what type of pictures do you normally take    to start it off   i would definitely call myself a photographer and i  ve been playing with cameras for the past   years my favourite pictures to take are abstract minimalist macros with interesting colours   although normally each my photographs only manage to incorporate one or two of those ideas i also enjoy experimenting with other types of photography   but i m not often as happy with my work in those areas right now my camera is a canon rebel 
intj,i used to be very much into weight lifting i have a sort of innate intelligence for it my body is also naturally hypertrophic i m built like a caveman and it was my obsession until i had an accident preventing me from doing it    probably forever    so i now work for myself from my computer indoors i m also accompanied by a host of health problems i  ve set my goals towards chasing millions   but i realize this wo n t be fulfilling or probably even that rewarding this is probably the first time in    years that i  ve not really had some over arching long term goal to propel me forward in life i do have goals   but due to ongoing health issues   i ca n t consistently or reliably do them when i want to i find i m interested in topics such as space   physics and philosophy   but not much more as i see it   if i ca n t use my body then i can use my mind and what is more interesting than trying to unravel the mysteries of the universe   understand existence   or encompass the entirety of reality in ones mind although the big problem is that my intelligence constrains me from actually pursuing these subjects to any level that is worthwhile   or any level that would make it feel fulfilling to me i feel like i m going through life running software that constantly exceeds my hardware  s capability there is a lot of curiosity and interest   but not enough processing power to actually run the program to a level that would produce anything worth running the program in other words   you really cannot do much in terms of physics or philosophy with an average or slightly above average iq you just ca n t people will say you can   but you really ca n t you could spend years and years learning only for someone with an iq north of     spending a month on the subject and completely blow you out of the water and anything you achieve will be pointless in the grand scheme you will constantly be fighting against the grain and hit your intellectual ceiling on these subjects very early since i lost the only thing i ever truly enjoyed   at this point i really only want to do something if i feel i can reach a high level of understanding and actually accomplish something the monotonous daily grind of a full time job or even being self employed and running some online ecommerce stores aka being entrepreneur financially successful still feels unfulfilling but without a higher intelligence there is n t really much you can chase after that would be this has led me to odd subjects like conspiracy theories   remote viewing   subjective probabilistic theories of reality   spirituality   meditation   aliens   etc but at the back of my mind   i know they are likely all fiction and i m just trying to latch onto something interesting   fulfilling   mysterious   etc i  ve always been avoidant and disliked being around people   found friends who i actually liked still predictable and boring girlfriends and such are the same ultimately when you combine this kind of mentality with an <type> personality and all that comes with it you have a recipe for disaster my issac newton type lifestyle would be justifiable if i had an issac newton iq it  s gotten so bad i  ve been considering living in an rv next to a creek or a shack in the woods does anyone else feel something similar to this apologies if this is all over the place   it  s very late

esfp,i am an <type>    occasionally <type>    and i have known an <type> for a few years i want to be with him he experiences highs    energetic   confident   fun   social   likeable    and lows    anxiety attacks   stress   bored easily   feeling like a failure   upset when criticized   catastrophises   histrionic    we are not in a relationship and we see each other every few months he works in a different country sometimes he comes back to my country to visit his family and sometimes i visit that country because i have siblings there we get along really well and have been friends for a long time we speak every day and he says i m the closest to him we admitted we had feelings for each other and he said he wants to be with me however he has no plans to move to my country i often think about moving but he told me not to move country to only be with him because it  s too much pressure i understand and i agree with him however we will not magically be in the same country unless we make a decision and plan he says he hopes we end up together in the future my question is in two parts      he tells me every day that he misses me   he wishes i was there etc   he makes up scenarios where we are living together and he jokes about marrying me and meeting his family i honestly do n t understand why he says these things if he has no intention of us being together is it a joke    does he actually want these things    does he say it because he  s bored and can easily say it to any other girl    should i tell him to stop saying those things if they are n t true    but if i restrict him i worry his feelings would fade if he ca n t share with me his daydreams and feelings should i let him continue so that his feelings grow for me and eventually he will really make plans to be together         when i do talk to him about more practical things   such as his plans for us being together   when we are next booking flights to see each other   that i m willing to relocate for him etc   he disappears for days    very strange when we speak daily    sometimes he gets back in contact to tell me i m stressing him out   or sometimes i get back in contact with him and try to be light hearted and say sorry for making things serious   then we resume our normal fun   sweet conversation where he tells me he misses me and wants me there but it  s very annoying because i think i ca n t rely on him when things get tough and he  s going to disappear each time he feels like i m hinting at commitment how can you communicate to an <type> who wants you but does n t make plans to be with you    i ultimately want to end up with him 
entj,just wondering cause all rationals people are suppose to be so call smart   
isfp,i went to my mother  s house today    which i love doing because i know it sounds stupid but every time i go there i frequently find joints on the floor in the local region and compulsively smoke them because i do n t know any dealers    but immediately got kicked out because i swore at my father because i was angry with him because he was angry with me i got stoned anyway   and my day was pleasantly interrupted with an edt appointment   but i was just so sad and pissed off with myself because of what i did i hate how impulsive i am i hate how i never think about the possibilities and potential consequences of my actions it makes me feel like a mistyped se dom and being an <type> sounds even worse than being an <type> because i do n t want to be perceived as unintelligent i wish i was an xntp because it is my identity later that day   when i went for a walk in the kid  s home area   i found no joints whatsoever and tried smoking cigarettes    which helped but only temporarily    i am a transgender male with an eating disorder and i encountered this attractive thin young man who said a witty comment and had a deeper voice than mine and i feel really jealous of him i also remember crying because other people were making fun of me    combined with reflecting over what i did    i hate it when my mother sends my smartphone text messages such as you have to think about the consequences of your actions crap along those lines it  s just so inconsiderate does this make me sx     am i a mistyped <type>    i do n t want to be when i got home i also realized how ugly my hair is 
esfp,hi   i wanted to ask you guys if you know of the evil side of <type>  s generally i  ve been called bubbly   cute   entertaining and my sister even says i have a personality of cinderella  s godmother lol i admit i m happier when i make other ppl happy i m good with troubleshooting and all but i do feel we <type>  s have a dark side it ca n t be just attention seeking we have a stereotype of being dumb which i feel shows the irrationality of the person judging us we ar pretty smart do any of you know any <type>  s with a dark side or for u <type>s out there   can u think of anything u find within urself    just curious 
isfp,your opinion is appreciated   i m on the fence with typing a friend of mine and it  s driving me crazy here  s a description of him he  s very musically gifted and plays the drums   trumpet   piano   and anything else he can get his hands on he  s a dancer   particularly good at ballroom dancing and is a master at swing dance everyone is his friend   and he  ll do nearly anything to help someone in need or to make someone feel better as long as it does n t go against his morals   and he  s irresistibly charming very involved in his church and leads the children  s ministry he loves children   and they  re drawn to him he  s very smart   remembers a lot of facts and details and very clever   but he dropped out of college after his first semester currently working as a carpenter in the family business with his dad and brother   and also does gardening he  s very athletic   and he loves nature an expert in all things outdoors   and an adventurous mountaineer last year he drove to maine with his friend to camp out in the mountains for   weeks and climb he  s very social   and is almost always doing something with somebody an avid reader with a active imagination he loves to dress up and role play involved in musical theater   always landing lead parts always very concerned with the emotional needs of others   but has a hard time focusing on one person if there  s a lot of other people around in conversation he can be buoyant   witty   loud   quick   energetic   and fun   but he can also be quiet and gentle he  s not afraid to hug people   especially cuddly with his family members   and he makes friends effortlessly because everyone wants to be near him as a kid he was a loner and was intimidated by people he spent most of his time in the woods by himself running around barefoot   reading   and building model planes he still does this actually   and still is barefoot most of the time we call him a hobbit   which suits him well he  s the most richly alive person i  ve ever met i think that  s why i m having a hard time typing him

istj,dear brethren <type>s   i am hopelessly crushing on a friend of a friend i m    and a widow   but i feel like a teenager right now so far   i ve only been around him three times   in the context of a social gathering that the mutual friend arranges without cutie there   i m bubbly and assertive and relaxed with the others he shows up   and i get awkward and silent and stare at my shoes typical <type> reaction he s very nice to everyone   including me   and i m just sitting there tongue tied and staring at the freckles on his arms   mentally recording what he says and the shape of his eyebrows and the color of his shoe laces   to journal in detail when i get home yes   i even walked up to his truck in the dark parking lot   to see what his birth month was on the license plate    may    this past weekend   two of the gang    <type> and <type>    both asked with concern whether i was feeling all right or something bad had happened to me   because i was sitting there like a lump   not smiling   silent   and looking down at the floor well   <type> had taken my seat when i went to the bathroom so that she could talk to the person next to me   and so when i got back   i had to take her seat   which was directly in front of cutie   i was paralyzed him what city in country of childhood did you grow up in    me um   uh to add a layer of complexity   i ve typed him as <type>   so he has that easygoing physicality that <type>s have   a very physical presence without doing or saying anything i feel overwhelmed by both my feelings for him and by his physical presence bottom line if you ve had a relationship with someone you first crushed on   how did you get over the overwhelm and social paralysis    he s single and in an appropriate age group for me   and i m not in a hurry   but i would like to get to know him better   slowly like an <type> or a tortoise   which would be impossible if i m a petrified statue every time he s in the room this did not come up when i met my late husband   because i did not have a crush on him and we were friends first without me suspecting that i d develop feelings for him later will i ever feel comfortable around this guy    does an <type> crush ever morph into a relationship    how did you get over the paralysis    
intj,first of all   context i met her in february and it was very casual   just things like hi   how are you    kisses on a cheek   hugs and all of that but things got more real   months ago   when i begin to feel a strong connection and understandment with her we begin talking more frecuently through text   most of the time she was the first one in sending a message   asking for my hobbies   where did i live and all that stuff   making emphasis in my interest in mathematics and physics even though she is not very good at it then came something that i call the proximity paradox she begin to sit next to me at every moment   following me wherever i went and leaving me alone when i was stressed or tired   sudden physicall touches but also she stopped kissing or huging me by this moment she does it but feels weird   but i notice that she keeps giving that kind of affection with acquaintances and friends   so i do n t know during this last   months she has been very kind to me   helping me when i need it   giving compliments about my intelligence   my clothes   my personality   sometimes just being there   giving me gifts like paper planes that she made   chocolates   drawings and recently taking me pictures but this thing when she mention her ex    few times    or when she mention that was seeing a guy in february but making very clear that was just as friends or recently when she mention how she try to date an attractive guy   months ago by buying a postal   makes me thing that i m just her friend last week   in a conversation about trust she mention that most of the time she enjoys her loneliness but sometimes needs someone that understands she is very closed off about her emotions and personal things with almost everyone and do n t have someone else on that line so   generally speaking   i do n t know and lately i  ve been thinking about confessing my feelings and i would be very happy to hear all of your comments i do n t have trouble with honesty cause i think it  s better   even if it hurts 
infj,i m going to get roasted   but here we go    yr relationship and marriage to <type> which i totally damaged by being insensitive   blind   uncaring   lacked understanding   selfish   and entitled just to name a few i was largely oblivious to who she really was as a person she tried the first decade for harmony and equality   accommodation   recognition and more slowly she closed off and distanced for the next decade just to keep family together and keep peace   avoid stress and conflict for several years now she contemplated leaving only recently after i had a breakthrough and saw myself as being the reason for most of the unhappiness did i realize who she was and what i had missed and done to her and our marriage i was profoundly sorry and regretful i owned it all a few weeks later she asked for a separation i also was aware of her new platonic relationship with her boss   mentor   friend   confidant they relate on multiple levels   particularly communication   interests   humor and profession he  s even more introverted we  ve reconciled i ca n t believe it still living together and in counseling i m the luckiest man on the planet   to get another chance with her i  ve learned an immense amount about her that i  d totally missed or never looked for in the past i get and see and understand her like i never had before i now love and care for her multiple times more and it is the most beautiful   intriguing   attractive   heartwarming feeling i could imagine she actually came back into our marriage and has turned towards me i m ecstatic i  ve changed multiple things about myself and how i acted with her i want this relationship   love and marriage more than anything she also has not changed any of her incessant engagement with her boss after hours   regardless of how i  ve felt about it she engages with him morning and night   whether i m there or not she seeks out interests of his and shares interests of hers i trust her unconditionally he has a history of infidelity   with a previous subordinate in her current role i know he cares deeply for her and is likely in love with her she has not engaged generally like that with him   but i know his intentions are to have a relationship with her if she allowed it   even with her marriage she has said multiple times that i have nothing to worry about i know she wo n t have a physical relationship with him if she is still in her marriage he  s not aware of our situation   but obviously as an intuitive   sees her needs clearly we are planning trips and a future with our growing family of grandchildren what can i do to protect her from him    what can i do to protect myself    how can this possibly play out    i m intimidated and feel inadequate i probably deserve it all i m so regretful that this happened to her   to us she deserved a better marriage   i m going to try and give it to her now   for the rest of my life 
entj,hi all   recently i  ve let down an <type> that i value very much some factors combined let to me being much less efficient in meeting our common goal   which clearly led to this <type> being frustrated now i want to apologize i mean   i  ve already done so   but it feels like it did n t really work   as they kinda retreated inwards or something so   i would really love to get some help and advice how to apologize to an <type> properly    thanks in advance

entj,my sister is an <type>   mom   well liked in her community by a large circle of friends she has a lot of girlfriends   throws parties and other types of gatherings events several times a year she has a fairly calm demeanor and harmony focused when it comes to the group she does n t speak up or advocate for herself   even when she really should does n t want to rock the boat or cause problems i   on the other hand   am a train wreck when it comes to socialability not that i m an awkward dork who ca n t drum up conversation and have a good time kind of the opposite tbh and for sure i m a very intense person to be around and realize that people do n t always appreciate the force of my personality    note i m something like   th percentile for assertiveness and  th percentile for politeness in big      so in terms of personal relationships   i stick with a very small group of people that can handle being around me    my <type> partner   an <type> girlfriend and an <type> girlfriend    so the other day my sister advises that i need to make more friends for my kids  sake    in grade   and grade      that i should get to know my kids  friends parents   invite them over   be friendly   etc that i should n t be so reclusive and anti social    funny coming from an introvert    well   i strongly prefer that a friendship with another human develops organically rather than out of obligation and i  ve genuinely already tried to be friends with other mommies   who always seem to be busy or unavailable when i reach out for the kids  sake to do something i wo n t chase anyone for any reason   especially a social reason if they want to socialize with me   i m fine with that but no way i m going to keep reaching out if there is no reciprocity admittedly   i do n t care much for making friends if i think i ca n t be myself around them but i see my sister  s point in a way what can i do to not fuck it up and make myself more likeable and agreeable    is it possible to fake being a shrinking violet    the thought makes me feel slimy and inauthentic

infp,dear fellow <type>s   what is the most important cause or belief you  d be willing to compromise or change for the sake of practicality or compromise with others    at some point i am going to confess the danger of compromising a conviction

intp,hello   i m on a bit of a quest to figure out if there are any other highly sensitive <type>  s on here i currently have my profile as <type>   although my t is only slightly higher than my f a year ago i read the highly sensitive person   and it made a vast difference in my life i am very tuned into my environment and very sensitive to smells   sights   pain   etc i am a high sensation seeker   however   so i do at times seek out opportunities to  stimulate  myself be it through listening to powerful music   riding roller coasters   running into a freezing lake at night   watching thrillers   etc    just so long as i can retreat to a peaceful land afterwards    i always thought myself to be very feely   simply in the sense that i am very aware of how people feel   and it is important to me to interact with someone in a way that they will understand i do make an effort not to offend people   and harmony is important to me as i do not like emotional disruption however   i have always felt incredibly frustrated with how different i am from other women    and people in general    clarification this is not in the sense of i wish i was like everyone else rather   i hate that i cannot articulate these thoughts to people and have them understand or be able to converse with me i have always despised how mushy and shallow and emotional people tend to generally be it never seems like i feel emotional at times when it seems like most people are   and the only way i know how to comfort someone who is upset is by logically walking through the situation and seeking a solution i have learned how to comfort people with physical touch or empathetic words   simply because i can read people   but it always is an awkward experience for me when i personally experience emotion   it is chaotic and completely drains the life out of me i probably get upset once or twice a month    or week   depending on my hormones   ha      and when i do i m in a horrid depression it  s during these depressions that i seem more feely than humanly possible   and i grow even more upset because i know my feelings are utterly illogical and i can see what i should rationally do or feel   but cannot do anything about it until my emotional wave passes i am fascinated by art   science   nature   animals   patterns   codes   puzzles   and systems i want to love people   because i admire people who have a heart for broken people   but i m a little overwhelmed by human beings i prefer reading things that intelligent or insightful people have written   or talking with someone about what they think about certain things i have an easy time talking with kids    i talk to them like they are another adult   not like they are plushy babies      and playing with them   but i do not enjoy being around children or babies when they are upset or fussy or are causing trouble it seems there is no rubric for dealing with them and that scares me      the same often applies to adults haha    anyhow   that  s probably enough for now i guess i am just seeking to find out if there are other <type>  s out there who are highly sensitive and or have a thing for the more creative artistic sides of the world    not that we do n t all love the things that <type>s love   but you know what i mean    i look forward to reading some responses   and hey   even if you  re not at all sensitive   i would love to hear what you think    maybe i m simply an <type> with a lot of emotional problems    erc  barefoot mango
intj,hi everyone   been reading for a bit the forum and wanted to ask as the title says for some advice   i hope this is the correct place so   i  ve been with my gf for about   months for a little backstory   we met because mutual friends got to know each other at first the   of us played video games and to get to know each other   and after that i added her to discord we talked more and more each day and get to know each other   about our hobbies   what we studied and all that during our talks on discord the mbti was mentioned and she told me that she was <type> and i talked to her that i had as a result <type> <type>    i m more as a feeler but i m not sure which one i am lol    eventually we get to know more each other and started to really like her   we get on dates and be more comfortable with each other i noticed that she was very touchy   with hugs and kisses   and very open in our conversations and in person we start our relationship and everything was very good and having a good time   but one time she mentioned to me that she was thinking on returning to her city where her parents live to study a masters and even more to ask if she could work remotely due to some problems within her work i have to say she is very focused on that part professionally i showed to her my support and that i would be fine even at a long distance   we planned more of our future as a relationship even with the distance and the hopes to move together later on but as the date that she was going to fly to her city   i noticed that she was a bit more distant   i thought that it was with all the things and changes to come and did n t show any concern i was still supporting her fast forward   i noticed that she was more and more distant we talk mostly by text but mostly phone calls or anything i was mostly initiating and that was starting to get me to feel a bit anxious and insecure i talked about to her the change of it   and she responded to me that she was starting to reconnect more with friends and her family   as well her work was starting to become more busy and appreciated the concern because she understood that she can forgot to respond texts or be a bit of absent on some of her friendships for example i thanked her response and was a bit more relieved but still sometimes i m a bit frustrated that mostly i need to initiate the contact or to think that if i do n t do anything or ask or something we would n t even talk or anything it  s not just the distance but the connection that i m a bit worried one personal thing is that my previous relationship was a bit unstable like discussions and be with the emotions all over the place and with her it has been so   stable    so am i just not accustumed and everything is good    would like to ask for some advice on how to navigate or be more conscious with her   what can i do more or do less    thanks   
estj,i have two right now   my manager she takes time to look into what i m saying she wants to help individuals and the company both which is the best way to go in my opinion her intensions are great she gives the benefit of the doubt   which i see as a huge part of her success in relationships as an <type>   my patient who i just saw he told me he wants true love in his relationship with his partner like he saw with me and my husband and i see he has this now it is beautiful he also is so positive always working to keep positive and i am so grateful for that he sees what others do and appreciates everyone what a good example to me and others   
entp,just like the <type> thread   how do you look as a <type>    post picture of your <type> self and lets see if any patterns emerge or just be a narcissist and whore it up 
infp,i never gave much thought to the ways in which people manipulate i might have fall victim to it   without even realizing it i do n t think i feel any need to manipulate at all i might be wrong i might do it without being aware of it i guess i m a complete nitwit on the subject so   what are the ways in which people manipulate    how do <type>  s do it    do they feel less need to than other types    do <type>  s fall prey to this quicker than others    how do we protect ourselves from it

esfj,i have broken my ex gf <type> trust by saying break up i carelessly decided to break up with her too fast to decide she said she tried to move on suddenly i told her that but we still live together as i ask her if i still can live with her    because i still want to take care of her    and she s okay i asked her why we can t come back even she knows how i feel she said because i ve broken her trust the question is is it possible to rebuild trust    or how can i make this situation better    
istj,pretty self explanatory from the title explain the reasons behind your current mood and every time you change your mood as to why you have it you can share private things if you want or you can keep it vague hope to keep this thread alive for a long while this enables us to have a deep discussion about what  s going on in our life this way we get to know each other better as people and not just a collection of username   type   avatar and signature 
infj,this really eats at me sometimes i love people   yet i feel so disconnected from them it  s like everyone  s style of communication is a different language that i just ca n t speak or understand sometimes i try to listen to the conversations of other people   and it  s like they are speaking a different language i think a big reason why we feel like outsiders is that we crave only deep connections and deep conversations most people on earth have numerous shallow connections and a few deep connections with others   and carry many shallow and few deep conversations with others we simply cannot do surface level   which is the bread and butter of most communication in this world if you look at the three most common types   <type>   <type>   and <type>   they are either si dom or aux majority rules so most casual conversations typically revolve around discussing si where is si in an <type> function stack    yeah       dead last we want to talk about things our ni discovered or how people are doing with fe that  s usually way too deep for casual conversations we have no interest in discussing si   but it  s what the most common types talk about there  s nothing we <type>s can do about this it  s not something certain types did wrong   or something we did wrong it  s simply the result of being in the minority   and how we are built i hate feeling so disconnected i hate being in a room of dozens of people only to feel so disconnected like i m completely alone that i might as well be in another dimension we will always feel like this my advice    try your best to accept that you are different understand there is nothing wrong with you even then it  s difficult   because your probably like me   and you wish you could fit in and connect with others better even then   it  s still going to hurt feeling so different it  s even worse because of how perceptive we are   so we truly gasp how different we are compared to others much more then most people maybe if we work hard to find that one person we can have a strong close connection with   we would n t feel so sad

estj,i read about <type> fashion from socionic site it said <type>s clothes are mainly executive or classical in style men prefer the traditional suit and tie when choosing clothes <type>s will pay much more attention to comfort and quality than to the latest fashion female <type>s do not often wear extravagant things even if they do try to follow fashion their choices will always maintain an element of conservatism in general <type>s are very careful and cautious with their clothes their clothing is always neat and clean they may keep clothes for a long time and know well how to preserve them even if some items are quite old they still may look like new <type>s do not like untidiness and carelessness in their appearance and in general trousers are always ironed   shoes polished   etc click to expand my questions to you <type>s do you find this description somewhat true    what are your considerations in choosing clothes    what do you want to look like    how do you define your fashion style    show me some of your clothing fashion style 
enfj,how differently do <type> and <type> use their fe    theoretically extroverted feelers are labelled as being selfless in my case   i feel i am only selfless in order to protect myself i  d try to make others happy and make sure they have a good experience so i do n t feel their negative emotions in me i  d say <type> uses fe in a more proactive way while <type> uses it in a reactive way    theoretically fe is also labelled as being manipulative i think about this a lot as i am quite manipulative for example i  d be saying things with the purpose of making someone feel good about herself so she does n t get jealous of me it is almost a way showing to her hey i am not your enemy i pose no threat if it means i have to tell a little lie to compliment her arch or feet in a dance class   for the sake of a good experience we are both going to have   i do n t mind or never feel guilty about it my <type> girlfriend always calls me fake or a doormat but i do n t understand what it is wrong of creating harmony by telling a little harmless lie    
isfp,soo a couple years ago when my <type> friend sent me to take a personality type quiz after i was complaining to her about my job   i found out i was an <type> later on   i decided to take the test again   and i got <type> then did it again and got <type> this test gave a percentage of each and i think i was n t too much more se   but was just by a little this did make me question myself and who i fit under   but for sure i am a more creative   artsy person so i could say i am definitely <type> then the question of intuition has been coming into my mind   especially lately id say over the past couple years i  ve become more intuitive   thinking of the future   trying to plan and set goals i also did n t understand how i could be se dominant if i actually do think i tend to be intuitive then i came across this article a few weeks ago   which says that our   function is extroverted sensing   and   is introverted intuition it then says that we are quite balanced in our se and ni   even through ni is   this was like an aha   moment for me i more started to question it because i recently also came across the idea of highly sensitive people   and i thought that i was one i bought a book called the highly sensitive person and started to read it i just started   but in the first chapter it talks about how hsp are very intuitive people so i thought to myself   if i am considered se   then how can fit as an intuitive hsp well now i think its a little more clear to me i looked quickly into the number of <type>  s that are considered hsp   and it seems to be a low compared to other intuitive personality types id like to get some insight from my other <type>  s do any of you consider yourself to be highly sensitive    also   do you consider yourself to have a good dose of ni   where it can be balanced with your se    im new to diving more into personality types and hsp   so any insight would be great i also just started reading the book so i have no idea what else is in here i guess i just thought that all <type>s would be like me   highly sensitive lol this is interesting to me i am not the number one fan of labels in general   but these have helped me to understand myself better and why things have affected my life 
infj,hi   female <type> here i recently started doing online dating apps it started great at first but i had trouble connecting with men i m not sure if it was my problem or theirs i realized i m reluctant to bridge personal topics   so my conversational starters are often about their work   faith religion   or some intellectual discussions which i enjoy by the way i m also very serious   and not very upbeat and sweet and since most guys there do n t ask questions first   i subconsciously take the lead to keep the convo going but it never lasts long most of them end up not continuing the conversation and leaving on last reply which   if you are like me   is equal to a not interested and i m not really invested to push for it or i stop talking with them because i do n t feel the mutual interest to keep the conversation going since they do n t really try that much have you had similar experiences    
isfp,post your song here i ll start do you like this song    
isfp,might as well post this do n t be shy   here  s me in a confused state 
isfp,sometimes i learn something about the world   some new connection it links up in a way that makes it feel i  ve leveled up it usually happens when i explore some new system of knowledge and i realize how it connects to something i already understand it is like the floodgates are opened and i feel like a god or something i know this is a perfect example of jungian inflation where my weak ni gets overconfident and think i m smarter than anyone else still i m actually smarter as a byproduct of the realization   it really did level me up   but i overestimate how much smarter i got i  ve found that a good way to get my feet on the ground is trying to write the knowledge down in some document forcing myself to try to te out the insight really shows me how weak a grip i have on it it also makes me better at the thing i leveled up in   so it is all good   even if my ego feels fully deflated anyone else can relate to some of this    
esfj,you know you  re an <type> when    insert funny observations below    happy 
infp,so   i get ready for dayjob in the morning   wife says i m a grump and seem depressed after i pack it in the end of the day and get a few minutes decompression   she says i m the most joyful person she knows it  s a coping mechanism   flip a switch try not to think of interesting things    outside of breaks      work to pay the bills   end of the day flip switch back and can relax it is not completely seamless and there are bumps i  ll be out having fun   someone asks how work  s going   suddenly the world  s are colliding and my demeanor changes   and i try to avoid the subject a lot of people talk about their workday   i simply do n t   why relive it    it is the only way i can find to stay motivated   is i get to take off that label   that persona   at the end of the day and be who i want so   i know its not a perfect scenario by any means   but is compartmentalization in general healthy    and where did i crossed the line to it being sort of jekyll and hyde like    does anybody else do anything similar    
infp,so i  ve noticed that as <type>s we tend to be a bit negative   and especially put ourselves down so i  ve decided to create a happy thread   post something good that has happened to you today   a week ago     years ago whenever it can be something really huge   like you just got married   or something that may seem insignificant   like you found an old picture that made you smile it can also just be about anything that makes you happy in general i hope this thread can bring everyone  s spirits up   happy here  s my post today i got an email about volunteering as a latin teacher in south carolina over the summer   which i am really excited about i have an unhealthy love for all things classics   and i love working with kids so this is perfect for me it will also hopefully cure my restlessness from staying in one place for too long   bring on the happiness   everyone   
esfj,hello <type>s   in this interview   i got a chance to talk to all the exxj types about their shared experiences and what makes them different from one another during the interview   we talked about exxjs having trouble making a decision for themselves and needing permission from the tribe before making decisions we also talked about te shaming ti and fe shaming fi savannah asked an awesome question to the <type> and <type>s on how te  s can be more sensitive to ti  s and not offend them we also discussed what their ti or fi swing looks like when they go on a selfishness swing we also discussed racist jokes and how they perceived it as an exxj we also talked about blood and family ties and how the <type> and <type> perceived it differently from the <type> and <type> double observing was something we tried discussing but the topic was too boring for the exxjs to continue talking about because it  s so easy for them in the end   the exxjs had a message to say to fellow exxjs on how to better themselves as individuals some things i noticed about each participant include julia    <type> and our only info dominant exxj    did an amazing job maintaining the flow of the conversation being balanced with her si fe and ne ti maggie    our jumper <type>    was relatively quiet and focused on gathering the tribe  s perspective rob    our jumper <type> with double activated ti and token male exxj    was acting very exxp like with committing to decisions savannah    our jumper <type>    asked some very good questions to the lead fe  s nina    our jumper <type> and only lead nt    was doing a makeshift double decider which shows how present that masculine fi is at the bottom when double activated natalie    our <type> and only mf    produced many hilarious moments including before the interview with her blast to nina just seconds after learning something from julia and finally   heather shows the big difference between an <type> and <type> when it comes to dealing with presenting themselves to the tribe i also thought it was interesting that julia being info dominant was not as scared of how the tribe perceived her as the energy dominants were julia said she can clarify with the tribe which shows the easy flow of information while natalie said she never thought of asking the tribe and just assumed everyone hated her watch this interview here 
infp,i have been injured so badly with antipsychotics and the treatment i have been given by psychiatry that i can barely even speak the days when i was genuinely laughing   exploring the world at my own albeit very sluggish pace    later on    and feeling truly alive are so far gone now that it almost seems like they never happened   despite that they happened not that long ago i m not the first to wish that my linguistic skills would match up to the depth of the experience i am trying to communicate and i won t be the last   but my inability to actually say what s happened happening to me is immensely frustrating so since i can t spin a poetic or emotional yarn and explain myself that way   i ll just have to say that i can no longer think   feel anything but emptiness   restlessness and quiet despair and in general i am not in tune with my senses enough to enjoy them more or less   my mind has gone completely blank on antipsychotics i can no longer picture anything in my head that isn t severely distorted   and i have no natural running imagination like i used to once   i could lie down and entertain myself by allowing images to flow through my mind and by enjoying the feelings and thoughts that corresponded with them i seldom pictured things that made me uncomfortable now   this never happens at all and i have to struggle to picture my mother s face even when i do it comes out disgustingly distorted and bearing little resemblance to what she actually looks like furthermore   i can t speak to myself in my head i cannot even say the word hello to myself without moving muscles in my throat or changing my breathing that is   i have no internal voice when i concentrate on my mind   all i get is pitch blackness coupled with the physically generated effects of my retinas and such my mind makes no associations between things and in fact hardly generates thoughts about things at all what i can t understand is how the world in general has come not to realize how painful it really is to have no internal world whatsoever surely   i used to think   this must be an emergency of sorts how am i supposed to relate to others with no stimuli of my own    how am i supposed to do anything    how is this even considered to be alive    how is it humane at all to force this wretched state upon someone against their will with antipsychotics as it was forced upon me    surely i must have died   i also suffer from movement disorders i shuffle around a lot and constantly move my legs and feet most of the time i have no awareness that i am doing this but this to me is sort of a trifling issue i am much more agonized by the lack of content in my being simply put i add up to nothing   and i feel that i do i just don t understand how society can be so cruel like this people think instinctively that because i have schizophrenia   that i must be seeing things that i must have a life rich in experience if not in action the sad truth is the opposite i have no internal content and i don t see how i could ever operate this way my memories are also gone   for the most part   both long and short term i can t remember my past it s almost as if   as i ve said before   the good times in my life never happened i just don t know how i m supposed to continue this way suicide is a very tempting option since drugs like acid that could maybe reverse this are illegal honestly   i don t know if i should bother with that it might be more prudent just to end it for good i was afraid of being forced to take antipsychotics but i didn t know they could do this much damage this all goes without mentioning how worthless of a person i am to other people now please <type>s stay away from antipsychotics if there s even a small chance it could do to you what it did to me    and i believe there s a large one      it s not worth the risk 
isfp,as already pointed out in another forum   these should not be viewed to determine one  s type   but for information purposes only whether you agree with susan storm  s assessments or not   should not influence any from determining their best fit type as being <type>   you re extremely down to earth you take life as it comes and   according to typologists paul d tieger and barbara barron tieger   are the most unassuming and down to earth of all types    p      the art of speed reading people    you are very aware of the facts of life   and the reality of what is happening around you not much can rattle you because you tend to have a very grounded outlook   you show your affection through actions more than words you re typically not someone to verbalize a bunch of effusive praises to the people you love rather than whispering sweet nothings   you re more likely to shovel someone s snow or make them a mixtape your feelings   although deep   are very private and internally felt you tend to show your affection and love through acts of service and helpful gestures more than words of admiration   you are deeply affected by the pain or misfortune of others although you may seem mysterious and even stoic on the outside   you are deeply feeling on the inside you are tremendously affected by the pain   unhappiness   or trauma of others you instantly imagine how it must feel to be in their shoes this empathy tends to grow as you age and mature you might find yourself feeling intensely troubled   sensing a deep pain in your heart and a lump in your throat as you hear about the afflictions that others have experienced   you take a while to get to know you re not someone who immediately wears your heart on your sleeve you need to know that you can trust someone before you share your true feelings   your pain   or your tough experiences in life highly effusive   expressive people can be overwhelming to you and if they ask for a lot of details about your life it can make you feel anxious or even suspicious   you quickly notice what other people need because you are so observant and attentive to details   you are quick to notice when the people around you seem worried   stressed   cold   or uncomfortable in any way you re probably one of the first to offer a warm blanket to someone who is cold   or the first to go snuggle a pet that seems lonely or anxious for friendship   you try to hold space for people s unique differences it s crucial to you to be open minded to the experiences and worldviews of others while you hold strictly to your own beliefs   you also realize that everyone else is shaped by their unique life experiences you tend to be quietly accepting of others unless they are sharing beliefs that are condescending or harsh to your personal values   managing long range projects leaves you overwhelmed because you re more focused on the present than the future   it can be challenging for you to imagine how things are likely to play out projects that take a lot of focused   methodical attention and have a distant payout tend to be frustrating to you you like to get quick results and see an immediate result from what you are putting your energy into now   you are suspicious of sugarcoating and overly effusive behavior some people believe that feeling types want all their words wrapped up in words of praise   affirmation   or compliments for <type>s   this can actually be off putting these types like people who are straightforward and real with them authenticity and direct honesty are more important to them than cloying   sentimental words   you have a lot of aesthetic sense you notice the world around you in high definition detail details stand out blue isn t just blue   it s sapphire or egyptian blue or azure you notice what colors complement each other and enjoy perusing art museums or looking at different fashions to see which style best resembles you as an individual to you   colors   designs   clothing all of it can exemplify a part of your unique personality in a way that words just can t define    you crave creative freedom you enjoy toying with creative supplies and materials to come up with something completely unique you enjoy careers that allow you to be creative   whether that s through photography   marketing   cooking   hairstyling   performing   or many other avenues    you hate being rushed you weigh decisions for longer than most people   trying to understand the significance or value of each option in depth when people pressure you to make up your mind quickly   you feel irritable and resentful    you empathize with the underdog you are particularly drawn to oddballs   misfits   and misunderstood or marginalized people because of your individualistic nature   you appreciate people who march to the beat of their own drum    you re a closeted adrenaline junkie sure   you enjoy binge watching netflix and laboring over a creative project but there s also a side of you that is hungry for physical intensity and thrilling action whether you re rock climbing   dancing   or speeding past a slow driver you enjoy pushing yourself physically and getting a rush of independence and freedom as a result    you help people see options you have an eye for opportunities in the present moment   and you help people find resources and alternatives they may not have considered previously you tend to stay calm in a crisis and help people find creative ways out of difficult situations    you re drawn to the mysterious you enjoy spending time alone and imagining how the future could unfold conceptualizing new ways of seeing things can be very stimulating and energizing for you at the same time   you tend to distrust yourself when it comes to guessing how something will happen in the distant future when you re being creative your intuition really does shine   you enjoy doing creative projects where you can draw attention to mysterious or symbolic meanings    you hate rigid rules and structures you like being flexible and adapting to the needs of the moment rather than being stuck with guidelines that tie you down you feel like life is unpredictable   and as a result   it s better to be able to go with the flow rather than check in with your schedule to make sure everything is running according to a strict plan    you dislike giving negative feedback critiquing people is something that tends to send shivers up your spine you like to create an atmosphere of openness and quiet warmth   not an atmosphere of defensiveness and shame because of this   you tend to put off giving criticism or give it as gently as humanly possible    you think better when you re surrounded by beauty sitting in a stale cubicle is probably one of the worst ways for you to hand in your best work your creativity and focus blossom when you are surrounded by lush colors or ethereal landscapes you often work well outdoors   in the wilderness   or in an area that you ve made your own with beautiful details that inspire you    you crave independence nothing fills you with more joy than venturing out on your own to do something meaningful stepping onto an airplane   roaming around in your car   or taking a risk on a career that aligns with your values    even if it dismays your more traditional parents    fills you with a sense of purpose and peace you don t like being tied down to someone else s dreams   rules   or demands    you enjoy binge watching netflix when you re stressed okay   a lot of people do this   but your type especially enjoys television as a stress reliever    according to the mbti manual    when you ve had a bad day   you enjoy piling up some comfy pillows and blankets   gathering your favorite snacks   and having a marathon of your favorite shows    speaking of stress   you become more critical when you re burned out normally gentle and tolerant   when you re severely stressed   your personality can change unexpectedly you might blurt out sarcastic or critical comments at people who are bothering you or get caught up in rage fueled fantasies often you feel like everyone else is being lazy   inefficient   or incompetent you can find out more about your stress reaction here    schedules feel confining for you   bedtime is when you re tired   and mealtime is when you re hungry you follow your instincts as you go through your day rather than structuring everything out family rituals where you have to rush through plans and schedules with a lot of other people tend to exhaust you    you don t want to control others you hate the idea of invading anyone s space whether it be a human or an animal your live and let live mentality makes you a go to friend for people who need space and freedom you believe that every entity on this planet deserves personal freedom   respect   and a sense that their life is their own road to trailblaze    later in life you find more satisfaction in order if you re in your   s or   s   you ve probably reached a point where you can organize your tasks and projects more easily it s easy for you to lay out reasonable explanations for things and you can argue your points with veracity when you were younger   this was much more difficult for you 
estp,hello <type>s   in this interview   i got a chance to talk to all the exxp types about their differences and similarities during the discussion   we discussed what causes exxps to feel anxious and how that feeling manifests in their bodies we also talked about the exxp  s ixxj swing and what that looks like for each individual exxp type it turns out that exxps also do n t like chaos and like to control things in their life the only difference is when chaos happens or plans get ruined   the exxps can easily pivot to other plans or feel calm when chaos hits next   the exxps discuss their issues with over gathering and what that looks like based on their type this part of the discussion was interesting because each type tends to over gather something completely different ranging from physical objects to information to values we also touched on double observing or the lack of teaching doing after consuming new information this leads us talking to the differences between info dominant and energy dominant exxps we then touched on people problems as an exxp and what that looks like and finally   we discussed ti being annoyed at ti and fi being annoyed at fe and even fe being annoyed at fe panel members were jany    <type> se te pb c    s    ff      tiana    <type> se fi cs p    b    ff      shane    <type> se ti cp b    s    mm      ian    <type> se fe pc s    b    ff      jacob    <type> ne fe pc s    b    ff      jake    <type> ne ti cp s    b    mm      annie    <type> ne fi cs b    p    mf      ashli    <type> ne te pc b    s    fm    for the first hour and me    <type> ne te pb c    s    mf    for the second hour watch this interview here 
istp,i have an <type> villain on a harry potter roleplay how does the type of <type> effect the character  s actions as a bad guy    
isfj,alright   it  s high time for us to have this thread even the <type>  s are ahead of us   tongue i guess i  ll start i hope they are accurate enough you know you  re an <type> when you say something humorous to a person   then worries how that statement might have the hurt the other person   causing you to apologize to the bewilderment of the other you work on a project and finish it   but it  s not perfect enough   you get flustered when a person commands you to speak up angry even constructive criticism hurts frustrating you get attached to a person after around two weeks of getting to know each other   and when he she has to leave   you cry heavily 
isfj,how do you think <type>s would be in the military    personally   i think some <type> attributes may help us out in the context of the military i  ve never really wanted to do it   yet i have n t been totally against it    unless you go to war          plus   i was always pretty bad in gym class except in high school when it was an a for effort any <type>s from the military here or thinking about it    is it even an option or was it ever an option    
istp,hello everyone   sorry   y all it  s long and it  s full of <type>ness   hope you <type>s do n t get discouraged from reading laughing i m currently dating an <type> and i m an <type> type     we  ve only been dating for   months however   i feel incredibly one sided in this relationship i put a lot of effort    showing a lot of physical affection   words of affirmation   giving him gifts   etc      and when a problem arises for me   i try to communicate and find a common ground that makes both of us happy i feel like i m the only one putting any input into the problems   i  ll ask him what he thinks and he  ll say i do n t know i thought you guys were suppose to be fixers lol   he has an incredibly lazy and stoic demeanor and for the most part   i just assume he  s lazy because he never really does anything i propose   such as making any date plans to hang out with me in the future    i know you guys are known to be bad at this    but there will be many times he calls and ask to hang out and i m busy i find it incredibly selfish   he will just not ask for another day or anything and when i once felt i wanted to spontaneous and selfish and just showed up at his place without telling him and he said i was being inconsiderate    i agree   but literally do n t care   trying to be him for a day      and i get so tired being the initiator all the time   i just do n t even suggest an alternative anymore i feel like not a priority in his life   i feel taken advantaged of   and considering i m incredibly emotional   i feel emotionally starving and it  s been so unhealthy for me mentally   cause i m constantly trying to create turmoil to get attention because communicating does n t seem to work even when we talk about problems   he apparently does n t have any problem with me   but i have so many problems with him   but when we talk about it   he just never helps he listens   i know   but he does n t say anything and he does n t do anything to change anything i keep hearing you guys express it through action but he does n t really do much he  s pretty physically affectionate but i just think that ties in with sex he also sleeps alot when i m around   so quality time is n t really quality to me he occasionally smokes pot from what he says but i know potheads go to sleep alot but maybe it just depends on the person definitely does n t say anything romantic   i have to force it out of him by asking him do you like me like   times he will also hang out with his friends and get drunk alot   and will not text me all day night   it  s not the most important thing but it does make me feel undervalued in his priority list   considering everything else he has or well has n t done i get worried pretty easily   i  ve had alot of traumatic experiences with death of important people   so i really appreciate them updating me or at least telling me they  ll go mia he  s been better about it but i honestly dont think i have given this relationship enough time especially for an <type> i do n t know if i need to be more patient or just really cut this relationship   it  s been incredibly draining trying to carry his ass and leading this relationship   it  s like i m doing all the hardwork and he  s just behind me while i cut the obstacles in front of us also he  s incredibly broke   so we ca n t really go out and experience a lot of things so i try to pay from him once in a while but i felt so taken advantaged of   i just did n t feel good doing it anymore i  ve suggested to be fwb   see other people   instead of working towards a serious long term relationship or possibly an open relationship   so he does n t have to feel the pressure of what i expect in a relationship as much   but he  s highly against it and only wants us to see each other only i have no doubt he  s honest and faithful but it  s like he  s living a single lifestyle while wanting a girl with him without any obligations priorities responsibility of a partner it  s incredibly frustrating i give him a good amount of space cause i enjoy mines as well   but literally   if i do n t ask to hang out or just spontaneously do it   he will rarely ask how can this help maintain a healthy and exciting relationship       i also do n t know why he does n t just let me go   whenever i try to break up with him   he always sweet talks me into forgiving him and giving him another chance and resumes his unreliable and uncertain ways ugh   i just feel like we are so incredibly incompatible and my communication does n t get through to him and i m pretty direct i  ve asked people around me for their opinions and they all say to dump him because i deserve a lot better   but i think they  re biased cause they care for me so i want to see you <type>  s perspectives on his behaviors around me and i guess judge mines and what i can do better to accommodate to him but also be able to get more emotionally from an <type> i m not sure if i have anymore patience and literally just want to disappear and ignore his calls texts maybe just in spite of how i feel with him when he goes mia on me and leave the relationship at that i m really trying to save this relationship but it  s been really hard   he has n t proven to me that he  ll be a reliable partner in times of need   i mean he could just be too immature   he could also be too shy and needs lots of time to commit to that   he can also not be as interested enough to think it  s worth of an effort   etc he does n t even feel bad in this relationship and i am feeling like shit he fucks from time to time thoughts    maybe i just ca n t see the big picture or see the little changes that are happening    i have no fucking idea   i m confused   annoyed   and frustrated please and thank yous   other personality types are welcome to chime in too   
istp,long story short   i have a good friend who i  ve always typed as an <type> one day i made him do the mbti test    two separate ones    and he came up with <type> i was rather surprised   since i know they are very different from each other i have <type> friends   and they fit into the introverted   rather cold and detached <type> stereotype i used to have an <type> best friend who shows his affection by being available to hang out   do things together   and help me in practical ways i also have <type> friends    although not so close    so i know the general air of <type>s pretty well however i am unsure in this friend of mine did i mistype him or did he mistype himself    he  s pretty friendly and outgoing    the <type>s i know only hang out with certain people   and <type>s are more welcoming toward strangers    rather goofy around friends    <type>s i know are a lot more terse and solemn although they do crack jokes    likes to help people out whenever he can    even possibly sacrificing some important things    easily expresses emotions to close friends and especially romantic partners    he  s very vocal with love expressions and even pdas with a romantic partner    actually cries at sad movie scenes   and is often touched peace loving and rather soft hearted low self esteem   especially in relationships    <type>s i know have higher self esteem than <type>s    he could be an <type> he stays away from physical contact except with romantically interested people   he  s really good at technical things and solving technical problems he  s not much good at dealing with people   and he  s not so good intuiting what certain emotions mean    he ca n t read people well    but he tries his best to understand    possibly in a logical way    and is open to conversations if it can fix a problem    people or machines    i  ve seen <type>s not wanting attention and stick at a corner but will offer to lead if nobody wants to or throw themselves into the limelight just so they can offer solutions he does n t like to take charge   but will do so if he  s being given the role without being asked i  ve read somewhere that an <type> is more avoidant of problem solving   to quote it he will often not want to explain his thoughts clearly and coherently   then hang up on you if the conversation does n t go his way because they  re over sensitive about feelings and also because they  re fi he  s not like that   in fact he  s always eager to solve problems and likes to have talks also   <type>s are more indecisive    even on life goals and important decisions    than <type>s   and in this case he  s less wishy washy   and is often on the lookout for greener grass even though he  s pretty satisfied with life i guess i m just confused about the part where he is more emotional and altruistic than <type>s i know   which would point toward <type>   but yet again   <type> with their fi are n t that altruistic anyway i know <type>s are n t robotic   but they are n t as how do i put it feely as this friend    however this is only during casual situations   during work where he needs to act professional he  s almost     a stereotypical <type> thoughts    thanks
infp,i  ve been struggling with major depression on and off for the better part of   years now yesterday i had a particularly bad episode that came out of nowhere for no real reason even though i was surrounded by friends for thanksgiving   i felt utterly alone and aimless but then after i went home and checked my messages   i saw that my best friend from high school reached out about catching up we lost touch because we attended different universities and her family also moved away i  d forgotten that earlier i  d sent a message on our high school group chat about meeting for winter break and she must  ve seen it she asked me about italy it took me hours before i realized why it mattered   because i must  ve told her years ago only one or two times about studying abroad in italy i do n t post on social media and other people have frequently forgotten where i was but somehow she remembered it did n t matter that i spent thanksgiving with friends when i could barely register what was going on it did n t matter that the night before i went to a concert with friends who all seemed to enjoy it but it mattered that someone who knew me well from the rare times when i was n t depressed could keep track of something that was said offhandedly a long time ago and this might not have happened if i did n t send a message in that group chat this tiny realization helped me feel a little less invisible   and i hope this story can help anyone who  s been having a difficult time with mental illness 
enfj,the <type>s always have the coolest ideas lol http personalitycafe com <type> forum inspirers       portrait   words html list five words that describe you best i  ll start honest   genuine   funny   happy   deep
istj,i am placing these list from susan storm s website you should not use this list in an attempt to determine your type instead the list is being placed here for discussion among <type> types or compare list with other types that you may want to compare and contrast   you use your past as a guide for the future as you go through life   you consider it your moral obligation to learn from each experience   whether it s a failure or a success you collect these experiences and recall them when a crisis hits or a solution is needed to a problem that said   if you re in an unhealthy phase of life   you might get hooked on bad habits from your past enjoying the comfort or thrill of these habits and wanting to relive them even if they have negative consequences   you remember the facts and details of past experiences well you have a gift for remembering little details and experiences from the past because of this   you quickly notice changes and shifts for example   if you walk into a room   you might be the first to notice that the furniture has been rearranged you also might notice if someone s body language differs from their typical composure and sense that something isn t right   you crave a sense of routine unpredictable situations are anathema to you   so you try to have a clear direction for your day usually you have a calendar planned out and a daily flow that helps you to know what to expect and when this sense of routine and consistency puts you at ease and gives you the freedom to think clearly   you enjoy reliving your favorite memories all types enjoy reminiscing from time to time   but you seem to have a special affinity for it you can close your eyes and recall a past memory and feel as if you are really living and breathing it the past comes to life in vivid detail and lush imagery you can even enter a state of flow through this process find out more things you enjoy in    things that excite the <type> personality type   following through on your word is a huge priority for you because being consistent and dependable is so crucial to you   people know that they can depend on you to mean what you say and do what you say you ll do letting someone down or forgetting a responsibility makes you feel intense shame and frustration   you experience d j vu a lot because your memory for details and experiences is so remarkable   you quickly make connections between what is happening now and what happened in the past small similar experiences or sights can give you a sudden   unexpected feeling of d j vu people of your type frequently mention having this sensation on a regular basis   you post process experiences to enjoy them fully when you re experiencing something new you tend to feel a little detached from it as if experiencing the full weight of the present moment would be overwhelming however   after the experience is over you often replay it in your mind enjoying the beauty of it more after the fact than during which leads to our next point   you beat yourself up over past mistakes because you re always trying to learn from your mistakes and you have a tendency to post process experiences   you have a tendency to re play embarrassing or awkward moments in your head you might lie in bed at night beating yourself up over mistakes you made    or    years ago   feeling as if the shame and frustration of it all is happening in the present   you try to have a calm   composed manner loud   brash   over reactive people tend to annoy you you respect people who can maintain a sense of composure and control   even in trials and tribulations you try to maintain an air of professionalism and coolness in any situation that presents itself    you quickly sense changes in patterns because you re so aware of details   facts   and past experiences   you quickly notice unexpected changes or shifts in behavior this makes you keenly attuned to changes in patterns or inconsistencies in people    you get a strong sense of satisfaction from crossing items off your to do list productively minded   you get a thrill from crossing items off a task list you get a surge of joy from knowing your projects are being completed and you don t have to worry about them anymore    competence is crucial to you being competent and being surrounded by competent people is vital to your well being finishing tasks on time   being logical   and responding with a cool headed manner to any crisis gives you a sense of well being and confidence this can make you a highly respected leader    check out the <type> leader to see more about this       fairness and justice are core values of yours you hate preferential treatment and believe that solid rules and regulations should be applied to all people without bias that said   you believe clarifying the rules and making sure they are just   fair   and reasonable is crucial you will fight relentlessly to tear down rules you see as oppressive or unjust    you re skeptical of overt displays of emotion when people are emotionally reactive   cloying   or effusive   you tend to get suspicious what do they want    are they emotionally okay    can you trust them    why is their eye twitching    why are they crying    why can t they calm down       you re a realist more than an idealist you have core values that you strive to uphold no matter the odds but even with that in mind   you consider yourself a realist more than a dreamer you want to know the facts and avoid having your mind clouded by theories and emotions that might cloud your ability to see the reality of a situation clearly    be prepared   is your motto you create plans and contingency plans for the future so that no matter what happens you will have a solution readily available people count on you for your ability to organize and present alternative plans when a disaster occurs that said   if a situation comes up that you re unprepared for   you tend to feel trapped and overwhelmed you need to get away to a quiet place so that you can devise a solution    you re skilled in the art of logistics you seem to innately know how to organize people and objects in the most efficient way getting things done on time   getting people where they need to be   and handling many moving pieces is something you have the capability to do with nearly unmatched skill    you have perseverance if you put your energy into something   you see no virtue in bowing out before you ve given     of your energy to it you put a tremendous amount of willpower into every action you take    when you re stressed   you see dozens of negative possibilities normally focused and grounded   when you re severely stressed you tend to flip a switch and become filled with visions of doom and gloom you see all the ways that your plans could unravel and all the potential security risks that lie ahead of you    you despise pretention people who craft elaborate phrases with superfluous words tend to get on your nerves people who try to appear like philosophers   gurus   or experts without the life experience to back it up make your skin crawl    you put facts before personal feelings you ve made it a top priority to place truth on a higher level of respect than emotions your heart or feelings might be swaying you one way   but you know the facts are pointing in another direction except in really crucial situations   you ll follow the facts over the feelings in a situation    you hate the idea of compromising your values what few people know except those closest to you is that you have a deep set of unchangeable values you know what you believe to be right and wrong and you won t compromise that for anything you strive to stay true to your sense of integrity regardless of what the crowd is doing or what is popular at the moment    change makes you anxious you prioritize a carefully crafted routine that you can count on no matter what life throws at you you crave the familiar   the quiet   and the sense of continuity that comes from having a set schedule unexpected changes make you nervous and rattled    you hate clashing sensory details being in bright   chaotic environments or being around people who are wearing clashing patterns can make you feel uneasy and queasy you like the things around you to be organized   calm   and aesthetically pleasing when the details around you clash   you have an insatiable urge to fix them this can make you seem a little obsessive and nitpicky to people who don t share your tendencies 
estp,i experienced different types of you all just truly admire the woman who is a role model to me throughout my childhood   the friend that works hard for his single mother   the bully that pushes my limit   the teacher that taught me to grow   and the man i dated with whom fulfilled me    sadly taken and psychologically unstable    even the fictional characters that are my duals like perry miller   georgia   and oskar schindler    i do n t know why   i just find your heroic actions so enchanting 
entj,i met this <type> guy more than a year ago through an online dating app it was during pandemic and we  re fm diff countries we hit it off quickly and he said he was interested but i cldnt stand him taking too long to respond and missing our scheduled calls without notice i wld confront him and he  d apologize as an <type> i felt disrespected that he didnt take time to keep me posted and i needed more fluid interaction i politely ended it he was apologetic and told me that there had been so much going on in his life   renovating and selling his house to move to another state we reconnected two months ago and are getting really close i asked him so many times if he is really interested and can handle a long distance relationship and willing to fly to me   and every time i asked   he said yes but a part of me is still skeptical if he will keep his word he  s always busy but he texts me every day but doesnt initiate calls we wld video call sometimes but very seldom and i always had to request for it he said he  s not into calls much and promised it will be a lot better when we meet in person he said he stopped talking to other women when we reconnected and wld fly to me in a couple of months he told me he  s really blessed to have me in his life and wants to really build a relationship with me we think alike and have thesame core values and perspectives in life a part of me is still skeptical im catching deep feelings and im scared that he might be just stringing me along i dnt want to invest time and emotions on someone oversees who turns out to be not serious and wont keep his word i have the tendency to believe ppl easily for their words bec i am very honest myself and wldnt say anything i dnt mean and some ppl dont i get in trouble sometimes do some <type>s lie and string ppl along    i have no way of finding out since he  s too far no way to validate if he aint talking or seeing other women in his country i want to believe and trust him but i keeping myself fm expecting much coz im scared of getting hurt 
enfp,heard this recently say what you want about <type>s that we talk too much   or clown around too much   or can be irresponsible   self centered   careless but i do n t think i  ve ever met a mean <type> so we have that going for us
istj,i very specifically would love to hear from an <type> dad with an <type> son but i will take any combo of <type> parent to <type> kid my husband is an <type> and my almost    year old son is an <type> i thought <type> <type> was a hard combo to relate but i am learning <type> <type> is worse their brains operate in almost completely opposite ways and neither seem to be able to figure the other one out from my view   the biggest issues of relating are the following <type>s tend to be task masters and assume anyone not completing tasks    they think is useful    is not doing anything that is important while <type>s can spend hours daydreaming thinking    i am told it actually is what recharges them    <type>s tend to react well to being given a well laid out task list and can be motivated by guilt loyalty obligation to complete them while the more you push an <type>   the more they dig their heels   hate being managed and do better if they are given an end goal and left alone with a deadline to complete it   and are rarely motivated by guilt or obligation <type>s tend to assume that tasks and what needs to be done is obvious to others and that there is only one or two logical ways to do things while an <type> sees endless ways to do things    some more efficient than others    and rarely even notices some of the open ended tasks <type>s tend to not say much when things are running smoothly or things are being done correctly   but will be the first to comment when someone is doing something they deem wrong and they tend to be motivated to fix things if there is criticism for their work to an <type>   they respond better to positive reinforcement and tend to take criticism hard   even if it was not meant maliciously   and tend to shut down and give up rather than fix it anyway   my husband and my son just do n t get each other and i think it really needs to be addressed as he is hitting middle school high school my husband is not sure how to get him to understand he is not being mean but it  s at the point where the damage is done i was wondering if anyone has any sage advise that worked for them in relating to their kids

infj,hello   i am    and currently about to enter my third academic year at a university my major is english and   like most <type>s and many english majors   i keep flip flopping on what i would like to pursue career wise back in my seventh grade civics class which was taught by a spunky older southern lady who sang songs about the government and told stories of her adventures on the nude beaches of france i decided for a short period of time that i would like to become a lawyer now   after being convinced for years that i would become a literature professor   my mind keeps venturing back to the idea of a legal profession reading and writing will always be my passions   but something about the idea of teaching literature in a college setting does n t quite scream i m helping people enough for me now   i know what many people may be thinking most lawyers are just after the money   even if their work is unethical i am only interested in criminal law    and maybe environmental law   but i have little knowledge on the field      and i am only interested in becoming a district attorney that is   i would be working for the government to prosecute the criminals and fight for the victims it is the whole justice for victims notion that really grabs me this is the kind of law that i    think    i would feel good about doing of course   there are times where the defendant is actually innocent   which troubles me greatly however   i do not know how likely this is to happen   assuming that the district attorney  s office only takes on cases with a wealth of evidence i feel i have a knack for problem solving   a way with untangling words   a drive for doing right   and a persuasive presence under structured settings i have never heard of an <type> attorney   however   and i always second guess if i know what  s best for myself am i just unrealistically striving to be like marcia clark       who   i know   lost the case and was scrutinized for months but she still fought with everything in her for justice    will my feeling trait make me too susceptible to the harsh realities of law    any opinions on the matter of <type>s as prosecutors would be greatly appreciated   
estp,is the answer a yellow brick road far far away    and who is the mbti wizard who can grant me my heart
intj,from what i  ve gathered from certain people   this combo is n t possible because   is too impulsive and like to act first and then ask questions later whereas   <type> are careful thinkers who prefer to consider the consequences what do you think    
istj,all the types have such unique perspectives in our world i m curious about how the different types tend to experience travel so i m asking all you <type>s do you like traveling    why or why not    if so   how much how important is it to you    is it something you enjoy or something you make a point of getting as much as you can in       what sorts of things stick with you from traveling    certain people you met   the experience of being in a new culture on the whole   particular places   the art   the natural landscapes   etc    if you like traveling   what about it attracts you    do you tend to gravitate towards what aspects of travel    do you like it as a thrilling adventure or as a way to relax    are you drawn to places where you can experience more culture or more settings landscapes    lots of questions   answer whatever you  d like   and anything else you think of
intj,i feel stupid   ugly   or at the very least mediocre there are times when i skip class simply because i m not feeling attractive i m in deep pain i ca n t bear to accept the idea that i m not someone remarkable or exceptional the idea that i may never be relevant in the grand scheme of things it  s been putting me off doing a lot of things   from working on my songs to attending college classes my self esteem is devastated   nothing seems good enough for me i also no longer see the point in participating in college classes to have a mediocre job with a mediocre life i really want to grow in the musical and artistic field be someone inspiring and eccentric and disclose all my artistic potential of course   i m not going to stop doing these things completely   as i still believe in the possibility that i can create something beautiful and inspiring i will continue with all my remaining strength to aim at intellectual and artistic development but the fact that i am already    years old and still have n t done anything that relevant leaves me in a state of deep melancholy   since when i do   it will only be considered a   good job for my age     not   a work of a young prodigy with great potential   how can i get around this inconceivable desire to want to be something so phenomenal that is making me give up on life    does anyone have a point of view that might comfort me    am i just in some kind of addiction or mindless pursuit of admiration    or in terms of typology am i repressing my se or something    a ni fi loop perhaps    
istj,hello everyone   i turned    at the beginning of the month and it has been something like   years since i got my master degree and started to work on myself    lost    kilos   started going to gym   eating healthy   etc    i  ve recently got an redhat it certification and started to work on the second level as it would really allow me to get a better job income but i do n t know   i feel kinda lost those days like   maybe i m tired of working in addition of my job and my routine which is wake up breakfast job gym eat home work sleep    i still take some days where i watch some animes or play a little video game from time to time if i really do n t want to work    maybe i feel sort of burnt out and i have to admit that i do n t meet many people outside of my habitual friends   which are great and i like having fun times with them but i ca n t really talk computer things with them for example i should be happy that i passed my certification but i still feel somehow empty it  s true that i have n t got a deep conversation with someone for a long time and living in country side in a small village does n t really help if i m honest i do n t really know if it  s the cause or the consequence but i often feel like an alien an have low energy does it happen to you that sometimes   for whatever reason   you feel somehow hollow and empty while you already have many things    salary   car   investments   etc       i think i already know the answer which is to continue to fight and maybe try new things but i would like some outlook from others than my habitual social circle

enfp,over the years   my closest friends have tended to be <type>s   they are a type    i feel    i connect best with but i  ve realised a recurring trend which causes me angst     thoughts please   it seems to me that my <type>s    and <type>s    prefer to fill their lives with people in their immediate vicinity once they or i are living in a different city or country   it  s like i m off their radar   and they do n t tend to make any effort to maintain the friendship i come off feeling needy by trying to keep in touch i eventually get to the point where i feel that they mean more to me than i do to them   and i so stop trying but for me    <type>      when i invest in a friendship   it  s a long term investment i find it taxing making close friendships   but they are important to me   whether near or far any tips for maintaining long distance friendships with enfs    am i fighting a losing battle   or am i misinterpreting this    
entj,i have been wondering   of course <type>s can also show warmth and be empathic and compassionate but i think it may come across as different    someone   who says they are an <type>    though i have no idea if they typed themselves accurately   i do not know them well      said that they show empathy and compassion without the theaterics of emotions   they just can not be very emotionally expressive but they can still show it they would look at other people  s emotions with a more critical lens i imagine that <type>s may not be very expressive   which is why they can come across as cold but they can also be warmer towards a selective group of people they consider to be close to them or   you can also be empathic and compassionate without being warm it just can come across as cold to some people <type> and high emotional intelligence would also be a great combination what do you all think    
estj,so   most other forums has one like this   but i could n t find one here    think we  ll need one regarding all the stereotypes here    so guys    and girls      just go on and shoot any questions you  d like      other <type>s are welcome to answer as well of course   but i guess you do n t need an invitation for that    
esfp,never mind just delete this post   i overesmiated myself and no one would read such a long post 
esfj,i m just wondering why people pin <type>s down as being one of the most unbearable types because   personally   i do n t see anything about you guys  functions that would make you unlikable fe group oriented   like to make everyone feel welcome   empathetic   caring si remember little sensory details ne explores possibilities ti not so great at applying subjective logic    obviously   my description of the functions was extremely watered down   but even so   whats so offensive about that combination    i do n t get it 
enfp,here s for when i    or maybe you    need this thread please feel free to contribute 
entp,i do n t smoke   i m not interested in becoming addicted to nicotine but i ca n t lie   epipemods com these are cool   and the vapors smells good when i m around other people like candy i  d be tempted to get one of those pipes and nicotine free vaper juice if i were n t concerned about the toxicity of inhaling that stuff the vegetable glycerin and distilled water seem to be harmless enough and the p glycol or whatever is supposedly harmless as well since it is in asthma inhalers is this true    the flavorings though    even if the above is true   the flavorings seems to be a wild card because apparently there are foods that   when inhaled   cause damage like fake popcorn butter which is supposedly used in vaper cigarettes i do n t know any of you out there have experience in this    i love cotton candy   and if i could inhale it without making myself sick    hehehe    with one of those sick pipes    hehehe    also   do you have to inhale it into your lungs    could n t you just suck on it like a cigar seems like you should still be able to taste it if you keep it in your mouth   and that would be safer since the concern with some of these ingredients is not how they digest but how they affect the lungs edit just found a site that said vaping is more enjoyable if you do n t inhale but hold it in your mouth instead so ugh i might start vaping smoking nicotine free candy lol edit   just thinking   i live in cancer alley next to   oil refineries   a sugar refinery   close to a coffee plant   etc should i really be worried about the chemicals in an vaping device    
istp,okay   i m not one   but i m married to one and i find them intriguing and am curious what kind of lists you all would come up with and how much it would match him and the    few    other <type>s i know 
isfj, this is so long i am sorry i tried to be concise   but all the feelings see tl dr at the end i am a pretty true blue <type>    with some j tendencies in work environments      including the lovely ability to feel all the feelings and express none of them   especially when i may be slightly paranoid that expression of said feelings will not be well received or may do more harm than good i do n t worry so much about being judged for my choices or actions   but i do worry about how my feelings and their expression affect others and how they feel about me    if you  re wondering what makes <type>s hard to read that  s what it is    i have had relationships with men all over the mbti spectrum   but vast majority nf or nts   which also represent most of my friends so this whole sf thing is new territory i am now in a fairly new dating not yet committed relationship with a man i very strongly suspect is <type> he is a self described introvert and good listener   remembers details   has a lot of routines   is a dad and clearly has a very strong sense of duty toward his child    does very intentional and thoughtful things for him      has had the same stable job for over   years   stubborn   values tradition and close friendships   etc he was very forward and affectionate for the first couple of weeks dates    daily contact from the beginning      and we had a fantastic connection and chemistry with lots of shared values goals despite our very clearly opposite personality traits    which i can already see as complementary balancing      and then a tragedy in his close circle of friends required some shuffling uncertainty of dates during the third and fourth weeks   and he suddenly seemed quite distant   though at one point he in a frustrated but trying to stay teasing tone informed me that i should act like i liked him if i liked him i was confused   because i could tell he was being distant   though figured he surely was still interested if he wanted me to act interested   but could n t figure out why if that was true he was being distant in the first place   and then the distance persisted even as i reached out more finally   it all came to a head   and through a very direct conversation about feelings on both sides   i had the massive aha   moment when he said that he thought i cared   and because i cared   that i would reach out frequently to check on him after the tragedy struck   and then i did n t   and then when he told me to act like i liked him if i did and i in a moment of confusion and paralysis of fear on being asked to actually express emotion directly squeaked out something like i was trying to play it cool      i really like you   he was completely thrown off because he read that as game playing    rather than just my own insecurities    and so he had been acting distant because he felt distant and uncertain and oh i never explicitly thanked him for dinner    true story when i like someone my brain completely freaks out at the end of dates and i have no idea what i say and often realize like   days later that i did n t say thank you and feel terrible and embarassed but have always hoped that no one noticed    oof miscommunication central    meanwhile   in <type> girl land   i was trying not to come on too strong despite being totally smitten and trying to respect the fact that i  ve only known him for a couple weeks and so he probably does n t want me to be the person trying to reach out and support him because i care about him but i m not his girlfriend so i will just give him space to process the tragedy and let him show back up when he feels more stable and wait where is he       so after we have this conversation and figure out that both of our interpretations were just totally off    i care very much and thought i was being caring by not pushing him to communicate with someone he barely knows during a very personally sad time   he is distant because he is feeling hurt and unappreciated   not disinterested      i very timidly asked about moving forward and if these things are dealbreakers    and was certain he was going to be like   ugh   this is way too hard   no way   have a nice life      and he was like what    you  re great of course i want to see you again oh okay yay   so we  re moving forward   and have explicitly stated that our goals are simple   honest   and fun and that when i am feeling something   i will share it    which is   like   totally terrifying but also   you know   healthy    it was n t until after this conversation that i started hunting around for his mb type    he did n t know it when i asked him about it on our second date      and when i read the <type> description   literally everything about what had happened became so clear   and it was like there was a spotlight on all the ways i had acted exactly oppositely from what he would have interpreted as totally interested and caring    and why i misread his cues as well    the irony being    cue o henry    that if i had just openly expressed my feelings which   given my all or nothing nature   are typically considered a bit much by most and texted on the regular when i was genuinely thinking about him   and stopped panicking about what he thought about me so much i lost all my manners   the miscommunication would have been solved    he also could do with a little feeling sharing   but i know he thinks he was and he technically was it was just that i did n t get what the cause of the feeling was    one challenge i m going on vacation   and our schedules do n t line up this week   so we wo n t see each other for like     weeks    and the feelings conversation was by phone    which at first made me anxious   because i feel like we  re going to lose all this momentum   but instead i am trying to see it as an opportunity to build a better foundation therefore   i come humbly to you all to ask      does my overall interpretation of him as <type> seem accurate         we have not had a conversation about commitment   though i get the sense that what he would really like is what i might consider closer to girlfriend level communication   despite not having had that conversation    this is not an issue for me i am certainly not dating anyone else and fall heavily on the loyal   dedicated   and terrible at leaving bad relationships side of the <type>s   rather than the grass is greener syndrome and i think if we had seen each other this week next week   that conversation would happen once we actually had interaction beyond the feelings talk and both felt like the decision to move forward was the right one   just timing    but it still is counter to   like   the majority of dating advice to be constantly reaching out to a man who has n t made an explicit commitment    i actually said something like this to him that i did n t know him that well yet   to know what he would need in a time of personal tragedy   and that cultural wisdom was that you do n t smother a guy with interest in the beginning   and he was genuinely baffled at why i would ever   ever feel like i was overstepping my bounds or bothering him by reaching out to him   and that   really great dates was enough permission    do you crazy fools really mean it when you say you want to hear all the positive affirmation and confirmation buzzing around in my spastic brain    i mean when i really like someone it  s a lot      i do still feel like he is holding back and testing the waters a little   though it seems like expressing feelings is gasp actually working is that the case   if you  ve been hurt and feeling like you ca n t fully trust the other person to appreciate you not walk all over you    i mean   now that i understand why he was feeling that way   i totally get it   and i am happy to keep going with feels and affirmation and appreciativeness hell   i have whole lists stored up from the first few weeks   and basically getting begged to express them is kind of a dream but with consistency in that as we move forward   the trust will come     cause   you know   we <type>s like reciprocation example i had to be the one to reach out to verify plans or no plans for this week    we had been waiting for his schedule to be confirmed      which was frustrating because he had said he would let me know   but since he did respond and with a somewhat guarded expression of disappointment that he had an unescapable commitment    for his child    on the only night that would have worked   i expressed disappointment that our schedules were n t lining up to see each other before my vacation   and then he said something about me forgetting all about him since it would be so long   i said something reassuring and teasing   and he came back with ca n t wait to hear about the vacation it was like he was waiting to see if i was really going to follow through on my end before he started reciprocating interest again but it did make me feel like things were progressing in the right direction   after like a week of getting polite   pleasant   and positive but limited responses to my texts tl dr i think he is telling me that he means what he says and says what he means   and he likes hearing all my warm and fuzzy feelings about him all the time and if i m confused   i can ask   and he will tell me what is going on he says he  s simple   and that i am overcomplicating matters by worrying about how he will react to my natural instincts expressions of feeling   and to stop it and just talk to him this sounds too good to be true is it really that simple    are you all un smother able if you really like someone          assuming i allow some alone down time   which i absolutely have no issue with   as i need it   too oh   and not making   like   crazy big jumps into future talk because no    
istp,i  ve just collect a view feel free to post your idea
esfp,show us your favorite selfies or any pictures you want   post stolen by mot we all know you like to look at yourself p
estj,<type> here   i know this side of the forum is pretty much dead because <type>  s are most likely out working    hours a day   but i do want to say that i enjoy working with <type>s when i m home i m lazy as shit   but when i m at work i always want to be on my feet   i want to work   i want to get shit done and i work in a blue collar job   so we  re always outside doing heavy lifting   and i love it and it  s the <type>s that make sure all the shit gets done without <type>s at my job   it would take twice as long   it  s the truth the one big thing i have in common with you guys is that if there  s shit to be done   get it done   and anybody that wants to be lazy fuck  em   tell them to go home now as an n type i think there  s a better way to approach a situation like that instead of just saying get the hell out of here   but the concept is basically the same in social situations we are complete opposites and we  d probably get on each other  s nerves   but i respect anyone that knows how to work sometimes i wish i was an s   being an n gets exhausting   you have no idea overanalyzing everything   thinking deeply into everything   it  s insane but yeah i respect the hell out of you guys we do n t always get along   but i think there  s a certain mutual respect between the two types that  s pretty awesome 
istp,hey guys so i m pretty sure i m either an <type> or an <type> but i do n t know which of the two can anyone explain to me they key differences by providing some examples everywhere i look answers are given in a very theoretical matter which only confuses me thanks in advance also if you want to ask me something to help you determine which one i am   i m up for that if it  s of any help   the two results i get the most on enneagram are   and   and i can say that while   sounds a lot like my young teen self     is much more fitting for me now in my   s 
intp,well   i  ve seen these threads on about   different forums   so i guess i m stealing it from all those basically   post things that interest entertain you    not that kind of entertainment    i m confident that my fellow <type>s will come up with some interesting things i  ll start interesting mechanisms   this one  s used in watches for second hands   this one was used in aircraft engines before turbines   i do n t even know what this one  s for   this one  s used in sewing machines   this one  s called a constant velocity joint what    and finally   the wankel engine i do n t even really think this one  s physically possible so   <type>s   what turns you on    
intp,from all the stereotypes   this is what bugs me the most that <type>s hate celebrating their birthdays and they never tell when their birthday is i am not talking on behalf of all <type> right now   but on behalf of myself now i am already    y o and birthday celebration i ca n t remember when was the last one and no   it  s not because i do n t want to   but rather because no one even remembers about birthday anymore yes   family included and i get angry when on   th october    my birthday   feel free to wish me a happy birthday on that day    nobody comes   nobody even calls when i was a kid   my birthday parties were thrown every year and they were fun   now   there are only memories sad that  s my story anyway do you have any stories of your own    feel free to share 
esfp,during the school year i have been unofficially tutoring one of the elementary students that live in my neighborhood i  ve typed her as an <type> i could use some advice on discipline and or motivation in light of some recent problems for context   i am an <type> and am doing this in a friendly   neighborly kind of way sorry for the long post will highlight the key points so here are the issues academic she is now in the  th grade   but reads at the  st grade level    her parents do not speak english   so i suspect that in the early years a lack of attention to fundamental phonics has played a role    she cannot sound words out very well   and usually just guesses words based on whatever the first letter is    for example she would see the word basement and say basketball    english spelling is notoriously inconsistent   but hers is downright atrocious it pains me to see her ask for spelling to simple words like where she has very poor focus and usually cannot finish one question without going off on a tangent based on whatever random idea or memory has popped into her head i have resorted to using a timer to add pressure for her to keep working a worksheet that should take no more than    minutes takes nearly an hour and a half to complete she is a fun loving child   so i sometimes indulge her in her little side convos during reading comprehension multiple choice answers   she goes down the line guessing which answer may be correct   looking at my facial expression to gauge behavioral she is extremely sensitive to criticism and downright avoidant i offer praise whenever she tries and answers things correctly   but occasionally i will mention a systemic problem to her   and she becomes defensive she will do anything not to hear criticism   including suddenly needing a drink of water   needing to go to the bathroom   changing the subject   etc sometimes i let her do arts and crafts at my house she has become so entitled to my art supplies that she thinks she needs to leave my house with a gift every time she visits this includes her constantly asking can she have markers or cute knick knacks she finds around my home i have a pile of paper that i reserve for little drawings and random notes she asks if she can take two sheets home i say yes   minutes later she wants two more sheets it  s almost opportunistic   like she feels she has to constantly finagle more i have resorted to saying no more and more these days as i truly want her to understand that just because something is cute   does not mean that you are entitled to it she is a sweet girl   really values her friendships and playing she never runs out of energy to play the problem is   no matter how much i give   it  s never enough recently she asked if she could come over my house every day after school   and on the days that i am busy if i can call her and tell her that i have something else to do and let her know what is the something else woops   she    and possibly her parents at this point    are stepping into dangerous territory i m a freedom loving <type>   i do n t feel a need to be busy just the simple fact that i am an unpaid volunteer and she is not my child is enough for me to pump the brakes on that i do n t care if i have no plans at all i would never willingly schedule away my personal time every weeknight for the entire school year furthermore   she takes this kind of social rejection personally and starts to feel unloved in this case   i will notice her retaliating by acting cold or playing dumb while saying intentionally hurtful things this post has gotten long now   but if anyone has any ideas   tips   or tricks about any part of it   please let me know i feel myself growing resentful   which is n t a good relationship dynamic for a child if she were an adult   i would start my <type> slow fade   but she is very young and i think some behaviors can be corrected with insight 
esfj,okay how are <type>  s attractive to <type>  s    or would <type>  s be more attractive    why       <type> men and <type> <type> women    
istp,as the title says enneagram   vs   in the <type> the more ive thought abut this   the more ive seen too many commonalities between the two because of this   ive found it hard to type myself so id like to ask all of you a few questions which is more common in your opinion       on this i will likely counter argue    how would you distinguish between the two    and how has your view on this changed over time    
istp,has anyone here ever started their own successful business   and could share some insights       definition of success in this scenario would be making enough money to be self sufficient    i have been thinking about starting my own business for a long time now i know there would be particular struggles for the <type> personality   but i feel like the pros would outweigh the cons pros you are your own boss   which means nobody breathing down your neck and micro managing you you get to choose the work you do and the clients you take on    within reason    you can make your own hours and take holidays when you like    this can be tricky if you start getting busy and have a backlog of work however   given enough notice   i m sure clients would understand after all   everyone needs time away    you are in full control of the marketing   prices   accounting bookkeeping   scope of work   etc when growing   you get to choose who to hire to work in your business cons no job security will be tough sledding until you get a few clients and find some momentum    some people are n t comfortable with this   but i think <type> is well suited to this unpredictability    a lot of work hours    although most would see this as a con   i find this intriguing if you  re doing meaningful work    liabilities that come with running a business    threat of being sued   bad customers   online complaints bad reviews   etc    i  ve worked in the corporate world now for    yrs at several different companies   and i feel like it  s mostly designed for extroverted types who can do endless amounts of people pleasing and managerial ass kissing the exception would be if you could specialize in one particular area and be the best at what you do however   i have a thirst for various experiences and a dynamic   ever changing environment i have many more thoughts on the topic   and look forward to engaging with some of you humans on the matter   
infj,i feel like my case is clear to be an <type> seems like to be the ultimate way to be down to earth and not dwell on senseless shores as my intuition suggests i admire <type>s to the core sweet hearted   a helping hand by nurture is in their nature i as an <type> do not seems as humble as them i have strong opinions that lead to nowhere i am daydreaming all day long stuffed with irrational fears and nowhere to go in my heart i am asking question   knowing they are pointless <type>s do not feel so lonely   because they are satisfied with little from the start our ni function is our very own doom it is an consciousness that is always aware it has become more aware of the awareness itself <type>s are more part of the world   in the world they experience the human experience in simplest of terms they take action in purer forms   while my actions are layered in semantics   in intentions   in meaning i do n t know how to explain but xsfjs are blessed they do not look behind every curtain   every leave i look at their faces and a sadness of a life i want to live overcomes me <type>s just know too much i am an alien   but they are human i just want to be normal i want to forget everything 
infp,hello   fellow <type>s   i know this is not the first time this topic has been discussed here    or in reddit   for that matter    however   whenever i read <type>s discussions about moving abroad   i don t seem to click with the sheer excitement that seems to prevail there this is my situation i m considering moving abroad and it plainly scares the out of me for thousands of reasons   and   i must say   i m surprised it doesn t seem to be the case for most other <type>s let me expand on this   first in connection to being an <type> and then regarding some facts of my own life   because i d really love    and perhaps need    to get your honest feedback so   first of all   here we are   <type>s we are intellectually curious   unbiased towards other cultures   poetic and seeking for deep meaning and fulfilment travelling might be our essence   in a way on the other hand   we are also slow to develop bonds with people   need privacy and a cozy space of our own   and   if i m not mistaken   some sort of stability too for a start   the lack of these things when moving abroad terrifies me no need to expand on the emotional bonds about the rest of the issues   let me just say that living on my own has proved to be hard enough to achieve in my home country and it doesn t seem to happen that quite easily when you re an immigrant    and   in my case   don t come from a well off family either    as to finding deep meaning on the road   i tend to think about it as a double edged sword   since the realist in me also wonders how much of your supposed enlightening time you will have to spend simply trying to make ends meet in an unfamiliar environment has any of you had second thoughts on moving abroad for any of these reasons    if so   how did it all turn out    some additional considerations about myself    possibly relatable to other <type>s too    much as i love outward trips   rucksacks and everything   i ve found that they can be magnificent or trivial all the way inward trips   however   seem less risky and more satisfying to me for example   i could be more devoted to writing or other personal pursuits if i want a change in my life my parents are    years old and my brother lives abroad too duty and guilt   anyone    finally   i haven t stated why i m considering moving abroad the way i ve written so far   it seems it s more of an impossition to me   when it s actually not i d love to have an adventure   study or work abroad i m ok with my job in my home country but growing slowly uninterested   mainly because i m an english teacher for businesspeople and   i have to say   i m pretty fed up with having to put up with sexist   classist and racist comments whenever i open up a friendly discussion in class    anyway   this seems to be a global trend   but i keep fantasizing that i may find a nicer idiosincracy somewhere    also   the work market is growing worse and worse in my country    but then again   isn t it more difficult for humans to get good jobs when every day there s a new machine that sort of replaces us    i dunno    sorry about the length   pals i m all ears p s in case you re wondering   new zealand is the place i have in mind when i talk about moving   especially because of the nature there   because i speak english and because two of my friends may be moving there too   which really means something to me   since i m so scared to kickstart this thing on my own believe it or not   otherwise i ve always been very independent   but this moving abroad thing feels overwhelming to do with little money and on my own 
infp,it  s a bit shocking to me how rapidly and meaningfully public discourse has changed in the past couple of years regarding unidentified objects in the sky with the revelation of programs like aatip in the u s and military sensor data being released into the public while it  s still unclear what we  re seeing in the sky it has become increasingly clear that there is something actually being seen   it  s no longer hillbillies and stories now it  s military officers and civilian pilots with recordings on advanced sensor systems we  ve even seen the former head of the israeli space agency come forward with some albeit fantastical tales   but i m stumped as to what would motivate him to lie about this why would someone who spent decades as a decorated military officer and subsequent architect and leader of their nations space program burn their legacy to the ground    though i  ll acknowledge that his assertions are really hard to accept now we even have mainstream news treating the subject with some degree of seriousness for the first time since the sixties this was released just today i think i have no idea what the ship recorded   but it was n t swamp gas or a weather balloon   and if it is a drone who is making drones with technology decades or more in advance of the best the world has to offer    what are we seeing    and why has a government who has spent decades stifling an issue now reversed course entirely    thoughts    
enfj,i know we  re camera shy around here i m a little concerned that this thread will go nowhere lol however   it seems like most of the other forums have one of these   so i figured i  d give it a try post if you  d like   me   view attachment       view attachment       view attachment       view attachment       view attachment       me and my <type> friend that  s the biggest smile he can muster my name in candles is proof that an <type> can be romantic 
enfj,welcome   this is the definitive ask <type>s about relationship advice regarding <type>s thread here   we <type>s will do our best to listen to all your posts about potential <type>s and your relationship problems or questions you might have and answer them as best we can so just start by leaving your stories here   and give them a title    there is a little title bar when you click under go advanced in the reply section    so that we can help distinguish between new stories and old ones for other people who might need <type> relationship advice as well we  ll be looking forward to helping you guys as best we can   disclaimer thanks a bunch to dulcinea for this dulcinea said if you guys do n t mind   i  d like to mention a few disclaimers to anyone who would post a question okay first of all    and i see this mentioned a lot      are you sure this person is an <type>    i know something i  ve been seeing jawz mention a lot lately is that other types such as <type>  s   <type>s   <type>s   and   i think   <type>s get mistyped as <type>s often also   just because a person is an <type> do n t expect them to somehow have more insight into your <type> than you do if you  re in a relationship with a person   you  re going to see a lot of the aspects to that person that would motivate them in the things they do just as much as they  re jungian type or mbti a person  s mbti is limited in what it can explain about a person   and there are so many different aspects to a person than just    dimensions kc tan mentioned in his answer a couple of factors such as enneagram    a type   w   <type> might respond totally differently from a type  w  or type  w  <type>    and also culture i find the gender of a person makes a difference   sexual orientation   and also upbringing i  ve never actually seen it brought up too much in perc   but i would imagine the personalities on one  s parents might have a bearing on how a person views a relationship   particularly when dealing with a particular type also   it  s not a good idea to treat the responses to a started thread like it  s the oracle of delphi i mean   even if every <type> on the thread says i would do this   this   this and this to a particular situation   it does n t necessarily mean that  s how your <type> will respond i find it  s good to take everything stated with a grain of salt click to expand 
intp,i am an <type> who has recently become deeply acquainted with an <type> i met him on bumble a little over a month ago while he was passing through my town we did n t get a chance to meet in person and have instigated a long distance connection and ongoing conversation we speak over text and voice memo daily   for hours i am confused about our dynamic and am seeking feedback your personal or observed experience on a    signs that an <type> is developing or has a romantic interest in someone vs experiencing a platonic connection and b    your experience as an <type> if someone shared they had feelings for you and you did n t return those feelings    if it turned you off to a friendship entirely or if you were able to maintain a friendship after this    some contextual information i find this person mesmerizing i appreciate his mind   the way he assesses and analyzes things   his thoughtfulness   creativity   depth and sensitivity he is   frankly   brilliant and amazing he speaks to me constantly   all day for hours   asking me questions   engaging in deep intellectual conversations   expressing that he appreciates my intelligence and brilliance he even compared me to einstein    a compliment i am not sure i am deserving of   but which felt really nice   ha    it feels wonderful to connect with someone in such a deep manner and to be appreciated myself as more than just a dreamer and feeler    i do have a keen intellect and it is rare i can meet someone who is capable of probing the depths of the universe and psyche in a way that is satisfying and inspiring to me    i find myself developing feelings for this person and want to tread carefully i do not want to get hurt and wonder if my affections are one sided i value this relationship and do not wish to potentially ruin it i have a sense he is deeply shy and he has shared he is on the spectrum    i am as well    i do not wish to scare him away and potentially make things awkward if he does n t share the same feelings or if he views this relationship as merely a deep platonic friendship i have sought to be clear   stating that i like him and often reflecting how much i appreciate him   our connection   and that he makes my life better his responses to these sorts of statements are often reflective    i e   i appreciate you also   i feel the same   or i find our sharing immensely rich   meaningful   and valuable    and logical sometimes   his responses are also disappointing    i e   ditto    while these sorts of emotional statements are interspersed occasionally   the general tone of our conversations is usually intellectual   creative   and abstract i am confused by some statements he has made once   he suggested we are a soul connection and stated he determined his intuition to visit my city was prompted by a cosmic call to meet me and connect with me he then immediately followed this up with an explanation from quantum physics on gravity and frequency dynamics   which makes it decidedly less romantic and unclear if he was flirting or just stating a scientific fact i can agree scientifically with the logic behind the statement   but it makes it confusing to know if he likes me or just views this as a deep connection governed by numinous universal properties    ha    i also shared with him that i liked him and he did not respond to this   instead following up a few days later with a statement that he believes we are in a supra sexual relationship    i e   a co creative relationship that is of a higher order   with creative and evolutionary purpose and potential rather than simple pro creative biological potential    this could be either a display of affection or simply a factual statement of his experience of a deep platonic connection i have also asked twice    about a month ago    if he wanted to talk over facetime   phone   or zoom and he did not respond to this   but recently asked me if i wanted to test a scientific protocol over zoom this confused me i do n t understand why he would be open to a scientific test but not a conversation    so   there are somewhat mixed messages and i am confused these is significant time investment being placed in this connection with me   he makes occasional statements reflecting his experience of a deep connection and appreciation for me   and states that he thinks of me and dreams about me however   i experience a lack of clarity about how he feels about me and what he wants from this relationship or connection any thoughts or feedback you might have to offer is much appreciated i am on the spectrum and miss cues sometimes he is different from any other man i have met   which i really love   but this also feels unfamiliar and i do not have a template for which to nest this sort of experience inside of   which is why i am asking for some help thank you
