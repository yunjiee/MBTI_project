intp,"i feel i ' m too idealistic to be an type but too detached of my own emotions to be an type . )is there anything that may affect the way you answer the questions ? for example , a stressful time , mental illness , medications , special life circumstances ? other useful information includes sex , age , and current state of mind .i amyears old , female . i do have social anxiety , generalized anxiety , body dysmorphia and depression. )what kind of person are you and why ?that' s a hard question , honestly i feel like i don' t know myself that much . i ' m a chill person , i get bored easily so you have me changing from one hobby to another , but at the same time i ' m quite obsessive with the things i like , at least for some time . i' d say i ' m pretty sensitive to other people' s opinions but at some extent depending on the context i can avoid those feelings . it' s hard to explain . . )what about your personality most distinguishes you from everyone else ?how chill and careless i can be , maybe that i ' m very open minded so i can see things from different points of view . . )do you think there are any differences between how you described yourself and how people actually perceive you ? how do you think others would describe you ? if there are any discrepancies between these two that you are aware of do you know why exactly that is ?honestly i ' m relying a lot in the way i think other people perceive me to describe myself . major differences might be my opinions about certain things since i ' m quite agreeable to avoid conflict , also i don' t show that much that obsessive side about certain topics to people , since i don' t want them to find me weird . it really depends on the person i am with , but this is me when i ' m people i feel comfortable around . some people might perceive me as dumb xd , not that i ' m smart but i don' t think i ' m particularly dumb either . this is probably due to my careless attitude about certain things( bc of my anxiety and low self esteem ), the fact that i might be seen as someone without opinions or criteria and very indecisive . for example , when someone gives their opinion and i don' t agree i point out things i can understand or agree with at some extent , instead on fully formulating my opinion . . )describe your relationship to order and chaos . what do order and chaos mean to you ? how do they manifest in your daily life ?well , i' ll interpret this as chaos disorganization , tense or unexpected situations , random things . order organization , comfort , stability . they' re both very important for me , i like chaos( not extremely or necessarily negative )because otherwise i can get bored , all of my daydreams have chaos and troublesome situations but that' s what makes them better . i ' m a very disorganized person in a lot of ways , but i do want stability in my social life( at some extent )and not being anxious or stressed most of the time . in my day to day i avoid most stressful situations . . )do you see ideas as revolving around core concepts or as gateways to new ideas ?a bit of both , it' s hmm , stressful . for example , when i' ve tried learning to draw when i start studying a concept i see it related to a lot of other things which make me feel frustrated , it' s a lot of non specific information that i need it to make sense for me to keep going . when i idealize something i can see it as new gateways to great things , but once i start analyzing it it' s chaoting and maybe more complex that it should be . . )do you find yourself to be obsessive about topics ? do you continually divine value from something you already understand or do you move on once you feel you have a fair enough understanding ?i move on once i get bored of it or feel bad about it( like when i feel i can' t learn that topic ). i get obsessed about things very often and i leave them once i find something more interesting . when i have fair enough understanding i start going deeper and deeper into that information and start to discuss things . . )what do you like about traveling and what would you do if you could travel anywhere ?i like the feeling of being in a place i ' m not familiar with , that' s a vague explanation but i like to see the differences between people , climate , culture , places . if i could travel anywhere i' d probably go to an asian country since they' re probably the most different to my culture . . )what is it that you desire in life ? what do you strive to achieve ? why ? where do you think these drives and desires stem from or are inspired by ?autonomy , freedom and peace of mind . they' re related to each other but regardless of specific things , those are the feelings i wanna achieve . i want to be able to stand up for myself and the people i care about . i ' m not inspired by someone but i get my motivation from my family , and maybe what i picture would be a nice future . . )what type do you think you are ? why thisthese type ( s )? is there a type that appeals to you , to your selfperception , that you would like to be ? why ?at this point i have no idea . i' ve took several tests and a big part of my results were type , i' ve gotten type but i don' t know about fi since i think i ' m quite unaware of my own emotions . i got type some time ago and it made me question , in theory mbti is about functions but the fact that im very introverted makes it difficult . i' d appreciate any response , it' s a long text lol , sorry about that . you can ask me something in case i didn' t explain myself correctly . pic of my last sarkinova results , i don' t know how accurate they are but i hope it adds something."
entj,how often can people leave you without words ? how do you feel when it happens?
istj,"hi , i believe myself to be an type . i am curious if my sensor counterparts enjoy games more than types . the duty fulfillers may not sound like gamers , but neither do the scientists and i used to play a lot of video games . if you like video games , describe what kind you like . when it comes to gameplay mechanics , i definitely enjoy more freedom of movement . if a game doesn' t have acrobatics , then it' s an automatic minus from me . the just cause series is an example of a game series with a lot of acrobatics . i also like platformers and games with parkour engines . a couple of games with parkour engines are dying light and mirror' s edge . i do not like try the same challenges more than once and so , rpgs and openworld games appeal to me . i imagine that js appreciate challenge more than ps , but i prefer to have fun with games and see where destiny takes me . with games like grand theft auto v , i usually only do a tiny portion of the story mode and spend most of my game time doing random stuff . thus , i do not like games with long , linear storylines because they take away from the openworld aspects . now , for something people generally ignore when they talk about games . atmosphere . the music , the storyline , events in the game , and the appearance of the surroundings come together to form something that people later mistake for simple nostalgia . i tend to place a lot of emphasis on this because when there is a heavy atmosphere , i feel immersed in the game . i forget about my surroundings and it feels like i ' m actually there in the game . it' s good for when you want to escape from daytoday life , and that is something important . zelda games are usually very atmospheric , and i believe games like dark souls and bloodborne are too , although i have never played them . one game that is almost purely atmosphere is layers of fear , which i did play . and now for replay value . the difference between spendingfor an hour of gameplay and. for an hour of gameplay is how long a purchased game continues to entertain you . it is hard to determine which games are innately high in this because it' s largely subjective , not to mention highquality games are played more than lowquality ones . games that have a lot of linearity and puzzles( the kind that you know the answer to after you beat a game once )are lower in replay value , and games with large world maps , plenty of action , plenty of features , and good atmospheres are higher in replay value . elder scrolls games are known for keeping people entertained for long periods of time . lastly , the type of game . i mentioned a lot of actionadventure games , but there are also different genres . racing games generally do not have much capacity for atmosphere and variety , but one example of a racing game series with a lot of variety is the mario kart series . i did not play many games that are purely puzzle , so i don' t have an opinion of them . i dislike strategy games because there is plenty of stuff to think about outside of video games , even too much . i play games a lot more scarcely than before , mostly because i don' t like many modern games . modern game companies focus on graphics because graphics are an easy way to impress most people into buying a game . it is harder to advertise good gameplay and atmosphere , and advertising graphics instead yields a huge difference in sales . when this happened , i am not sure , but if i were to guess , it may have been around. there were many good games right before this , but during this time , things seemed to start taking a gradual downward turn . oh yeah , and i don' t play games that often anymore due to this . i don' t even bother buying consoles anymore because what' s the point if i will only like a few games for modern consoles ? not to mention the drm for xbox one and playstation, which i am surprised people put up with . there are barely any split screen games for those consoles either . almost everything is online , graphicbased , unimaginative , boring . so , do you play video games , how often , and what kind of video games do you enjoy?"

"
entj,"help me make some sense of this mess . okay ,months ago i met a man with whom i had incredible chemistry with . no doubt , an intense type . i am an type with traditional family values and have a preference for taking on gender roles . best description would be mindmate , we couldn' t take our eyes off each other during hours of intense conversation . he is smarter than me and the sexiest man i have ever met in my life . he clearly showed interest . i got him so riled up that i know he wanted to jump across the desk and rip my clothes off , as i was pushing his buttons and questioning his competency as a detective at the same time rousing his interest . it felt like he was interviewing me as a potential wife . i am trying to get a divorce , and he knows as he asked me to reclarify how serious i was about that at the time . and you do want a divorce right ? , which was way off topic of why i was there( trying to find a missing person ). he was asking me serious questions about my marriage and how i lived my life , and who was all in my life . we are having communication problems at current . i feel like he is making decisions without me and expecting me to catch up and get it all by myself !i keep going backandforth from being certain he wants me to disbelief . this man files for divorce within weeks of meeting me . but i don' t want to assume it had anything to do with me , and he hasn' t told me directly the reason . he isyears older than me . no children and i sense that he wants them . he adores my daughter . he is, so i think that he knows he needs to move now if he wants to start a family . he is already moving at the top of his department but most of the time getting chief of police means you have to show the community and others you are familyoriented . i believe starting a family is vital to his longterm career goals . in our first meeting , i got the impression that he made a decision about us on the spot , before he knew much about me . i think he based the decision on me being comfortable with being a sahm , that i take my mothering responsibilities seriously . he made a snarky remark once about his wife not being at home with his nephew and niece . while we connected on an intellectual level , i sense that he' s most attracted to the idea of locking me in his house , giving him sex , food , and babies . he has traditional views and made it clear his wife wasn' t traditional . he is confusing me and i actually cannot be for sure he has interest . he goes from offering to help me and spending hours at a time doing so to totally ignoring most my texts . but i am married he hasn' t been direct enough for me and i don' t want to cross the line myself . i think that he put a gps on my car not long after we met . i think that he may have done it mainly to see if i would visit a lawyer . he files for divorce himself taking the risk that i may not be serious about something with him . i think he has put his foot down and has refused to move forward until i show him by that i will take the same risk he did . what do you guys think ? how likely is this ? i will note that i run into him at walmart days after we met . a fully packed christmas shopping crowd and he had only a box of tissues in his hand , with his cop flipphone to his ear , moving quickly through the girl clothing section as if he were looking for someone . he didn' t seem surprised to see me and didn' t try to stop me , although he knew i had just gotten out of the hospital . doesn' t that sound like an type working on a goal ? i think this partner was attaching a gps and , being fully competent , he knew how to do this and his goal was to find me so he could give the partner go ahead . attaching a gps to a love interest would be easy for him , he' s accustomed to doing it to suspects and already had what he needed at hand . do you guys think he would do this , as there was clear interest in the beginning ? i feel like he has put his foot down because he hasn' t saw me visit a lawyer . we haven' t crossed lines as far as being too direct with each other and we' ve both tried to keep it friendly . he is a little possessive , asking me if anyone in the department had tried to hit on me before , what men i knew there , and when he caught another guy looking at me with interest i saw him stop what he was doing and ask me if i knew him( growling about it ). i caught him checking out my ass and he throws little things out there , like telling me he' s hungry and smiling . he has made moves that make me certain he is interested , but he is annoyed with me this past month and i cannot figure out why . he has ignored my lasttexts . the only thing i can think of is he is annoyed i am being slow about getting my own divorce( which is more difficult for me to do ). but how would he know what i have and haven' t done if there isn' t gps on my car ? i will note that i run into his partner while at a hotelmiles awayweeks ago , the partner also happens to go to the same fricking fine dining restaurant as we did , and he stared at me the whole time i ate . i only know what his partner looks like from looking it up online , he isn' t aware i could spot him . my mind is getting blown . can any type' s or other' s give me insight into what this man is thinking ? and , yes , i want this man . badly . but he is now ignoring my texts . i can' t be sure he has put a gps on me . is such stalking behaviors typical of the type when deciding on a longterm partner ? are they the most likely type to do this ? he' s pretty bold . maybe he changed his mind about me ? what is going on ? he doesn' t like my husband at all . he can' t stand him . my husband told him something about how all cops shouldcould die for all he cared and my husband kept stepping on his toes( exploding in a rage at the department lobby and going behind his back doing something he told him not to ). they have hadencounters where they almost got into a fist fight but he didn' t arrest him when he could have . they were like two bulls sizing each other up . my husband has no clue he has been helping me with some things . i think he wants to get my husband back for what he said to him about cops getting killed , as this man has buried many brothers . what are the chances he has changed his mind about trying something with me ? has my hesitancy to file for divorce myself turned him off ? i may note that he knows how difficult it will be to get away from my husband and i am afraid he will hurt me for leaving him , i have no money or a job and no social support , so it' s more difficult to file like he did . and i can' t even be sure his own filing for divorce had anything to do with me . i am type and need to be told things directly . the uncertainty and just craziness of all this makes me uncomfortable . only crazy people think someone is stalking them by gps !

intp,"hello , i have been a bit distressed because of my love life and i would love to know other type guys take on it . i want to specify that my story is particularly tricky . basically , i am an type woman that has been in a relationship for a long time with a guy . and few months ago , i met an type guy and we started chatting everyday for a few months . during these few months , i became quite anxious because i didn' t know what to think of my current relationship but also of this new guy . i know it can be a bit tricky to want to figure out what he wants when i dont even know what i want but long story short i have such a hard time understanding if this guy is really interested in me and i feel like that might help me clarify what i want . as mentioned , we were talking to each other everyday for a few months , he never initiated seeing me in those months unless i did . i thought after a while he would lose interest since i am taken and that we don' t date . but the text messages kept coming , at some point he even mentioned he wanted me to cook for him in exchange of him doing something for me in return which i thought was definitely suggestive. . i couldn' t bear it anymore since i didn' t know what to think of all of this so i told him that i wanted to take my distance because i had to think what i thought of my relationship to which he just responded that he didn' t think of the consequence of us talking everyday but that he understands which to me seemed like a rejection . a few months went by and i decided to talk to him again casually because i couldn' t get over him and thought that would help me move on . but he just started talking to me again everyday. . i' ve been thinking to ask him clearly what he thinks of me , but i feel like he just doesn' t know either and part of me is also scared of rejection and that maybe i ' m in denial of the first rejection i got so i would seem crazy to him to ask again when he already mentioned he didn' t think of it that way . what are your thoughts ? thanks in advance on your insights !

isfj,"this is so long . i am sorry . i tried to be concise , but. . all the feelings.see tldr at the end. . i am a pretty trueblue type( with some j tendencies in work environments ), including the lovely ability to feel all the feelings and express none of them , especially when i may be slightly paranoid that expression of said feelings will not be wellreceived or may do more harm than goodi don' t worry so much about being judged for my choices or actions , but i do worry about how my feelings and their expression affect others and how they feel about me .( if you' re wondering what makes types hard to read. . that' s what it is. )i have had relationships with men all over the mbti spectrum , but vast majority nf or nts , which also represent most of my friends . so this whole sf thing is. . new territory. . i am now in a fairly new datingnotyetcommitted relationship with a man i very strongly suspect is typehe is a selfdescribed introvert and good listener , remembers details , has a lot of routines , is a dad and clearly has a very strong sense of duty toward his child( does very intentional and thoughtful things for him ), has had the same stable job for overyears , stubborn , values tradition and close friendships , etc . he was very forward and affectionate for the first couple of weeksdates( daily contact from the beginning ), and we had a fantastic connection and chemistry with lots of shared valuesgoals despite our very clearly opposite personality traits( which i can already see as complementarybalancing ), and then a tragedy in his close circle of friends required some shufflinguncertainty of dates during the third and fourth weeks , and he suddenly seemed quite distant , though at one point hein a frustratedbuttryingtostayteasing toneinformed me that i should act like i liked him if i liked him . i was confused , because i could tell he was being distant , though figured he surely was still interested if he wanted me to act interested , but couldn' t figure out why if that was true he was being distant in the first place , and then the distance persisted even as i reached out more . finally , it all came to a head , and through a very direct conversation about feelings on both sides , i had the massive aha !moment when he said that he thought i cared , and because i cared , that i would reach out frequently to check on him after the tragedy struck , and then i didn' t , and then when he told me to act like i liked him if i did and iin a moment of confusion and paralysis of fear on being asked to actually express emotion directlysqueaked out something like i was trying to play it cool ? !i really like you , he was completely thrown off because he read that as gameplaying( rather than just my own insecurities )and so he had been acting distant because he felt distant and uncertain and oh i never explicitly thanked him for dinner( true storywhen i like someone my brain completely freaks out at the end of dates and i have no idea what i say and often realize likedays later that i didn' t say thank you and feel terrible and embarassed but have always hoped that no one noticed. ) . . oof . miscommunication central .( meanwhile , in type girlland , i was trying not to come on too strong despite being totally smitten and trying to respect the fact that i' ve only known him for a couple weeks and so he probably doesn' t want me to be the person trying to reach out and support him because i care about him but i ' m not his girlfriend so i will just give him space to process the tragedy and let him show back up when he feels more stable and.wait where is he ? )so after we have this conversation and figure out that both of our interpretations were just totally off( i care very much and thought i was being caring by not pushing him to communicate with someone he barely knows during a very personally sad time , he is distant because he is feeling hurt and unappreciated , not disinterested ), i very timidly asked about moving forward and if these things are dealbreakers( and was certain he was going to be like , ugh , this is way too hard , no way , have a nice life ), and he was like what ? you' re great . of course i want to see you again. . oh . okay . yay !so . we' re moving forward , and have explicitly stated that our goals are simple , honest , and fun and that when i am feeling something , i will share it( which is , like , totally terrifying but also , you know , healthy. ). it wasn' t until after this conversation that i started hunting around for his mb type( he didn' t know it when i asked him about it on our second date ), and when i read the type description , literally everything about what had happened became so clear , and it was like there was a spotlight on all the ways i had acted exactly oppositely from what he would have interpreted as totally interested and caring( and why i misread his cues as well ). the irony being( cue o ' henry. )that if i had just openly expressed my feelingswhich , given my allornothing nature , are typically considered a bit much by mostand texted on the regular when i was genuinely thinking about him , and stopped panicking about what he thought about me so much i lost all my manners , the miscommunication would have been solved .( he also could do with a little feelingsharing , but i know he thinks he wasand he technically wasit was just that i didn' t get what the cause of the feeling was. )one challenge i ' m going on vacation , and our schedules don' t line up this week , so we won' t see each other for like. .weeks( and the feelings conversation was by phone ). which at first made me anxious , because i feel like we' re going to lose all this momentum , but instead i am trying to see it as an opportunity to build a better foundation . therefore , i come humbly to you all to ask. .)does my overall interpretation of him as type seem accurate ?)we have not had a conversation about commitment , though i get the sense that what he would really like is what i might consider closer to girlfriendlevel communication , despite not having had that conversation .( this is not an issue for mei am certainly not dating anyone elseand fall heavily on the loyal , dedicated , and terrible at leaving bad relationships side of the types , rather than the grass is greener syndromeand i think if we had seen each other this weeknext week , that conversation would happen once we actually had interaction beyond the feelings talk and both felt like the decision to move forward was the right one , just. . timing. ). but it still is counter to , like , the majority of dating advice to be constantly reaching out to a man who hasn' t made an explicit commitment( i actually said something like this to himthat i didn' t know him that well yet , to know what he would need in a time of personal tragedy , and that cultural wisdom was that you don' t smother a guy with interest in the beginning , and he was genuinely baffled at why i would ever , ever feel like i was overstepping my bounds or bothering him by reaching out to him , and thatreally great dates was enough permission. ). do you crazy fools really mean it when you say you want to hear all the positive affirmation and confirmation buzzing around in my spastic brain ? i mean.when i really like someone. . it' s a lot .)i do still feel like he is holding back and testing the waters a little , though it seems like expressing feelings isgaspactually working . is that the case , if you' ve been hurt and feeling like you can' t fully trust the other person to appreciate younot walk all over you ? i mean , now that i understand why he was feeling that way , i totally get it , and i am happy to keep going with feels and affirmation and appreciativenesshell , i have whole lists stored up from the first few weeks , and basically getting begged to express them is kind of a dreambut with consistency in that as we move forward , the trust will come ?' cause , you know , we types like reciprocation example i had to be the one to reach out to verify plans or no plans for this week( we had been waiting for his schedule to be confirmed ), which was frustrating because he had said he would let me know , but since he did respond and with a somewhat guarded expression of disappointment that he had an unescapable commitment( for his child )on the only night that would have worked , i expressed disappointment that our schedules weren' t lining up to see each other before my vacation , and then he said something about me forgetting all about him since it would be so long , i said something reassuring and teasing , and he came back with can' t wait to hear about the vacationit was like he was waiting to see if i was really going to follow through on my end before he started reciprocating interest again . but it did make me feel like things were progressing in the right direction , after like a week of getting polite , pleasant , and positivebut limitedresponses to my texts . tldri think he is telling me that he means what he says and says what he means , and he likes hearing all my warm and fuzzy feelings about him . all the time . and if i ' m confused , i can ask , and he will tell me what is going on . he says he' s simple , and that i am overcomplicating matters by worrying about how he will react to my natural instinctsexpressions of feeling , and to stop it and just talk to him . this sounds too good to be true . is it really that simple ? are you all unsmotherable if you really like someone? ?( assuming i allow some alonedown time , which i absolutely have no issue with , as i need it , toooh , and not making , like , crazy big jumps into futuretalk because. . no. ) "
enfp,"i have question for my fellow types where do you stand on the subject of. . lowers voice infidelity ? i' ve seen it stated around here that us types are closer to serial monogamers than outright cheaters . that as nedom fiaux , we tend to rely strongly on our value systems , which at least theoretically would imply wanting a deep emotional connection with our sexual partners , and a repulsion for the idea of deeply hurting our significant others . it all sounds very pretty , and all , but i wonder if one thing is actually linked to the other . so i think the question is , do you find that to be your case , fellow types ? or , if you know any types in real life , or have dated or been married to one , were they of that opinion ? also , it would be nice if we could discuss the whole cheating topic. . so here' s an extra few questions if you' re in the mood for debating . i am particularly interested in answers from types , but hey , this is a discussion , so everybody' s welcome .what is infidelity to you ? what do you consider cheating ? what are your parameters ? as in , it' s not cheating if i ' m not married , or . . if we' re not living together , or .if it' s just making out , or a onenightstand with no deep emotional attachment , or .even fantasyzing with someone else is cheating in my book ?how much are you or have you been willing to forgive from your partner ? do you consider infidelity an unforgivable offense ? or would there be extenuating circumstances ? how much would you be( or have you been )able to tolerate ? would you continue in a relationship with someone you know has been unfaithful to you ? as in , i would forgive my partner if they told me immediately and promised never to do it again , or .if it' s a purely sexual thing , or .i know about it and they wouldn' t leave me to be with this other person ?if you' re comfortable sharing , have you ever cheated on a partner ? within that line , feel free to elaborate as much or as little as you want , please .)any other comments or questions on the subject would , also , be very welcome . of course , i' ll share my views here , too."
enfj,"hey guys !do you ever say your thoughtsopinions to people ? if you do , do you find that they react to you with a lot of criticism?"
istp,"hello friends!i' d like to know if some people around here were willing to hear my story . it' s a long story . one which began more thanyears ago . in essence , it' s the story about a fellow type that felt in love with some type female a long time ago . a story where , inyears , i still haven' t figure out how to break the shell of that person . she basically runs far away any time she realises our relation is deeper than any other one she has in her life recently , after more thanattempts to see her by me andby her , i wrote her a letter telling her not that i love her but rather that she was really different to me , that i wanted to see the side of her i never saw , etc . my primary question isis that normal that she hasn' t answered it? i put it in her boxdays ago , i' d figure it would take herdays max to answer even if it was a negative one"
enfp,"the challenge is to tell usrandom facts about you as an type . i think it would be fun to compare stories . heres mine. when i was a little kid i used to create fake memories by reading books and watching tv . i remember going on the great wall of china with big bird , walking across the egyptian desert with the people from the bible and i used to always dream about my holiday i had in australia when i was eight with my parents and i don' t know how many of my memories actually happened . some people would say i can remember my past life but i don' t believe any of that crap because i ' m a christian .. i looked up this boy on facebook two days ago that i used to have a huge crush on when i was. he actually asked me out at one point but i said no . i laughed when i saw that he posted ratemypoop. com looks like i didn' t lose out on much by turning him down .. taylor swifts music makes me wonder how different i would be if i had done the whole relationship thing . she acts like this rejected victim in half her songs , but its not like she hasn' t had any experiance . it just goes to show anyone can be bitter about their love lifes . i' ve never had a boyfriend and never been kissed . i was going to save my kiss for my wedding day for a while when i heard it was a really special thing some christians do , but now i ' m not sure . i don' t think it really matters anyway , because it doesn' t look like i will be in that situation for a long , long time .. people often mistake me for a fourteen or fifteen year old . i think its because i have pretty good skin and i have a really weird , innocent voice .. i used to have a massive crush on arnold from hey arnold !it used to keep me up at night even though i knew we could never be together . its kind of funny because the feelings i had for him are similar to the ones for the guys i like now in intensity .. i tend to go for guys that are way out of my league because i think every girl deserves the best and to be happy . i want to be with someone who absolutely adores me , and can lead me in the ways of the lord . i watchfirst dates and swoon . that is what i want !( minus the amnesia of course , lol !). my favourite class in highschool was art history . i find it hard to study art on my own time because i find that museums and books tend to describe art in the most boring way imaginable . i think my favourite way to learn about that stuff now that i ' m out of highschool is to read the horrible histories books .. theres a big history of depression in my family . i think i ' m the first to get bipolar though .. my mum was married at my age .( i ' m). i love france and desperately want to go back . i love the crossiants with the chocolate in the middle , or without the chocolate in the middle , the shops and the scenary . when i was standing outside the airport waiting to be collected i was stunned by how modern the city around me looked and how clean everything was . i also had a blast at disneyland although some of the people were a bit rude .. i either want to be a preschool or primary school teacher , a youth pastor , a photographer , a movie director , an astronaut , a nutrictionist , be a writer , or have my own tourism company . i want to make lots of money , but my main talents are interacting with children and writing . i plan on having a few best sellers one day and being friends with taylor swift but i don' t think i ' m ready for the success yet .. i desperately want to fall in love , get married , travel the world , have heaps of my own kids , design my own home and adopt more kids . i am in love with someone a few years older than me but as i said before he is way out of my league . my parents really like him but all his friends think i ' m crazy for even thinking i have a chance with him . i ' m not sure what is wrong with me but they said i ' m not his type whatever thats supposed to mean , considering they don' t know me that well . i think hes expecting some six foot model that can sing and play four instruments and worship god with all their might . i don' t look good on paper because i' ve had a really rough few years since i started and finished highschool , but i know i ' m a good person and good times are ahead . i ' m hoping one day anyone who turned me down because of their ill percieved ideas about be will be kicking themselves with regret .. i would love to go to singapore . i ' m not totally sure why , but our geography teacher told us all about it his trip and showed us pictures . it looks like a really beautiful place . i also really want to go to thailand because my dad has been there , what was shown in the second bridget jones movie and because i really want to on ride elephant back . india and going on an african safari are also on my bucket list .. heaps of my friends are stunningly beautiful and i wonder why they want to hang out with me .. i love fashion but suck at putting outfits together and accessorising . i want to kidnap gok wan and keep him in my wardrobe , pulling him out when i need to go shopping( and someone elses credit card , ha !). i hate cookies and cream icecream , but cookie dough is my favourite flavour . weird .. my friend used to think my mum dressed up as a nurse for fun . she didn' t realise that she actually was a nurse . she also thought the teachers lived at school and didn' t have a life outside of it .. i really like paris hilton even though i know shes a bad role model and not a great person . i love her wardrobe as well and would love to have designers sending me boxes of free clothes every day .. i was bullied from the ages of twelve to fourteen , and an outcast from the ages of sixteen to eighteen because i changed highschool and the friends i had for a year all dropped out or split from our group of friends , which is why i think i ' m so insecure now . i find it easier to believe lies about myself than the nice things my friends tell me . i don' t believe that i ' m pretty , that i' ll ever be skinny enough , that i ' m smart enough or that people will ever geniunely like me for me , but i ' m proven wrong all the time . i had stuff thrown at me , people would talk about me in a derogatory manner from three feet away where i could obviously hear them , everything i wore got scrutinized , i was always picked last for sports teams and pe , people played heaps of nasty pranks on me and i got cyber bullied . i can' t remember everything that happened but it was pretty bad . i even got left behind on a school trip four hours from my home for two hours because no one noticed that i was gone . i' ve been called a slut , a lesbian and a cry baby . i considered commiting suicide several times and even came up with different ideas of how i wanted to do it so they would find me body in a certain way , but i never went through with it . all of this has haunted me for the past six years , and noone seems to understand how much its hurt me and deformed who i really am on the inside , because my innocence was stripped too soon , i forgot how to trust people and started to believe that my purpose in life was to amuse people even if it meant them crippling me in every possible way . it has provided inspiration for a book i ' m planning on writing to show the instensity of the feelings i went through at such a young age being so emotionally abused . if i hadn' t started calling on god when i was fourteen i would probably be dead now .. if i won lotto , i would build my dream home with multiple rooms and walk in wardrobes,outdoor swimming pools and rollarcoaster , my own library and rollerskating rink and a photography studio with several models of cameras , lenses and shooting equipment . i would also buy thousands of clothes once i had got to a suitable weight for my height and actually looked good in them and go on a big world trip with a few of my friends . i think it would be cool to pay for a few of their educations secretly , because i don' t know if i will ever go to university because of my illness , although i ' m sure i' ll succeed at whatever i do because i have a strong work ethic .. i like new zealand better than england because summer is more intense , i have friends there , they have proper bbqs and better food . i really miss it , but i don' t want to move back until i' ve saved some money and lost heaps of weight . i want my friends to be shocked and excited to see the change in me when i get home . some of them ask me when i ' m coming back everytime i talk to them . aww tear .. i used to be obsessed with cats , then with pokemon , then with avril lavigne , then with sailor moon and now i ' m obsessed with taylor swift and photography .. i want to call one of my girls chloe because the headgirl in my year was called that and she was one of the sweetest girls i' ve ever met , as well as one of the most successful and i love the way chloe sounds . i would be so embarrassed if she found out about that though .. when i was a little kid i desperately wanted a pet elephant . i was convinced i could have my own after seeing dumbo . my dad ended up taking me to the petshop( ok , i don' t remember this part but thats how he tells the story )and they said they didn' t have any . my older sister tried to make me ask for a puppy at the last minute but i didn' t listen . i wish i had .. my middle name is beth . i hate it."
estp,"this is more aimed at type guys in particular , but any girl types also feel free to chime in i ' m just interested in your way of behaving in this kind of situation . if you like a person as more than just a friend and see them around daily would you go for it ? would you need some kind of signal or reassurance or just think fuck it and give it a go anyway ? for you , would it be worse potentially creating an awkward situation in the futureruining a friendship , or not going for it at all when there might have been something there ? thanks for taking the time to respond ! "
enfj,"long time no chat , types and onlookers . it' s been a while , so i hope ya' ll are doing alright !i was hoping to get your opinions and insights , because. . well , i have a problem that shouldn' t seem like a problem at all . i ' m an type( female )dating a male who i' ve tentatively typed as an type . we were friends for a while before i was single again , and then i realized just how incredible he really was and he told me he liked me and we started dating . things are going great , and i know he truly cares about me and loves me , too . i certainly see him as someone who i could be with for quite some time . we' re both in a place in our lives where we' re looking for someone who could be a lifepartner , so we' re both taking things seriously . but here' s the rub . he has no. . pain . i mean , kill me , right ? he' s just. . whole . he' s stable . he' s confident , but not cocky . he' s comfortable with who he is . he' s been hurt in relationships , but he' s gotten over them . he' s just. . okay all by himself . he doesn' t need anything from anyone . he' s happy on his own , but he' s happier with me . i know what you' re thinking . well , damn , steph , sounds like you found a real fuckin 'keeper . what are you complaining about ? he' s hot , stable , confident , loves you , and you have really good chemistry . but my problem is i connect to others best through pain . my last two long term relationships were good relationships , and i was certainly in love before . in those relationships , i did what i did best , and it' s something i think a lot of types do stunningly well take away other peoples pain through emotional comfort , shouldering or sharing burdens , and being there for them when the going gets really tough . i also really connect with others through being able to help them reach their goals , and encouraging them to push themselves . but. . but he doesn' t have that kind of pain . i ' m not saying he' s an innocent guy ,' cause he' s absolutely not . he just. . is so' okay 'with life . he claims he wasn' t always this way , and that hiking the pct in five months really changed him , but for the life of me , i don' t know how in the fuck to deal with it . he' s not worried about the future , he doesn' t have any bad childhood baggage , his family is still together , he doesn' t have any medical or mental issues , he' s enjoying his life daybyday without putting pressure on himself to get betterfasterstronger , he' s just. . he' s so fucking' okay '. and his goals consist of hiking more and buying a home in a few years . and , ya' ll , i' ll tell you , i ' m over here like , hey anxiety , i ' m feeling hella behind and lost in my life , i ' m going back to school for another degree but unsure of it and really just want to make a difference and earn a good living and not have to work three jobs , i have a hard time relaxing , i have a mild martyr complex , i ' m a writer , emotionally unstable( but not crazy at least ), i journal about my problems , and get angry and emotional over things , and he' s just cool as a fuckin 'cucumber . and he' s going to hike without me doing a damn thing to help him anyway . and i don' t know how to help him . i don' t know how to feel like i provide value . i mean , yeah , sure , i make him laugh , and we have chemistry , and we love each other , and companionship , and blahblahblah , but what is my purpose in the relationship aside from to enjoy it ? i need more depth , i need more intimate connection , i need to get down there and scrape through him until i ' m cuddled up against the marrow of his bones and understand every bit of who he is from his fears , to his flaws , to the secrets he' s never let on . but he claims he just. . is who he is , and that he' s a simple guy and that' s all there is to him . i ' m at a total loss . i don' t know what role to play in the relationship , and i need one . i don' t know what to do about it .tldr i ' m dating a man that has no emotional pain or baggage for me to help him through in order to connect , and i ' m finding it hard to find my role as a valueprovider in the relationship aside from just being a loving companion , which you can find in many people . how do you connect the deepest with your significant other , and have you ever been with someone who doesn' t have pain ? as types , i feel like we have an intimate relationship with sharing pain( hello , fe ), and not connecting through it is so strange to me."
infj,"its said , that type are the best choice for type . but right now i dont really feel like that . at least at the moment . lets look at the main functinos i have a strong ni and i feel like that the fi of type gives me time to process . ne can in theory listen to my ni thoughts , but i do feel like it could be too boring for ne . and i also fear , that ne could be a magnet to new factors into the relationship . for example i know an type that loves to party , which sounds like a nightmare for my ni at the moment . these days im pretty introverted , but sooner or later i will be more out going again . then an type could be better for me . but my concern is , that my main will always be ni and therefor i really wonder how type is said to be the best match . could ni and ne really work well together ? or does it bore ne too much?"

estj,"i don' t know if it' s the difference that' s attractive , or that i ' m not being very positive , but it' s sort of tiring crying personally i like to predict the other person so that i could understand them better but i wonder if it is the unpredictibality that could potentionally be attractive ? i am not seeing that. . it takes more time for me to predict an type . have you ever been in a relationship with an type ? what were the outcomes ? which one do you think is more ideal , type or type ? or something else?"
enfp,"my absolute best friend is an type , which types are not thought to get along with well . i have found the complete opposite to be true !we have enough similarities to have common ground , but we also make up for each other' s weaknesses in certain areas( type helps me with organization , i help type with people skills ). i ' m also a bit more practical and organized than your average type , and more introverted than most extroverts . i love being around my type friend because they are rational and grounded , but still open to creativity and deep discussions . we have very similar values and interests as well . any other types with type friends ? how well do you get along?"

enfp,"think about what he' s done . he was good at organizing . he was a charmeur , in fact he was a womanizer .( now , i was not expecting this )he was not good in math , in fact he sucked at math , but he was good at poetry or literature . he was almost more a politican than a phisicyst . he made something believable what everyone thought was not possible . now what is ne if not that ? overall i think oppenheimer was an type . his enthusiasm won him over when he realized he could create something what others couldn' t , but ultimately he realized what he' s done and he called for supervision . i think it fits the type profile more than anything .? btw i think teller was type"
istj,"lord help me . i was without my car last week and had to rely on my motherinlaw whom i think is type to take me back and forth to work last week . my job ishour away , and it wasn' t a joy ride with her . we' ve clashed in the past , but these trips were especially insightful . she' s informed me i ' m not supposed to go to church if there are chores to be done( and there are always chores to be done . for example if you dusted and vacuumed yesterday , chances are there might be dust reaccumulated , or even pet hair if you are pet owner like me and therefore you must vaccum and mop . you never put church above your work and work comes first before anything else . there' s always work to do !( she vacuumed my house twice on friday. )when i got home from work on friday , she had cleaned myyear old son' s room even though i told her before that my children and my rooms were off limits to her cleaning because those are our personal spaces . well obviously she forgot . and while she was cleaning under my bed she found two empty boxes and wanted to know what they were from and why they were there. . one was the box the laptop i received for christmas came in , and the other was the box my dvd player came in . she also found a random shoe that was way up under the bed that i didn' t know was there and that really irked her . she also told me that since i put some papers in my work bag( i ' m in training )that i had to clean out my work bag and organize it and put the papers in their proper place( i am an type , organization is what i do , i just don' t make other people organize their stuff , or give them lists of things they need to do , like my type mother in law does ). i am. my mother in law is. i believe my husband()is type but i ' m not totally sure . he' s nonconfrontational . says he doesn' t let what his mom does or says get to him . lets it go one ear and out the other( but i doubt it ). any thoughts on how an type deals with a narcissistic type motherinlaw ? thanks for your help."
istj,"hello , i ' m new to this place so please forgive me if i do something stupid . basically , i ' m confused . at various points in time , i have taken online personality tests . sometimes i have had type returned , sometimes i have had type returned . having read around , i can identify traits that i have that are common in both personality types , leaving me puzzled . so i have come here , and i am hoping a more knowledgeable person than myself will be able to help me out . below i have identified some of the traits that define me , in the hope that at least one of them would definitely identify me as one type or the other . i would appreciate it if it people could have a read through them to see what you think . if you feel the information i have supplied is inadequate or insufficient than ask away and i' ll try and reply as quickly as is possible . thanks . traits studying physics , also very much enjoy mathematics . take great pleasure in applying mathematical tools in physics to achieve a useful result . also like it when i realise connections between seemingly different areas of mathematics areas of physics . my brother seems to think that i think everything that isn?t done my way is wrong . hate wasting time , more so when someone else is wasting my time( e.g . having to wait for someone ). inside i?ll get quite frustrated with that person , especially if it means possibly being late for something . almost everything i do is for my own mental or physical benefit . i like staying fit , and often seek intellectual stimulation . always challenging myself and setting goals for myself( some are very long term , on the timescale of years ). regularly try to master new and challenging skills . will sometimes experience brief infatuations with some subjects , researching them intensely for a short period of time . some fascinations last . if i read a word that i have never come across before , i will almost always look it up and not just skim over it . never read novels , only books with factual information that can quench my thirst for knowledge . selfmotivated and extremely attentive to detail , often spending hours over a piece of work in an attempt to perfect it , and then becoming frustrated with myself for spending too much time on it . loyal , punctual and committed . have an untidy desk most of the time , but enjoy it when it is tidy . sometimes won?t sleep because my mind doesn?t stop talking to itself . i would rather the truth over harmony . sometimes uncomfortable about doing things that aren?t planned in advance( e.g . the next day ). don?t communicate my inner feelings readily . thanks to those who managed to read all of this . your help would be greatly appreciated."
enfj,"chances are if you are somewhat familiar with cognitive functions that you associate fe with social harmony . basically fe doms( types , types )strive to maintain social harmony by being agreeable , even to a fault . like seriously the lengths that fe doms will go through to avoid conflict is amazing . i should know because i have done it and still do it to this day . for the benefit of our none fe dominant people , can you explain what it is about conflict you don' t like and why you avoid conflict?"

istp,"i am a type female married to an type male . we have been together nearlyyears and married for nearly. our sex life was normal , hot and heavy at first , died down a little but not all together with career changes , stress , etc . we at least had it once a week but more often than nottimes( normal ). on are honeymoon i was super charged and it was wonderful . once we got back to normal life sex slowly started to diminish . the kicker ? it wasn' t me( the female ), it was him . i noticed it around valentinesyears ago . i dressed up all sexy like i usually do but he wasn' t in the mood . i thought i must have gained weight( i ' m a small girl )and went on a diet , of course thinking this had to be my fault . as a type , i have to know the problem so i can fix it . that wasn' t the problem . he told memonths ago that he loved me but didn' t like me and that he had not enjoyed sex for quite some time . it took himmonths to make the appointment but he finally started seeing a therapist a couple of weeks ago . she told him we have may have a personality conflict . i asked him if i had changed and he said no , there are just parts of your personality that i don' t like and i ' m not sexually turned on by you due to them . he isn' t very specific . he is still super sweet , loves to cuddle , kisses me goodbye and when he gets home every day . he is not good at communicating and it' s driving me crazy . the last time we had successful sex was last september on our anniversary trip . that was after having a huge fight over not having sex . i ' m mad because it took himmonths to even go see someone about this . i mean what man is okay just not having sex ? he told his therapist my wife is hot as shit but i ' m not sexually attracted to her . because of his personality type , i am always the one who makes the decisions and i often initiated sex . well i ' m not now because i know he doesn' t want to and i ' m scared of flat out rejection . he now mentions things like we never do what i want to do or we don' t have the same interest when i ' m trying to get him to talk to me . i ' m sitting here thinking we do all kinds of stuff together that we both like , why would he say that ? . we sail , we camp , we tailgate , we entertain and cook out we are best friends , or at least i thought we were . he says that i do things that anger him but he doesn' t tell me about them for months . i understand that i can say or do things that are blunt and i assume this is just my personality but what on earth could i have done or said that would make him just not want to have sex with me ? i mean nothing sexual at all !i ' m constantly trying to grow as an individual and be more relaxed and easy going even though that goes against everything in my nature . nothing is wrong with him physically( we went to our primary care )and he doesn' t seem to be very stressed out( he never does though ). i' ve read every book and tried everything to fix this . since he doesn' t really know what the problem is , i can' t fix it and it' s driving me nuts . i ' m almost depressed and i so long the intimacy of having sex with my husband !he won' t move forward in our relationship( buying a house , having a child , etc )since we have this huge problem . divorce is not an option and i ' mthat he isn' t cheating on me or addicted to porn . any advice ? please?"

intj,"i find debating with types is a really aggravating endeavor . they tend to go on tangents all the time that to me are irrelevant . they always get ultra anal about definitions , and although there are times when it is relevant , mots of the time i don' t know the issue they' re concerned about that they feel necessitates discussing the definition of a term while discussing the topic at hand . interestingly , types also find my points irrelevant for some reason . the jp thing is a huge switch because all the cognitive functions are completely different . types , who have the sameconscious cog funcs get you better than types."
estj,"types are often the antagonists of movies , and they are usually portrayed as the obnoxious person who is completely oblivious to the big picture , acts before he thinks everything through , and is just a pain in everyone' s ass . i just finished watching jurassic world , and a good example from that movie is the army dude( lol forget his name )who wanted to incorporate dinosaurs into the military( lol sounds like an type thing ). how do you types perceive this ? does it annoy you guys to be presented more often than not as antagonists , and more often than not as obnoxious ones more so than intelligent ones ? i.e . , a lot of types are presented as antagonists however , they usually have this mastermind take of the world caricature that presents them as very calculating and forward thinking , if not selfcentered and lacking compassion . even though the person is evil some types would like the main image presented , which is calculating , forward thinking , take no shit mastermind . i don' t know what my question actually means after i typed all that( lol ne dom probz ), but basically how do types react to the common portrayal of types in moviestv shows , particularly when it comes to antagonists."

esfp,"i am certain without a doubt i am an xsfp personality type but i am not sure if i am type or type . i will describe myself and hobbies etc and maybe it can help create a more accurate picture of which type i lean more towards . i understand they both use the same functions , just slightly different orders . i am very passionate about music . i am a songwriter and record music myself and it by far myway i express myself to the world . songs can move me deep inside instantly and i can listen to a song on repeat over and over . i know whether i like something right away . i connect to the overall feel . i tend to like moody indie folkpop type music but my taste is very eclectic . i love nature and anything being surrounded in dramatic landscapes . the forest , coastline , mountains , and open countryside bring me so much peace and happiness . it?s like i am totally rejuvenated after being in those environments . i am highly affected by lighting and sensitive to changes in the immediate environment . i am captivated by sunsets . i love going for drives or riding my motorcycle . something about it just grounds me and helps me feel relaxed and at ease in the world . it also allows me to see new sights and take time to reflect which i love !i do enjoy people but i spend a significant time alone , not always by choice but by the nature of my lifestyle and job etc . i am very independent by nature , and do most things alone . something i have always enjoyed doing is people watching . i love to analyze what is happening around me . i am very passionate with my beliefs and values . if i see someone either violating those , or not respecting mine , it is an instant turn off for me and i do not have any desire to create connection with that person any longer . i am a huge advocate for treating others with kindness and compassion , and listening to others and validating their opinions and beliefs regardless if ours don?t align . that being said , i can be very outgoing and life of the party in some situations especially with close friends or family , but also very quiet and reflective too depending on the mood i am in . when there is too much stimuli around me , i can get rather frazzled and overloaded . i am sensitive to energy around me . this is me in a nutshell !let me know what you think !

infj,"hi , wow , haven' t been active in here for aboutyears and this site has changed a lot . anyway , first of all how is everyone doing( i' d genuinely love to know )? and i came back around here because i ' m wondering if this is an type thing , or if anyone can relate . story time . i had a coworker who , after hanging out a lot outside of work i became romantically interested in . asked her out over a year ago now , and she said no( which is totally fine ). we still talked and whatnot until she randomly disappeared for aboutmonths . turns out she was in rehab . getting older m i ' m recognizing means less people you meet who you could potentially datehave a romantic interest in . i hate dating apps , so i know there' s an opportunity to do that , but otherwise limited options . so aboutmonths ago she pops back up and we agree to hangout and get tea( our thing we do ). i was so nervous to be around her again , we hadn' t hung out since i asked her out . but what was nice was as soon as we started talking it' s like all the time we hadn' t spoken collapsed and like it had only been a week , which was a super nice feeling . after we hung out we agreed to have tea at my house at some point . more nerves , i' ve not had anyone over at my house since like. i am , as my mentor described me , very aloof . in between the time i started thinking about how maybe now that over a year has gone by , perhaps things had changed and maybe we could date . the year prior i was really struggling with my mental health , she was dealing with hers , and i was thinking that was the divide( spoiler it wasn' t ). unfortunately we weren' t able to get tea at mine because she caught covid . so we postponed . i texted her today and she casually mentions how she moved to another city( a few hours away ), spur of the moment , and i felt sort of heartbroken . i wasn' t fully invested in wanting to date her , in reflection i think the idea of dating her was the real issue , but still . but then i realized i know nobody in my life , for the first time since i had any romantic attraction to someone , who could even be a possibility . nobody . for once whoever it could be is a stranger to me right now . and sure , everyone is a stranger at some point , but this is different for me . so i ' m wondering if it' s an type thing to seek comfort in the idea of dating someone ? i hope that makes sense . for clarification( if needed )does it make sense to find comfort in even the idea of dating someone you know , especially someone you' re friends with ? also please tell me how you' re doing , even if not replying to the rest of this."

esfj,"hello i feel very frustrated at the moment and i would appreciate some advice from type types . i ran into the following situation i?ve had a more thanyears relationship with an type girl . at the start of our relationship i was very eager to show her that i like her with giving her steady attention and put a lot of effort into our dates and make her happy . now maybe about a year ago i felt very stressed through work and sometimes tend to complain to her about small unnecessary things . and because i worried to get good sleep to endure the work stress , i wanted her to sleep in a different room when she slept at my place . things get worse when the corona crisis started this year because i got a lot of anxiety i could get infected maybe . so we had a few discussion about that and i scold her even more often . so recently she started moving into my house , i scold her again a few times the last two months because i think we had to get used to live together . and i also neglect her a bit , because i was tied up by my fear about the corona virus . i still tried to show her my love in other ways , maybe in preparing often food for her work or listening to her stories about at the evening . but she always had to wait for me to be ready to listen her stories . i wanted to get things done before i commit my full attention to her . so yeah she already had the feeling i neglected her , and i sometimes skipped dinner and let her eat alone . although she just wanted someone to talk to while eating dinner . and we already had a big discussion that she didn?t want me to scold her that much . i tried to work on myself but sometimes i fall into old patterns and scold her again . i know now that type types take every discussion very personal , but i didn?t realized that on that time . and i didn?t mean it very personal , it was things like ?please drive a bit more carefully ? but i tended to say such things like that more and more often the last year . i think that i personally developed some type of depression but i didn?t tell her until our big breakup one day , she went to the gym and i already said to her i didn?t want her to go there because she maybe can get infected there . and i warned her that she should stay home at her parents house if she would go there even if she just recently moved into my house . so she came back and i was upset that she went to the gym and tried to stay hard and said that she should sleep at her parents house the next two weeks or so . she then went so upset about that , that she packed her stuff and moved out . i tried to drive after her but it was to late she already was to hurt and seemed to made her decision . two days later i explained her that i think i developed some type of depression and i will search help at a therapy and i think that was the main reason why i introverted so much the last months and start to scold her so often . she said that she still have strong feelings for me and loves me but is to hurt right now . her heart wants me but her head says no . that were her words . since this talk two weeks ago , i often tried to convince her that i won?t fall back into this pattern . i mean the first thing is to recognize there is a depression and the second thing is that i already had my first appointment at a therapy and began to work on myself . i understand totally that she is hurt , even more since i know that she is an type type girl . so i wrote her a lot of letters , that i understand herand also the effort she always put into our relationship and also made her very personal gifts which she really liked . i met her two days ago and we talked a bit and i already could show her that i changed already a bit and i am on my way for improvement . but she still said that she tries to hold her heart back and listen to her head because she don?t want to get hurt again . she told me that her pet has died two weeks unfortunately , so i came over to her with a new baby pet . but she rejected me this time and said that i should maybe not come again . it is very difficult for me right now because on the one hand i can feel that she still loves me and is happy to see me and also about my gifts and i try to show her how much she means to me , on the other hand her thoughts of her head comes back and she tries to reject me . i really love her and i don?t would get tired to show her that , but i have the feeling the more i try right now , the more she withdraw a bit . i really would pass through fire for her and have the feeling i have to show her that more."
istj,"i am placing these list from susan storm?s website . you should not use this list in an attempt to determine your type . instead the list is being placed here for discussion among type types or compare list with other types that you may want to compare and contrast .. you use your past as a guide for the future as you go through life , you consider it your moral obligation to learn from each experience , whether it?s a failure or a success . you collect these experiences and recall them when a crisis hits or a solution is needed to a problem . that said , if you?re in an unhealthy phase of life , you might get hooked on bad habits from your past? enjoying the comfort or thrill of these habits and wanting to relive them even if they have negative consequences .. you remember the facts and details of past experiences well you have a gift for remembering little details and experiences from the past . because of this , you quickly notice changes and shifts . for example , if you walk into a room , you might be the first to notice that the furniture has been rearranged . you also might notice if someone?s body language differs from their typical composure and sense that something isn?t right .. you crave a sense of routine unpredictable situations are anathema to you , so you try to have a clear direction for your day . usually you have a calendar planned out and a daily flow that helps you to know what to expect and when . this sense of routine and consistency puts you at ease and gives you the freedom to think clearly .. you enjoy reliving your favorite memories all types enjoy reminiscing from time to time , but you seem to have a special affinity for it . you can close your eyes and recall a past memory and feel as if you are really living and breathing it . the past comes to life in vivid detail and lush imagery . you can even enter a state of flow through this process . find out more things you enjoy inthings that excite the type personality type .. following through on your word is a huge priority for you because being consistent and dependable is so crucial to you , people know that they can depend on you to mean what you say and do what you say you?ll do . letting someone down or forgetting a responsibility makes you feel intense shame and frustration .. you experience dj ? vu a lot because your memory for details and experiences is so remarkable , you quickly make connections between what is happening now and what happened in the past . small similar experiences or sights can give you a sudden , unexpected feeling of dj ? vu . people of your type frequently mention having this sensation on a regular basis .. you postprocess experiences to enjoy them fully when you?re experiencing something new you tend to feel a little detached from it? as if experiencing the full weight of the present moment would be overwhelming . however , after the experience is over you often replay it in your mind? enjoying the beauty of it more after the fact than during . which leads to our next point? ?. you beat yourself up over past mistakes because you?re always trying to learn from your mistakes and you have a tendency to postprocess experiences , you have a tendency to replay embarrassing or awkward moments in your head . you might lie in bed at night beating yourself up over mistakes you madeoryears ago , feeling as if the shame and frustration of it all is happening in the present .. you try to have a calm , composed manner loud , brash , overreactive people tend to annoy you . you respect people who can maintain a sense of composure and control , even in trials and tribulations . you try to maintain an air of professionalism and coolness in any situation that presents itself .. you quickly sense changes in patterns because you?re so aware of details , facts , and past experiences , you quickly notice unexpected changes or shifts in behavior . this makes you keenly attuned to changes in patterns or inconsistencies in people .. you get a strong sense of satisfaction from crossing items off your todo list productivelyminded , you get a thrill from crossing items off a tasklist . you get a surge of joy from knowing your projects are being completed and you don?t have to worry about them anymore .. competence is crucial to you being competent and being surrounded by competent people is vital to your wellbeing . finishing tasks on time , being logical , and responding with a coolheaded manner to any crisis gives you a sense of wellbeing and confidence . this can make you a highly respected leader( check out the type leader to see more about this ).. fairness and justice are core values of yours you hate preferential treatment and believe that solid rules and regulations should be applied to all people without bias . that said , you believe clarifying the rules and making sure they are just , fair , and reasonable is crucial . you will fight relentlessly to tear down rules you see as oppressive or unjust .. you?re skeptical of overt displays of emotion when people are emotionally reactive , cloying , or effusive , you tend to get suspicious . what do they want ? are they emotionally okay ? can you trust them ? why is their eye twitching ? why are they crying ? why can?t they calm down ?. you?re a realist more than an idealist you have core values that you strive to uphold no matter the odds . but even with that in mind , you consider yourself a realist more than a dreamer . you want to know the facts and avoid having your mind clouded by theories and emotions that might cloud your ability to see the reality of a situation clearly .. ?be prepared !? is your motto you create plans and contingency plans for the future so that no matter what happens you will have a solution readily available . people count on you for your ability to organize and present alternative plans when a disaster occurs . that said , if a situation comes up that you?re unprepared for , you tend to feel trapped and overwhelmed . you need to get away to a quiet place so that you can devise a solution .. you?re skilled in the art of logistics you seem to innately know how to organize people and objects in the most efficient way . getting things done on time , getting people where they need to be , and handling many moving pieces is something you have the capability to do with nearly unmatched skill .. you have perseverance if you put your energy into something , you see no virtue in bowing out before you?ve givenof your energy to it . you put a tremendous amount of willpower into every action you take .. when you?re stressed , you see dozens of negative possibilities normally focused and grounded , when you?re severely stressed you tend to flip a switch and become filled with visions of doom and gloom . you see all the ways that your plans could unravel and all the potential security risks that lie ahead of you .. you despise pretention people who craft elaborate phrases with superfluous words tend to get on your nerves . people who try to appear like philosophers , gurus , or ?experts ? without the life experience to back it up make your skin crawl .. you put facts before personal feelings you?ve made it a top priority to place truth on a higher level of respect than emotions . your heart or feelings might be swaying you one way , but you know the facts are pointing in another direction . except in really crucial situations , you?ll follow the facts over the feelings in a situation .. you hate the idea of compromising your values what few people know except those closest to you is that you have a deep set of unchangeable values . you know what you believe to be right and wrong and you won?t compromise that for anything . you strive to stay true to your sense of integrity regardless of what the crowd is doing or what is popular at the moment .. change makes you anxious you prioritize a carefully crafted routine that you can count on no matter what life throws at you . you crave the familiar , the quiet , and the sense of continuity that comes from having a set schedule . unexpected changes make you nervous and rattled .. you hate clashing sensory details being in bright , chaotic environments or being around people who are wearing clashing patterns can make you feel uneasy and queasy . you like the things around you to be organized , calm , and aesthetically pleasing . when the details around you clash , you have an insatiable urge to ?fix ? them . this can make you seem a little obsessive and nitpicky to people who don?t share your tendencies."
intp,"i think i only now understand why videogames( especially competitive gaming , lol , wow pvp , dota )played such a big part of my life . it' s because in themmastery , knowledge , logic , math and truth alyways win . if you are correct , it will show in results . everything else is secondary . i don' t play games anymore , but lately i' ve been spending around an hour a day watching my brother and his buddies play ranked . they are not the best players( trying to enter into platinum ), and i tell them what to improve upon . they ignored most of my advices until they hit the brick wall and stagnated in their rank a week ago . now they listen and they are winning more . in the real world people ignore your advice for so many reasons , often times they are correct and you are simply missing some info or perspective , but often its because they are stubborn , irrational , intellectually lazy , unintelligent , or they have some alterior motive for refusing to do as you told themsuch as not wanting to give you credit in the workplace . whatever the case , nts constantly encounter situations in which people ignore what we say . and this world is complex enough that , unless a metric is introduced , and we can objectively track the results of action a and results of action b , most will fail to recognize that they should' ve listened . because of this , in youth , nts( especially ints )can encounter endless frustration , and only things such as video games and school exams( which mostly consist of gathering information , sadly )can properly alliviate that frustration . so it seems that some of this gaming panacea would be useful for assertive grownups as well , if they are stuck in a position that they don' t have enough agency , influence or power . it will recover selfconfidence . then leave that job and find a more objectivitybased profession . i myself wili take a break for voicing my mind irl unless something clear and objective can later be used as a metric of it' s validity . or i' ll at least try to."
enfp,"why am i writing this ? i ' m not quite sure , maybe just a distraction from the guilt and pain . i( m )broke up with my type girlfriend( f )of almostyears this weekend . she loved me and i think i loved her . but i was no longer happy in the relationship . there were a few problem areas emotional negativity we are both quite sensitive and don' t have good emotional resilience . what this looks like she can easily be in a bad mood because of various things . for example , her boss making a negative comment about her , finding out her uncle is sick , an argument in her family , me being busy and not being able see her , etc . all of these things can make her sad , and when she is sad , she withdraws , and becomes very quiet . i lack the skills to deal with these , especially given the frequency( she gets in this upset state on average once a week i' d say ). i get affected by her negative emotions , and i absorb the sadnegative energy . overtime , i start getting frustrated when she gets sad . instead being able to support her and help her process these emotions , i end up getting secretly upset at her and it can even turn into resentment at times . when she withdraws , i also feel a sense of rejection. . most of the time , her being upset has nothing to do with me , but i can' t help but take it personallyi instinctively make it about how i feel . dating an idealized version of herlack of growth in my mind , she is a wholesome , kind person with the purest soul . but i also think there are major areas she needed to work on around selfesteem , emotion regulation , and her career . so in my head , i created this potential version of what she could become , and subconsciously set this version as a goal for her . i know this is a common type trap , but i couldn' t help it . we had talked about the things she could work on at multiple points throughout our relationship . while she agreed that these are things she wants to work on for herself , it still felt like i was just manipulating her to change into a version i liked more , under the disguise of self improvement . but regardless , every time we have discussion about this , it feels like i ' m giving her a score on her self improvement progress , and we would come up with new ideas for her to work on her self . we would try some of these ideas , but these attempts will fizzle out after a few weeks . i didn' t have the consistency or patience to hold her accountable either . i was a cheerleader , but not a coach . despite our efforts and her trying , there weren' t meaningful progress over the course ofyears . for the most part , she still has the same selfesteem , emotional regulation issues , and she never actively addressed the problems she was having at work . the irony is that i think i have similar issues , maybe to a lesser degree . i also have selfesteem issues , i ' m not that great at being emotionally resilient either , and i also find work quite stressful , but i think i ' m just better at hiding my own problems . after a few iterations of these , it just feels like we are stagnant . neither of us are growing individually , and not as a couple either . and i think this is very disappointing for me , because i had already set an expectation of who she could become in my mind , and fell more and more in love with this version over time . lack of spark being an idealist , i love talking about ideas , philosophy , politics , mbti , etc . she is not interested in these things , so we don' t have very deep conversations . this isn' t a dealbreaker , since i can have these convos with friends . but it does mean that most of our conversation are quite trivial , like food , movies , gossip about others , etc . why i decided to break up both my fi and te come to the conclusion that we are not the most compatible couple . could i have developed my own emotional resilience so i ' m not as affected by her ? yes . could i have accepted who she is , in the way she is , instead of idealizing who she could become ? yes . could i just ignore the lack of intellectually stimulating conversations , fantasizing about the future , and debating about interesting topics ? yes . but , i see these as compromises . and i don' t have confidence that i will be able to stick with these compromises in the long term , without becoming frustrated and resentful . i believe that we are not the right person for each other . for her , she needs someone who is more emotionally independent , can provide consistency , and loves her for who she is . for me , i also need someone who is more emotionally stable , naturally values personal growth in each other , and dreams about the future possibilities . pain and guilt i feel sad , empty and alone . i miss her . i miss her smile . i miss the comfort that she provides . i miss being able to make her laugh . i miss taking her out to restaurants and shopping . i miss the cuddles . i miss the way she looks at me . i miss her warmth . i can barely get anything done at work . i ' m trying to distract myself , but i also feel like i deserve to feel the hurt and pain . whatever i ' m feeling , she probably has it x worse . i killed our relationship , i gave her hope , and i killed that hope . i stabbed her in the heart with my own hands . i convinced her she could be better , and i gave up on that dream . ultimately , i ended things selfishly because its more about her not being the right person for me , rather than me not being the right person for her . her heart is broken . i could hear it falling to pieces during the break up . she cried and pleaded to not end things , and at times i doubted my decision , but i told her things won' t work , things can' t work . i don' t know if she will be whole again . i know she is blaming herself for not being good enough for me , and i know she is drowning in sadness and self loathe . and thinking about that kills me inside . i feel like i murdered someone , i took someone' s love , and threw it all away . i think( and hope )i will be okay , in time . but i don' t know if she will given her problems with selfesteem , emotional regulation , and being a highly sensitive type."
estj,"hi guys !well , i don' t know if i ' m an type or type. . i' ve always thought that i was a feeler , because i really care about what other people think . then , when i told my friends about mbti , they said no !you are a thinker !. i know that i shouldn' t let others type myself , but i started to think in what they said . even my mom said i was a thinker!so i noticed. . when i care about what other people think , it' s what they think of me , because i want others to think i ' m a good( and perfect )person . when someone comes to me and say i ' m sad , i do mind and try to help the person , but. . sometimes i don' t care , i help anyway , but inside of me , i realise it' s not something important . i don' t know if you can understand me. . i' ve read that in relationships , types don' t show emotions , don' t like hugs and things like that . but i really love to show my emotions , and when i get a boyfriend( i don' t have one )i want him to know how much i love him , and i hope he' s going to be an affectionate guy . what do you think ? can you help me?"
intp,"types , i ' m interested in your personal experiences here . if this might be unhelpful to you then please pass it by this question pops into my mind sometimes , and lately i' ve had too much time to think( never a good thing ). so please help me out . i realize that any type can go through these things events , and i don' t think the trauma part , especially , would create an type , however i wonder if there is any link between an type and these possible past events current situations . also take this as a complete question , as i realize that these issues may have been addressed separately( but not together that i am aware )elsewhere on the forum .. have you ever thought you might have highfunctioning autism ? been tested ? researched it ? or do you know nothing about it or simply haven' t had any interest in it ?. this could be a sensitive one , so don' t answer if you' re not comfortable , and i don' t need details sorry and thanks . in your past have you suffered some form of abuse( emotional physical )which you feel has impacted the way you function in your current relationships( if you have any , let' s face it we' re introverts and sometimes get caught up in our work )?. have you been through trauma which you feel has changed your personality ?. if you can' t relate to any of the above points , now is your time to say so . feel free to tell me off for this post , but only if you' re an type( cause i literally can' t handle criticism in any form from other types at the momenti.e . actual logical responses and not selfdefined logical responses are welcome here ) ."
intp,"i ' m an type female in a serious relationship with an type male . we are currently long distance( diff countries in na ). i' ve been in a lot of relationships where i' ve ended up devaluing my partner seemingly overnight , so this isn' t new to me . once i see something that i consider to be a dealbreaker , the relationship feels over before i' ve even had a chance to discuss with them . it' s pretty much happened every single time i' ve dated someone and i think it' s happening again . the issue is that this time , i know that my current type is my ideal life partner . it' s just our circumstances and the lack of confidence in the future that are driving me crazy . he has the classic type career dilemma . he seems very optimistic about everything , and our future together , despite having no concrete career in place yet . he has ideas , and is working towards them , but because those ideas haven' t yet actualized , i feel myself distancing and wanting out . his optimism makes me even more insecure . i' ve always been financially independent , i have supported myself since i wasyears old and have never been anything other than self sufficient . since being laid off due to cv in the arts , he has had to redevelop his strategy for income for our future goals of having a family . he wants to take over his parent' s business , which i think is great for himbut his parents are still running it independently right now. . i don' t have confidence that he will get himself together and be able to contribute the way he claims he wants . it' s the only part of our relationship i ' m unhappy with , but its also one of the most important things to me . it seems crazy to be so doubting about my relationship when all my anxieties are potential issues and not current ones. . we connect in a way i' ve never connected with anyone else , he understands me and is really the man of my dreams . we are eager to begin our life together and start a family on our farm . i do love him but. . love and feelings of compatibility are important to get things startedbut they don' t pay the bills or feed a family . i am being cold and unfeeling , but i can' t force myself to ignore what feels like a massive red flag . our plan has been for me to relocate to him inmore years . i ' m afraid to give up my independence for such a giant what if . does anyone else have experience in this ? maybe not the exact situation , but perhaps an type with an type experiencing the classic type career dilemma?"

infj,hi i am extremely curious in general and i wanted to know if it is also the case ? is it more general knowledge or specific knowledge ? in what subject do you prefer to understand reality?
infj,"hiyo !i found. . a few articles that discussed. . type. . dress style. . i think they' re pretty accurate haha . discriminating visionaries , types seek uniqueness in many things , including their style . their understated natures mean they rarely seek to stand out , although they often wish to find a strong foundation to share their ideas , listen to others and communicate what is most important to them . the type style essence balances this driving need for uniqueness and a unique expression , with the need to be heard and seen for the right reasons . type style essence type perception types rely on a trusted and keenly felt perception that is high attuned to everything they encounter in the world . they hold an inner vision? of most things , but certainly of their style and what they want their style to be , and to look like , and to feel like . matching this inner style vision up with reality? clothing to be purchased in stores , items to be combined in the wardrobe? is often where the type can encounter a frisson of disappointment as the vision can?t always be realized . types create a unique style it?s worth saying again because it is one of the hallmarks of the type approach to style? their need for a unique expression in what they wear . this may manifest in positive ways , such as seeking and finding oneofakind accessories and clothing items that nobody else has ? and in not so positive ways , such as ending up with a wardrobe with many ?orphans ? that simply don?t play nicely with other items in the type closet . i?m listening types are excellent listeners in many aspects of their lives , but this applies to the style arena as well . when they encounter a trusted source? a store attendant who ?gets ? them , a stylish friend who has their best interests at heart , or a professional image adviser who takes the right care with them? they will listen very attentively to the style input they are being given ? and they?ll act on it . some other facts about type style conservative style doesn?t stand out dress to fit in with others have a socially accepted style but still express their unique tastes want to appear put together very fastidious and perfectionist in cultivating their outfits and appearance sources and there' s this. .

enfp,"types are supposed to get annoyed , at best , when people start being clingy with them and become detached and give a total cold shoulder if things get really bad . the books i' ve read say this is because our emotional circuits are overwhelmed with our own lives , but while i can agree with this on the rare occasion i also get annoyed with clingy people when i know i ' m in a very emotionally stable place . i' ve been trying to think why this is for me . i think one of the core reasons is i ' m on a search for self and authenticity . this search doesn' t involve me obsessively tying myself to anyone , so when people do it to me i find it a bit pathetic to be harsh . i know this feeling goes into overdrive when that person asks me to' help 'them with an emotional issue , not being able to get over a failed relationship or dating pursuit is a big one , and when i offer what i know is a solution and people don' t take that advice , repeat the same mistakes , or simply don' t want to do what it takes to get out of their place then i have no time for that . it' s gotten to the point where i' ve ended friendships and , more commonly , told people if they want to talk with me or hang out with me that subject never comes up again ever . any similar experiences ? or maybe you guys totally disagree with me on how i hand these situations."

entj,"isn' t there too big difference between these types ? generally , we don' t use th function too much which means types aren' t really good at using fi while types struggle with te . especially if they are both. beside that , they use a different type of intuition so they perceive the world in different way . i know one type and he is almost always late . notorminutes but evensometimes . besides that , he is more likely to say meh , idc , i ' m too lazy , i' ll go and play games . that kind of behaviour pisses types off . not even talking about completely illogical outbursts of emotions . i understand that opposites attract but is this working to that extend?"

isfp,"i have a known panic disorder that i take medicine for every day . my husband knows this . my car wouldn?t start , not just the engine but the lights , windows , or car doors . i?m already panicking( on an asthmatic day too ), but we try to calm down while waiting for aaa by eating a nice meal he prepared because i put inhours of work in a week period , including a hour sunday and working until am on a weekday . right before we take the first bite , my husband says that aaa can?t help me and that i have to get it into maintenance( magically without a towing company )without any support on his end . i get to the point where i?m in tears . i wait for aaa , they jumpstart , everything?s fixed , and i?m calm again . i come home and he starts ranting about how i won?t let him talk and how i?m an idiot . so i tell him repeatedly to talk , and he just says i won?t let him talk . this happens about five times . then he tells me i don?t have a right to talk . i ask him questions to get him to feel compassion like ?when your dad expected you to know things you didn?t know , how did you feel ? or ?if you?ve had a panic attack before , how would you feel if you had one , and someone told you that because you had one your rights would be taken away ? he told me to eat my meal . i said i don?t feel like it because the point of the meal was to relax me , and he did the exact opposite . we asked each other what would resolve this . i said taking responsibility would go a long way . i get tired of people who provoke at exactly the wrong time and don?t own up to it when they knew exactly what they were doing . instead he said that i should take responsibility for having a panic attack . that just didn?t make sense to me , especially considering how panic attacks happen in less than a split second , so i apologized for not telling him in advance of the meal not to give me unsolicited advice because that was the only thing that would have prevented the whole ordeal . sorry i put that here . i?m just venting and don?t know who else would listen or even kinda understand what happened , as i sure don?t . sent from my iphone using tapatalk"

intp,"hello types !in this interview , i got a chance to talk to yvonne and jessica about their similarities and differences as standard and jumper types . yvonne , the standard type , talked about liking spending time with people and looking forward to it . she also talked about how her masculine ne can see positive possibilities and looks forward to them . jessica , the jumper type , talked about avoiding people and wanting to stay inside her comfort zone . she said that her ne sees negative possibilities which scares her . jessica also talked about fearing the use of her masculine ti to the tribe because she' s scared she will hurt other people with it and consequently get kicked out of the tribe . yvonne talked about having close friends where she can use her extroverted feeling to release emotions and work through it outwardly . yvonne and jessica thinks it' s weird that some people with fi actually prefers to feel bad and stay brooding . the equivalent to an fe being invasive to fi is when a te tells a ti good job when the ti person knows what they' ve done is not up to their personal standards and it' s annoying to hear the te person saying that . watch this interview here"

isfj,"hey types , what' s good ? anyway i want to date this one type girl . however , she is a busy person and puts family , relatives and close friends as her priority . i would not doubt that she is not seeking a relationship at this moment , because she' s had only one relationship before and ended it quickly because of how it separated her from her family and friends . she is catholic and a most likely a virgin . she knows i like her because i asked her out several times , only went on one date . i think i forgot that i ' m dealing with a' good 'girl which made me come on too strong and aggressive during that date , i didn' t get a good reaction from her by doing that( touching her more , subtly putting my around her waist , etc. ). i thought types and types are supposed to be the ideal relationships . what' s up ? did i or she do something wrong ? how do i date her when she' s ready ? what do i do from now on ? if you dated types , leave a reply below . i need some mystical enlightenment"
enfj,"hi all , i ' m eddy , a yearold dutch male , with a long story . i hope my english is ok . i just recently discovered that i?m an type . i ' m not just an type , but an extreme one i scoreon extraversion , intuition and feeling , andon judging . i feel so disconnected from other people , i' ve always been shy and i?ve lived an introverted life . i know i ' m a real late bloomer , which is very annoying . i' ve never been in a romantic relationship , and i feel very ashamed of this . this is just not normal , especially for an extreme extravert like me . i just want to have a girlfriend , i want to feel' normal '. i' ve read all these wonderful stories about type' s on personalitycafe.com and other forums , which give me a lot of hope . i also relate to a lot of problems other type' s describe on this and other forums . i have been visiting a counselor for about four months now , and he diagnosed me with having a severe identity crisis . according to him , i' ve never been through puberty mentally . he said that i ' m an extreme shy extravert , and that i have an type personality . i took some test myself , and i?ve read personality descriptions , and i concur i ' m an type for sure , but an unhappyunhealthy one . i never thought that i amwas an extravert though . i just can' t wrap my head around the fact that i haven' t found a girl . i ' m not talking about' the one ', but just a girl . i' ve seen guys much more shy , more ugly , less intelligent than i am , and have had some success relationshipwise . these guys obviously got selfconfidence because of the fact that they were able to get women . i' ve had a lot of friends for the past ten years . i' ve helped them with a lot of things , even giving them dating and relationship advice , which is quite remarkable considering the fact that i?ve no experience in that department what so ever . why are they not friends with me anymore ? well , they pretty much dumped me , because they are in romantic relationships , and they don' t need me anymore , or i just don' t fit in there evolved lives . it boggles my mind . i' ve two bachelor degrees , and i ' m just a thesis away from obtaining my master?s degree . now i even doubt if this is the right carrier for me . i doubt about everything right now . i ' myears old , and i haven' t reached one milestone of life . no girlfriend( now , or at least had one in the past ), no carrier( to peruse ), no social life , no nothing . hell , i don' t even feel like i ' myears old already a yearold boy must be more mature that i am . i' ve a lot of older , mostly retired acquaintances . they were very successful men and women in their time . i ' m talking about business people , doctors , and artists . i love to talk to them , telling about my problems . they cannot wrap their heads around it either . i' ve been told by them that i?m the smartest , charismatic and promising man they' ve ever met especially this young in age . this sounds great of course , but it makes me doubt even more . what' s wrong with me ? what( simple thing )have i overlooked , or missed ? i have a female cousin from canada . her parents are dutch , and immigrated to canadayears ago . she moved to holland two years ago , she' s now. she is the most beautiful girl i?ve ever seen( i know , she family , so that' s saying something !). she has a canadian bachelor and master degree in neuropsychology , and is also a thesis away from obtaining a dutch master?s degree in neuropsychology . she' s also in doubt if this is her' thing '. she' s been single for her entire life as well . she looks very confident , but it took me just seconds to let my typecharm open her up she cried about the fact that her two much younger sisters and her older brother were( getting )married . she also feels like she hasn?t reached a single milestone of life . she has various degrees , she is very beautiful and she immigrated on her one , so that?s not nothing . i always have great advice for people , but not this time . i don' t understand the problem , let alone having a solution for it . i have the same problem , and i don' t get it either . i think she' s an type as well . to me , it looks like having an type personality is a curse . it just doesn' t work for me , and it doesn' t bring me anything in life( as well as for my cousin ). great if it works for you , and i enjoy reading your stories , but it depresses me too . i hope you can help me . is this an type thing , or is it just me?"

infj,"i have a huge confession to make. . every person that i meet , if i ' m romantically interested in them , or just as a person , i stalk them . never follow to their house , or even want to hurt them . i ' m just so damn curious !i hate it , i deleted my myspace and facebook( besides the fact that they suck )i stalk people , their pictures , their comments , their friends comments . this may be due to ocd , but my god . and on i ' m i' ll re read thingsthinking why ? why? ? why do i talk ? it' s horrible . and also , does anyone ever.well everytime i meet someone of the opposite sex , i think could they be the one ? and it' s like brain !stop thinking ? like , not sexually , but hm , could me and this stranger grow old together. . yeah , i guess this is too weird for even a fellow type . any thoughts ? any confessions ? i won' t judge !

esfj,"hello all , i am looking for advice on managing conflicts between my roommate( type )and myself( type )( i am quite sure of these typings , though you can ask for more details if necessary ). i shall put my central question at the top , just because i might ramble , and it may get lost what do you think i can do to reduce the strain on our relations , without becoming a different person ? i should also mention that i consider my roommate and myself relatively mature( i don' t like this term , as i will mention later )individuals , or at least in comparison to our age group . if you come to any conclusion otherwise about him , i shall consider a failing on my part to represent him accurately . you are free to tell me that you consider me immature . if you do , however , i would appreciate if you explain what you believe i should work on . i begin with the premise that i cannot expect the other person to change , in order to resolve this conflict . to some extent , his behaviors irk me , but i am more concerned about causing him undue stress . for the last two years , my roommate and i have occasionally engaged in prolonged arguments( sayminutes to an hour ). these arguments are almost always initiated by very small things , e.g . i find a statement incorrect or he finds something out of place . over this time period , i have tried to make adjustments which do not compromise my sense of self to my behavior in order to deescalate these conflicts . these attempts have included actions such as preemptively proposing compromises( as a small example , when he did not like the appearance of the multiple paper bags that i left in the kitchen for recycling and wanted to move them all out of the kitchen , i proposed to use a single cardboard box instead , so that people would still be aware that we recycle ). i have not explicitly mentioned my adjustments for one reason i can tell that my roommate believes that i am not trying at all , or not very much . i can only imagine that telling him that i have tried would fuel flames , i.e . there is not really a great time to bring this up . such a belief may have its merits even if i double my conciliation efforts , if they were small to begin with , then the absolute difference could be small even if it feels large to me . gradually , he has become more impatient with my mannerisms . of these , two behaviors seem to prompt the most severe reactions . first , i tend to criticize , rather than praise , and in some cases , he has diminished my concerns, such as labeling a wording implication as just grammar . second , i tend to ask questions regarding his reasoning for acting or desiring action in particular ways and often ask endlessly , because i will simply not understand . he becomes annoyed because he both feels compelled to answer , but also believes that there exists no answer that will satisfy me , and he doesn' t want to feel like he is secondguessing himself when he feels as though he already knows . i tend to have my own qualms with such an attitude because i view knowledge , especially about oneself , as continually open to inquiry . as such , in reverse , most of the explanations which i give rarely compel him i perhaps overqualify my statements to the point in which most of my answers will not satisfy binary questions , e.g . yes or no . i am under the impression that he believes that i am belligerent , masking my intent , or withholding information whenever we argue he has explicitly stated to me that people always want something . i am not entirely sure of the basis of such a belief , since i tend to be blunt and tell the truth , even if it is brutal . i always tell him something of the following that i am curious because i don' t understand it , that my criticism is generally suggestive , or that i want to correct opinions which i believe to be misinformed . i can tell that we have hit a rather precarious point . towards the end our most recent argument , he stated that i was immature and that i needed to work on my eq . i called his former accusation condescending , in part because he claimed that i was like a younger him , which i thought an improper comparison , as our trajectories are entirely different . i am under the opinion that if one believes oneself to be mature , or mature than another person , then one will not be able to learn at all from the other . because he has not apologized , i suspect that he actually believes this statement , which is helpful for me . his latter accusation probably has more merit . he asked me whether there was anyone he could call at that moment and back me up and say that i had good eq or that i had helped them in some way . my response was essentially no i do not feel like i could claim that i have helped anyone nor do i think that i truly understand anyone well enough to understand my influence on them . in general , i also tend to devote myself to my own work , and so i am often not available . i also rarely express my emotions to him , so i tend to give him the impression that i think that emotions do not matter at all . however , i also felt that his standard was inapt , since my prerogative within social situations is generally to be judicious rather than to make people feel better( aka his priority ). i ' m not really sure what to do . i' d like to not believe that our problems are impossible to overcome(of the time we are on good terms ), and i would like to think that we are not condemned to conflict with our particular personality types . we both tend to interrupt each other more and raise our voices a bit when we argue , but even when we argue , i don' t think that we are bitter afterwards . he , however , has mentioned that he feels terrible after our arguments , and i am not entirely sure how to deescalate them . thank you very much for any responses . i hope that i have provided enough information to work with , but feel free to query me for more . i apologize if i am slow to respond."
infj,"an type friend and i are convinced the world is actually slipping into insanity . i?ve gone from being very active on social media a few years ago to completely deleting all of my accounts , swearing off online dating apps , and limiting my internet usage only to learning and productivity . my main reason is because i can?t seem to escape the batshit crazy that seems to be everywhere . people aren?t even thinking three steps ahead . only one . they think about instant gratification and the immediate feelings . never how their actions will affect the future . hedonism and nihilism married to create whateverthefuck is happening on the internet and bleeding out into society at large . it?s terrifying . insanity is the new sanity . no one even seems to realize that it?s happening . what think ? what do ? i?m at a complete loss , frankly . it?s like i?m watching the world fall apart slowly and i can?t do anything to stop it."
estp,"sooo hello energetic people from this group . i have a slight crush on a girl which is an type type( for as far as i went with my research )why am i here ? because i need some clearing about this whole. . thing . i really like her , she gives me alot of energy and she has a really friendly , helpful and specially lovely personality . the only thing here is that i , as an type type w , search for loyalty and steadiness . the loyalty isn' t really the problem , she seems loyal but she is not steady at all . we go to school together and are in the same class( obviously ), but most of the time she is either late or not even coming . this really bothers me as an type being . it makes me question how she is standing in here life . i know types live in the moment and tend to get bored easily and want to live their life to the fullest , but this bothers me almost to the point of where i think' should i even go for this ? 'any advice or tips ? anything would be useful."
entp,"i heard someone define an type as a type that really wants mastery over certain subjects . to be seen as an expert on them . yet in my experience i find that whilst i might have an initial singleminded focus on a subject , that will surely wane , and then for a while i will reintroduce my other hobbies alongside my new one until eventually a new hobbieinterest comes along . as such i become semipassionate about a good deal of subjects but i never achieve mastery or expert level in any of them . am i in a minority to be like this or is this normal for an type ? over the years i' ve done this with soccer , music , djing , poker( inc poker theory ), mbti and cluster b personality disorders( after dating a girl i suspect has one ). i ' m at a point now where i ' m just bobbing between my existing hobbies , no doubt something else will take over my life in ."
entp,"okay , i don' t know very many type females . nt women in general are something of a mystery , since there are so few of us . i was talking to my one type female friend the other day about hormone levels , and it raised an interesting question could type females have higher testosterone levels than most women ? i am very curious as to how brain chemistry effects personality development . it seems that most of the nt women i' ve met are very confident , very sexual and sometimes very socially dominating , all of which are characteristics of high testosterone levels . type is considered a very masculine personality type , and i personally score very high on masculinity on every test . could this actually have a chemical explanation?"
entj,"on many sites i' ve read that types are one of the most compatible types for types , and viceversa . i can' t really say much about that myself , since i haven' t really met an type in person , at least not one that i know is an type , so i don' t really know how that might develop . what' s your experience with types in general ? not only in romantic relationships , but also as friends , relatives , coworkers , etc . do you think types and types tend to get along well ? and as a bonus question , what types do you think are the most compatible with types ? thank you in advance for your time , and i hope you all have a great day !

esfj,"recently started dating an type guy . everything has been super easy and fun . he embodies all the characteristics i ' m looking for . he' s been very openhonest about the fact that he got out of ayear relationship only a month and a half ago . this sends red flagssirensjump ship for me . but he has said , he feels relievedmoved past it because he no longer has to question whether the girl he was with saw things longterm( he proposed twice ). and that he doesn' t date for just hell of it , only if he sees potential he had dated one girl before me and said she was pretty but didn' t care for her personality . to me , this seems way too soon for something to be real . i' ve expressed i do not want to be his rebound , as i' ve been on the receiving end of this before and it wasn' t fun to go through don' t need to do it again . but also , i have tons of empathyunderstanding because i got out of ayear relationship underyears ago so i very clearly remember the darknesshow hard it was . it took me a good yearhalf to heal and completely move forward . so i ' m not opposed to helping him through it with a bit of distance because i understand it . he hasn' t asked for any type of commitment , but we have plans through midnovember already , so he doesn' t seem to be going anywhere either . i guess my question is run and avoid the possible train wreck or stay and hope for the best ? would love your thoughts . thank you in advance !

istj,"i?ve mentioned a girl from high school that i found works high up in the company i?m temping for . don?t know her personality type , but her jobs in finance and accounting made me think of type . a couple of weeks ago , i discovered she works there and came in early to talk with my supervisor privately to tell her i?d like to say hi . she seemed happy to learn of this connection . i was acting mild and genuine in just wanting to say hi . she said she?d pass along the message . no reply . i wondered why . it?s disappointing because this brought back a little nostalgia . we were in the same school from th all the way to high school graduation . i?m closest to an type type . always been that way , but i didn?t socialize much in school . afterward , people told me they thought i?m smart and nice . big surprise they?d know that . this girl might?ve picked up the same . i don?t know why she hasn?t replied in some way . any feedback?"
entj,"if there' s one personality type that i' ll never understand unless i ask someone who has the type personally about how they act and what their thought processes looked like , it' s you guys , the types . i don' t understand why i can grasp every single type that doesn' t have ni as their dominant or auxiliary function , especially auxiliaries , probably due to a lack of nibased knowledge . because i know so little about you guys , i can only really use stereotypes and blanket statements as of now . stereotypes such as cruelly and coldly efficient planmakers , but that doesn' t fit right with me no matter how much i try and convince myself . so , basically , what makes an type tick ? what do you strive for ? how are you like around others ? what' s your take on your extraversion ? how does an inferior fi work with you guys ? tertiary se ? what' s something you look most forward to in life ?( don' t answer all of these , i got a little sidetracked and just kept coming up with questions to ask !)thanks !

enfj,"sanji mbti sanji typevinsmoke sanji mbti type type sanji mbti type is typeone piece mbti types i decided to share my vinsmoke sanji type post here and clear up why he' s a fe dom and ni user in my opinion and not a te user or si user at all . feel free to share your opinions on it down below and tell me what you think . here' s a one piece myersbriggs post on why sanji is type in my opinion . he uses fe and ni and is type and i' ll explain why i think so . so i' ve noticed a lot of confusion with this character . sanji is one of the most misunderstood characters in one piece and i think this translates into mbti as well . i' ve seen him in my opinion mistyped type and type , and i ' m here to argue and explain my opinion on why sanji is a clear type . sanji is not a te user but rather an fe user and uses it all the time in the series . he definitely looks like an si user on the surface but i believe most of that and his chivalry actually solely comes from his fe mostly , and he' s actually an ni user if you look at him and pay attention to his character and actions in the story and series . here' s my argument for why sanji is type . sanji is emotional and driven by his pride and belief system of chivalry and caring for women . he believes in treating women right and expects everyone on the planet to respect and treat all women properly and wants to meet their emotional needs . his beliefs are taught by zeff and driven by his ideals that he grew up with and his personality . sanji cares a lot about other peoples emotions and caring for the emotional state of women especially . he believes women should be treated right and is always serving them and wondering if people and women' s emotional state are good and satisfied . he' s very giving and he' s always asking nami or robin are they ok and if they had enough food or drinks , do they need anything else , just ask and i' ll get you everything you need , this is fe , caring about the emotional state of others and reading their emotions and being in tune with them . sanji has a societal expectation of respecting all women in the world and expects every man to do the same and if they don' t and even worse hurt women in any situation he looks down on them and sees them as less than a man and person . we even see sanji say this in the arlong arc toward korubi saying luffy is a better person than you or the other fishman arlong pirates cause at least he' s not hurting a lady and forcing her to stay with them . sanji is emotional , cries plenty of time , reads people' s emotions , has hearts in his eyes , and is always caring for and asking about the emotional state of others constantly all the time in the series , some might say some of these points in this sentence are shallow simple stereotypes that doesn' t fully prove fe like crying and so on . and normally i would agree , in most cases that that' s not enough i do agree on . usopp is type in my opinion and he' s emotional as hell , but sanji time and time again has proven to be emotional and feeding off of and reading peoples emotions in the series . and he has shown to want to serve other people and help them and their emotional state and to check how they' re doing and desires to take care of them on a constant basis , especially for women !sanji' s fe has been clear and obvious in my opinion , i ' m surprised people mistake te for him when its totally not there i feel , at least in his conscious main four functions . sanji is not logical and doesn' t care about te efficiency and task orientation , he' s structured , helps people stay on task and is organized but he' s not logical and , to the point , and blunt task oriented like te users are , he does it perfectly like fe users , they' re organized and stay on task too just in a emotional way . sanji is always thinking of peoples emotions and is very kind and is always thinking about people' s feelings and emotions and tries to reassure and make them feel better or is looking out for them and their emotions with his decision making in the series . most of sanji' s chivalry comes from his fe , and i' ve come to understand this overtime . examples of sanji' s fe , the millions of times he asked namisan do you need anymore drinks ? are you feeling ok ? are you satisfied ? i' ll do anything for you , just ask and i ' m there . he cooks for them and meets their emotional needs and lives to serve them and make them feel happy . walking up to vivi as ms . wednesday and offering his hand to help her up with his fe manners . sanji stopping chopper and saying , you can' t go after him , you need to understand how usopp is feeling . him putting his familys emotions and needs before his own and wanting to save them and thinking about them no matter how bad they treated him , this is typical fe . of course fi user can want to help others and put other peoples needs over their own , but fe is more known for it by definition in general . sanji put his family' s needs and lives over his own just like an fe user would and type would do in that situation , his panel of him crying while saying that and admitting this too luffy showcased that and all the fe in sanji . sanji says imagine how miserable it would make usopp feel if chopper ran off and pitied him to treat him after losing a serious duel that he started against luffy . sanji is focused on usopp' s emotional state and is thinking ahead on how he would feel if chopper treated him right after the fight , this is pure fe in sanji not te at all . sanji is focused on usopp' s suffering and emotional state in that scene as he says to chopper himself , this scene is a major moment of fe for sanji in the series . sanji helping duval and fixing his face when he didn' t need too was another fe moment and helpful thing he did without asking , he also does this when he puts needs of his crew and protects them by going with bege to big mom , and so on with other examples . sanji also does things for random people and helps no matter who they are , like gin as a famous example and countless other times in the story , which is typical fe , and the gin example also reinforces his fe of nobody should go hungry and i need to make sure they feel good and happy if they' re starving in front of me , he even says ?damn good right !? and gin cries and says yeah and tells him he?s greatful and so on again showing in sanji he cares about the persons emotional state and if gin down to his stomach and heart feels happy and relieved he?s eating and alive after near death starvation experience he just had , this is major fe coming out with sanji here with this line he says and caring about if it tastes and if gin feels good after starving for so long without good food to eat or anything eat or drink for that matter . sanji not deciding to hit kalifa because of his chivalry again was fe . sanji is not an fi user , his values don' t come from within but instead is directed outwards and is focused on society and his view and values of how other people should be when treating women and he again believes all people and men should treat women with respect and emotionally good and well , its a society based expectation sanji believes in , this is all fe in sanji coming out again . sanji being indebted to zeff was fe again and not wanting to leave to repay him . he didn' t judge and cared for pudding and her emotions and compliments her eye even after finding out the truth about her and after everything that happened , fe again in sanji . the list goes on . i used to type sanji type at once point cause i thought he used clear fe along with si to shape him . and i fully understand this typing and concept trust me , sanji definitely looks like an si user on the surface and you could argue some of these examples are si , i fully understand but i think most if not all these examples are fe and sanji isn' t an si user at all even if he looks like one at times . and here' s why he' s isn' t one . i ' m going to explain why sanji is an ni user now since i feel i drove my point home with fe above . sanji is intuitive and we see several examples of this in the story . sanji tells zoro after smoking his cigarette and blowing smoke in the air that do you really believe nami was telling the truth right then ? and then he proceeds to tell him why he thinks this , sanji is insightful and sees things behind the scenes and is always looking at the bigger picture and what' s actually going on behind the surface with things and making connections , this is ni in sanji coming out . sanji is future oriented and idealistic and is always thinking ahead like an ni user would and in that style . sanji uses his ni again when he answers the phone in little garden and immediately says this is the damn restaurant may i take your order , he doesn' t give his name or indicate he' s a pirate to let the other person on the phone he might be someone else or suspicious even when sanji has idea who it is on the phone . eventually he finds out who' s on the phone and fools crocodile that their dead and planned ahead here and made him stop chasing them , ni in sanji . sanji uses ni once again when he made that whole plan with mr . prince to trick crocodile and make him come outside and think he was captured another major ni moment for sanji . he does this once again in enies lobby with his plan , si users are great planners to and strategist but they plan differently based on past experiences and what worked in the past and what' s most secure to them based on what their si knows and picks up on in a situation , sanji does not do this . he always one step ahead of everyone and is planning ahead and is very future oriented with his thinking and the plans he comes up with . his ni planning comes up constantly in the series , the flying fish riders is another example to bring up but i' ll be here all day if i mention them all so here' s all the major ni moments i' ll mention here before for sanji and why he' s a clear intuitive and ni users . like i said sanji is always reading the situation and seeing behind the scenes with his ni as well , he tells chopper in waterdon' t believe a lady when she was lying and always forgive her , showing again just like with nami he sees behind robin with his ni and fe too i' ll mention and doesn' t for a second believe or doubt robin despite her act she gave and knows there' s something more going on with robin no matter how believe robin looked when she rejected them earlier , all ni moments in sanji . sanji is very intuitive and this all explains why and his ni in the series . sanji is also very idealist and a huge dreamer . everyone on the ship has dreams and intuitives and nfs aren' t the only dreamers in the world with big crazy ambitions and goals . but nfs are more known for it and being the biggest dreamers among the temperaments . and sanji' s dream is one of the most idealistic among the bunch . his all blue dream fits perfectly with him being an nf and type . zeff has the same all blue dream too and i type him type but he' s simply a practical sensor sj man with an idealistic dream and he has ne too . sanji' s dreamer side comes out more from his ni coupled with his fe to make him idealistic and sanji is obviously seen as the more idealistic and emotional one of the two since sanji' s face lights up like we saw in the east blue saga during the baratie arc when zeff looked at him and saw how happy he looked , zeff believes in the dream and gets happy upon thinking of it but he' s not as idealistic as sanji and his face doesn' t like up just like sanji' s does when the all blue comes up with his childlike , happy innocent smile he gave in the arc which is more of an nf trait more than anyone else . sanji is also always seen daydreaming and idolizing things in his head , he dreams about women and mermaids and wants to go to fishman island to see the mermaids early on in the series and it comes up over and over again in his mind and through characters telling him more as the series progresses . the amount of times sanji idealizes robin and nami in his head is too many to count , and he dreams of mermaids all the time constantly in the series . also sanji is shown living in the moment fairly well plenty of times and focusing on the task at hand and reacting to and taking in details around him when he' s not using his ni to be future oriented and insightful . and his inferior ti is clear when he does stupid illogical things at times and gives into his fe chivalry over logical inconsistency and what logically makes sense in a situation , we see this behavior when he doesn' t touch caulifa once when he should in this situation and his chivalry doesnt matter as much when robin is about to be taken away and he needs to think logically here and get the key no matter what for the greater cause to save her , but his fe society chivalry values get in the way anyway and then nami hits him and calls him stupid for it . he also shows this illogical stupidity when he lets himself get a nosebleed on fishman island and almost dies , he also gave into his tertiary se by living in the moment and focused on the pleasure he was feeling . he also does this again similarly when he gets perverted and throws himself at women even if they' re bad and obviously an evil shady woman trying to deceive him , showing low ti with him not being logical and noticing inconsistencies with bad women and trying to see their true intentions . he does plenty of times and did this similarly with viola when he gave into his idealism and romantic and idealistic loving nature which is an nf stereotype even if all types have idealism in them . sanji consistently let' s his emotions and fe take over and fails to look at obvious situations logically when he' s infatuated and completely misses things and the truth and logical details he should be seeing if he just tried to stop being emotional all the time and holds back his affection for women which is very hard for sanji to do as we' ve seen time and time again . that' s why i definitely see sanji as an type , hope you enjoyed reading and share your opinions down below . if your curious i type luffy type and will do another post on him soon since my old post , i type zoro type , nami type , robin type , franky type , chopper type , brook type and so on . you can read more about that hear and my thoughts here' s the original sanji type post if you wanna see it this video i also feel does a good job explaining sanji' s character very well "
enfj,"i met an type about a month( i?m an type )and a half ago on a friend app( bumblebff )and he had just gotten out of a relationship a month before . we first went out to a museum and i was surprised by how much chemistry we had . laughter , talking about the history behind artwork , bouncing ideas off each other , getting to know each other . well after that meeting he said he wanted to see me again the next week . so the next week he invited me to his place to watch his favorite show and then go out to get dessert at a french restaurant . he compliments my outfit and makes playful jokes and he keeps staring deeply into my eyes with a big smile . at one point i had to ask ?what ? cuz he just kept squinting and staring at me with a big smile . that night he asks all about my family and asks deep questions and tries to make me laugh . then he offered to help me put together some furniture the next week . fast forward to the next week and he comes over and puts togetherpieces of furniture i needed help with no questions asked . he keeps looking at me smitten and at one point i ran my fingers up his arm when he told me a story about his scar . then the next week we get together again for a stroll , grab dessert , and walk along a bayside walkway at night . it felt romantic . he keeps trying to make me laugh , i poke him at one point and he pokes me back and we talk about how romantic the rowboats are in a pond nearby . we go back to his place to watch netflix but i had to leave early and he didn?t want me to go . we give each other a much longer hugembrace this time and he says let me know when you get home safe . and then quickly says ?i mean so i know you didn?t get murdered or anything. ? and he says he wants to see me again soon . so the last meeting he says why dont we cook a meal at his place . the two of us are in his kitchen close together , at one point i poke him and he pokes me , and he keeps trying to make me laugh . we go to grill on his rooftop and he ends up sharing some personal things about his upbringing and cries so i hughold him . we talked more about our families and upbringing . after we finish eating we go to watch a movie and i ask the question ?can i ask you something ? are just ? friends ? and he brusquely says ?yes. ? so i so okay ? that night i leave a little early and of course felt very disappointedhurt . so i text him ?thanks for grilling , i think i?m getting feelings for you but i know you just want to be friends so i think i need a little break from hanging out right now. ? and he replies ?i understand . i?m sorry if i hurt you in any way.? ? so my question is what is up with his behavior ? did he actually like me ? i?ve never seen this type of behavior with a platonic friend . and also , how can i forget about him completely ? because i?m a bit emotionally devastated."
entp,"idk why my old topics kept getting dug up by you guys but im a different person now let me live mildmannered( imo )kinda slow , cool , chill movements . not dramatic . so i currently am a fan of this model in my country( search brian tran , hes hot )and someone asked him to take a mbti test and his result is type , which seems to fit okay . one thing i love about him is although hes super crazy and fun loving , hes kinda also mildmannered and acts more calm and chill and cooler than his model friends , who just act so much more dramatic and like they have a big ego which he doesnt . so like , are types mildmannered ? cuz thats pretty cool."
isfp,"hate to bother you all out there . but i love pam beasley from the office . i have seen it suggested that she is an type , and i am just wondering if you all think she is one of you."
infp,"hii !a few months ago , i already posted about an type guy i have a crush on and to shorten the whole story i feel like he showed some signals that he might like me( and that' s why i' ve fallen for him , sigh )but when i once asked him whether he has someone he likes( i did that to to test the waters and to make him realize that i do like him ), he said something like no , right now i probably don' t like anyone. ( yeah i wanna forget about that , super embarrassing to me . still , he' s been acting super cute when with me , even after i asked him that , hehe ). but that' s not the point of this post . what drives me crazy about this person is that he often ignores me and replies a few days or even weeks later . and that' s fine , we all have our own lives and replying may be tough sometimes , especially when there are so many topics being discussed all at once . but , gosh , how can you not reply when i can clearly see you' re online ?? overall , it went like this the discussion ened and the next day he sent me a random video but ignored my reply to it and then i sent him pics of clouds( because they reminded me of animals lol )and he sent me short replies so i ignored him just like he ignores me since he clearly didn' t want to talkhe' s started to annoy me with that behaviour . i decided not to message him anymore , at least for a while , and after some time he did message me again and started talking about what he was up to . i think my replies were short because , yeah , he annoyed me. . but then , i started talking more and more and guess what !he left me on read again !halfway into the conversation  ! he literally ignored me while we were still having a conversation  ! i mean , when we first started talking he would take some time to reply and that' s fine , but now he' s ignoring me like thati don' t understand why he' s doing that. . if he doesn' t carewhy is he still messaging me once in a while ? i wish he didn' t if he' s going to treat me like this. . if he cares , why does he do that ?? it only makes me annoyed and i feel like he' s not sincere which makes me like him a little less , lmao . anyways , we never run out of topics to talk about and we' re pretty similar . also , judging by how he always tried to be close to me , it seems that he enjoys my company . is he playing some kind of game with me and trying to make me message him first or what. . and why would he do thati don' t really care whether he likes me back or not , that kind of behaviour annoys me , no matter who does it , because i think it' s disrespectful."
enfp,any reason why types gravitate towards types ? types are either completely quiet or constantly asking questions . they also have a tendency of neglecting other' s emotional needs . so why in the world would types( feeling types )ever consider the stonecold type attractive?
intp,"hello. . i am type , i met a cool girl a year ago on a date app , i liked her a lot but i was broken inside , from my previous relationship , had trouble to open myself , she wanted to see me all the time and i wanted to see her only on week end , stuffs like that. . aftermonths of relationship she decided to leave me , but wanted to stay friends , i said no i could not be her friend , and i tried everything i could to get her back , but didn' t work , she turned cold af . i stopped talking to her formonths and tried againmonths later because she visited my profil on the same date app , we talked fordays but after that she told me , we can continue to talk but , as friends only , i said no and i left again and nowmore months later ,( so it' s likemonths post break up )i ' m still thinking about her , i know its a lot for just amonths relationship. . but i really do like her a lot i tried to talk to her again , she still reply to me , i asked her mbti and she did the test , she is type , now we are talking a bit everyday but she is still cold . i don' t believe i have high chance to get her back but , if i have likehow should i behave with her? she is a military girl , she seems into her carreer alot , and she also had some problem with her dad when she was young , not sure if she has some other stuffs going on , but yeah , she seems to be not very sensitive , at least for guys , i saw her crying for her cat , but didn' t cry for me when she left lol any advice?( don' t tell me , move on , get another girl , iknow that already, just want to know what should i do with her , if i want to have a little chance )thanks! "
istj,"i recently had this incredibly hard situation that led to a huge fight with my husband , and i wonder if you come across the same thing . my daughter started being bullied at school by someone she thought was her friend , and that led her to start lashing out at home . i ' m the goto , hands on person in the family( my husband is type )and usually i ' m the one with the solution for all the problems . i do like things my own way , and inyears of marriage he has learned that the best is just to let me be and let me do things the way i want . but this situation was beyond my comprehension . i wanted to help her , but i didn' t know exactly how , and it seemed i was doing more harm then good when i intervened . so i got into a kind of funk , overthinking every little thing that happened , trying to figure out the best move . i got to a point of not being able to function correctly anymore , and i just dumped it on my husband , telling him that he needs to jump in and do something . i felt lonely , like i was carrying the world on my shoulders , on my own . he blinks at me , surprised to hear me burst like this . he thought everything was fine , that i was dealing with the situation perfectly . he hugged me and told me that since i was always so strong , he didn' t even consider that i was having a hard time . and although i know this is mostly my doing , it still sucks . do you have times like these , when you need help but people around you just assume you don' t need it ? i ' m sorry if my text is messy , but it is still hard for me to grasp it all . btw , my daughter is doing much better now . her teacher was amazing about it and tackled the situation , and with time and some help , my daughter learned to deal with the bullying and now loves school."
intj,"i' ve been wondering about the type of kvothe from the kingkiller chronicles . i think he may be type , but that may only be wanting to claim him . he does seem to use ni rather heavily though . he' s also a bit of a romantic , reminds of myself when using my fi( he' s had a lot of time and experience to develop it. )what are everyone else' s thoughts?"
esfp,"does it bother anyone else that types are generally the comic relief in fiction ? both books and movies alike . i might be biased , because i obviously look at my own more than any other mbti type , but it seems to me , that if someone is shallow , irresponsible , and a kind smiley prankster , it means they are type . there might be some characters , that are typed differently elsewhere , nevertheless. . notably homer simpsonsimpsons philip fryfuturama joey tribianifriends sookie st . jamesgilmore girls serena vanderwoodsengossip girl jonathan carnahanthe mummy samantha jonessex and the city random weasleysharry potter there are plenty . i' ve actually found a list with a bazillion characters in fiction sorted by mbti , and there are a couple better developed ones . which welldeveloped types in fiction are your favorites ? this is the list character listfunky mbti in fiction"
infj,"these are videos so that nobody thinks i ' m triggered or something , but very much rational more focused on type expands a tiny bit on relationships please debate if you want to ! "
intp,well for me anyway . anyone else ? i' ve not been able to make any of my traits into positives or put them to any good use . i wish i was another type . no doubt because i have chronic depression and anxiety . sucks ! 
esfj,"in response to the why people dislike type thread and the backlash that ensued , i felt compelled to start this thread on why people like types , and throw some nuggets of affirmation your way . types discuss the type of qualities people appreciate you for . what are the type of qualities you hope other people recognize in you ? nontype relate a personal story of how an type relationship has positively affected you . what do you admire about the type you know ? notice i ' m trying to relegate this to personal experiences so as not to generalize a whole type . i know all types can be extremely sensitive( my attempt at a joke ). edit fuck !it bugs me to no end that i put esjfs . this was done purposely to demonstrate that even an type can make an editorial mistake , dispelling all stereotypes that we are compulsive reeditors . this post really bugs me now . i can' t even look at my mistype."
enfp,"i ' m interested in writing an type character for a story , so feel free to give your feedback on where such characters have usually been written right or wrong . to be precise , he' s a good guy , very adventurous and open minded but he knows too much about the future to feel completely secure about his accomplishments."
isfp,"not sure if anyone will bite or how this will be interpreted , but i ' m curious to see how types viewfeeltheir internal mental landscape . this is basically like a picture my mood thread , but not about moods , just what it feels like inside your mind or heart in general . your mentality . for example stark . vast . cold . thin . dry . wiry . a bit cornier than i usually go for but it' s something i was just thinking about . if my mind were a place , what would it look like?"
esfj,"okay , for whatever reason i have a question . it?s been quiet forsolid days at work , so my mind is starting to wander back a bit . here we go again . this happened a couple of years ago . i don' t know why i ' m thinking of this now , but whatever i guess . back when i was a student teacher( before i took a break to work , and before i decided to drop out because i disagreed with the curriculum ), i was taking a full course load at my local college . usually , i?d work alone , and during lectures i?d sit in the back of the class in order to draw less attention to myself . my ploy usually worked , and i could usually attend all my classes and do homework in the library without speaking as much as a word to anyone . it?s not that i hated people , i just felt life was easier if i could just focus on what i was doing without anything getting in the way . i moved every year growing up , so generally i just kept to myself . but during a sociology lecture , a girl from the middle of lecture looked at me and waved over at me to sit with her . she looked like she recognized me from somewhere( could?ve been when i worked as a cashier at the mall )but i didn?t know her from anywhere . we started talking . eventually we became study partners , as she would ask me to help her with her homework after class . we would also sit beside each other in the classes we shared together . i believe she was an type . other details about her include that she worked parttime as a waitress , was relatively popular in class( always seemed to know a lot of people ), and she was a former royal canadian air force cadet . she also was in a relationship with another person , so i don' t think there was anything romantic involved( if there was , i was oblivious to it ). the reason i say all of this is because eventually we stopped talking to each other for some reason , and she started to outright ignore me slightly as the semester went on . it started off slow at first , but then it be where she would start to not answer me . i?m fine with this , as she could make any decision she wants and i don?t exactly have a great track record with people in general . but before i could really ask her what i?m doing wrong , i left the curriculum in order to join the workforce to save up for my tuition . we stopped talking after that by this point she is a teacher , and i?m planning on attending a big university and teaching overseas , so i don?t think our paths will cross again . i just want to ask if there was anything i potentially missed to make her behave like that . if there was any romantic implications , then it was likely a missed them entirely . i' ve been asked out a number of times , but my answer was always no . i just want to be in a position where i can take care of that person first , so being in a relationship wasn' t on the table . those were fine , since those people were direct . but there were quite a few times where mutual friends( or siblings )would have to outright tell me that someone liked me , and how they would be frustrated with me for not taking the hints . so while i probably have to work another boring shift , maybe i could get some insight?"
esfj,"i finally met an type !she is really cool !i am an type , and we vibe in a way that is unreal . for the first time in my life , i have felt like someone texts me more than i text them !some traits i notice very friendly and engaging with people willing to speak her mind with no reservations and full confidence no arrogance , just confidence selfawareness of her own inner self diminished awareness of the outside worldperspective genuine concern and empathy( fe )and emotional response expressive texting !lots of exclamation points and i always know how she feels about anything willing to bring up when her feelings are hurt immediately without letting it sit( it was a misunderstanding )able to reflect humor on an even level( first time i' ve laughed well in a long time( still not a hard laugh , still hurting. . but close !))funny in a natural way not seeking it out or going for a punch line very focused on the person she' s talking to where i deliberately use my fe it is effortless for her knows where to get good food( sine )friendly to a level where it can seem like very direct flirting i could go on i ' m sure . i ' m really impressed . i can' t remember a time where i was textedtalked to this much , where i felt like it was almost too much !and i do mean almost !and feel !because it could never be too much !but yeah it' s really interesting how this typetype dynamic is . i don' t even know where we connect when i first met her it wasn' t like anything specific stood out . something , but what ? dunno . but then the next time it was like instant good friendship . i can' t connect the dynamic to anything i know . it' s so different to me . it' s not normal for me , and probably not comfortable to me either . meaning , she has all these ideas to do things and so on , and i am down for whatever , but also the amount is not normal( edit not normal for me )her si in creating sensory things( going places , doing things , etc )is her output of her energy , and i am inferiorse where i can only handle so much before i feel like i hit my limit . it' s so cool . writing this is just helping me sort out my thoughts . i can tell now , that all the sensory input i' ve been getting( long , frequent texts back and forth with all the alert sound notifications , audiorecorded messages she sends , going places and planning to do other things )is a lot for me to take with my inferiorse . i can handle it , but also at some point my head is stuffed , my se full , needing no more input . so i need to find a way to ensure i properly recover inbetween hanging out , and to limit my sensory exposure during those times , not indulging in anything sensory , instead keeping it like a trickleintake where when i do fill up my se , it' s at the end of the time spent hanging out and then yeah there' s still gonna be a lot of texts after lmao. . so yeah. . lol. . it' s just good . anyway , it is awesome to see this personality type in person for the first time( consciously knowing it )and all the dynamics . very direct , enjoys listening to other peoples 'stories , gives great practical feedback and so much more . the si is probably the most interesting component , because it( si )creates sensory experiencesgoing places , doing things , and so on . i ' m not used to thissi is the function i' ve had the least exposure to before . i ' m just pulled into doing these things , willingly , but also like i cannot help it !it' s so strange because i haven' t had that before , mostly dealing with se users . so yeah it' s like. . alright we' re gonna do this thing this week !and there' s no stopping it , it' s like an excitement or a wave that cannot be stopped . and the textsaudio messages !i try to be as deliberate as possible in responding inkind to everything i can , and it' s a lot !i still have two audio messages from a few days ago i still need to catch up on , and that' s so unlike me !but yeah . lots of exclamation  ! lol. . so yeah . type you guys are pretty cool in my book."
isfp,the same way the vibes are relaxed friday through sunday . it?s a real thing right ? i swear the atmosphere used to be much better when people weren?t on these so much
enfj,"hey guys , i was just wondering what results you guys have gotten if you' ve taken the firob test."
istp," ( posted this on reddit as well )fellow types , im on the verge of finishing high school and the idea of going to another place to sit down and do work formore years is. . not what i feel like doing . my grades throughout high school have been solid d' s and fs . i really have no idea what it is that i want to do with my life . i got into coding for a little bit and for a while was dead set on going to college for computer science , but sitting behind a desk is also not what i want to do , as i literally do that everyday already . i think i want to be involved in something where the action is but i ' m not sure what. . how did you guys deal with the tremendous pressure of life after high school?"
esfp,"hullo there types so today i kind of had a , well , talk with an type friend . it started out light but got deeper and ended up with her crying . basically , i was trying to help and see if she was able to improve on something she didn' t think she could improve on . no it wasn' t a intentionallypushyourbutton thing , but somehow i managed to get her thinking about everything she' s suppressed inside in an attempt to help her deal with those issues . and then she started tearing up for a bit?not sobbing but blinking tears . on the other hand , she didn' t actually try to stop the conversation , in fact , she went and continued deeper into it and then couldn' t control her emotions . i realise that types do indeed subdue all their negative emotions inside because they don' t want to burden others with their problems . i also realise that this repressing is unhealthy , but it' s not like you guys can help it. . or can you ? after all , mbti doesn' t contain us in a box . my real question though , is how you comfort the type in that situation . obviously , bringing up the matter in a logical manner does not work at all?been there , done that . talking about emotions don' t work?it just revolves around the same issue . i can' t simply leave the room and let her cry by herself either , because i already know that she' s crying and therefore the imaginary' burden 'is already on me . so what do i do?"
istj,"hey there type' s . i ' m curious about the following what makes an type feel guilty ? does it take a lot for you to feel guilty ? what are some things that people have said done that has made you feel guilty ? whether you were wrong or not . thanks everyone , i apprecite it"
isfj,"i find that i often take little things that happen , connect them together , and create something huge out of them that is not necessarily representative of what is actually happening . and because i am rather impulsive , i act out on my intuition only to end up regretting doing so later on when i see things more clearly . so fellow types , how can i get myself out of the smoke and mirrors before it' s too late and i lose sight?"
isfp,"i wonder how easy it is for types to be selfdisciplined . i can see how types would be very selfdisciplined about following their own values , but how selfdisciplined are you when it comes to completing tasks and reaching goals ? in mbti , types are seen as people that procrastinate quite a bit . types are seen as live and let live people . in socionics , types are seen as disciplined and hardworking moralists( if you believe that the jp switch always occurs for introverts if they are typed correctly ) ."
isfp,"hii ' m new here , but completely fascinated about personality typing . it has really helped me as i try to navigate online dating after divorce . i met a very nice type man online in may . i am type . we texted for a month . i was into him right away because he was so warm and funny . i even asked him out , and he said it would be fun but never followed through . finally after a fullweeks he asked me to get drinks . we shared all the details of our lives and really connected . when i got home he texted that he hadn' t wanted to leavei hadn' t wanted to either . the next night he came over and i was so into him  ! he seemed to be too as we quickly started a relationship . i got to know everything about his life as he talked about hisolder kids(, , )nonstop , along with his job . we dated forweeks and had a very passionate connection . he gave the best hugs ever . they literally made me catch my breath . every time he came over my house or we did something nearbywent for dinner or for a hike . but , he never invited me to his house . he claimed he didn' t want to because it was messy , but i assured him i didn' t mind .weeks past after i initially brought it up and he still didn' t invite me over . btwhe lives in a very nice neighborhood( much nicer than mine )and told me exactly where so i could go there if i wanted . it' s not like he was actually hiding anything( as some of my friends have assumed ). so , when he came over my houseweeks ago i was upset and a little angry . i told him that i didn' t understand why i wasn' t important enough to him to let me into his life . as i spoke he was staring at me so intensely i was scared . at first i thought he might cry , but then it was as someone said( in another thread ), a sort of defiance . he said , i ' m obviously making you unhappy , i ' m just going to go . and , he just got up , said goodbye to my cat and left . i messaged him an apology the next night after i cooled down and he replied the following morning with a very nice response about there being no hard feelings and goodluck . but , then he blocked my phone number , texts and even my ability to find him on facebook( we weren' t even friends there ). sorry so long  ! i ' m desperate to understand this . in our conversation i was really sad and frustrated and expressed that , but something i said seems to have offended him or made him cut me out completely . i just don' t understand and i can' t get clarification from him . any insight would be appreciated . i didn' t want to break up with him , although i did question our compatibility . i at least want to be friends after the intensity of what we had shared . can you provide insight into this?"
infj,i hope so i just took the jung functions test and i am type. . i rarely get that result on the personalities site . i usually get type or type . so now i am type so deal with it . intuition gang  !  
entj,"i need to quickly switch back to motivated , ambitious and intellectual mode . could use some type advice with my internal motivation to move past very unambitious period of my life . recent stressors include incompetent collaborators , terminal disease of a close friend and some standard bad careerproject choices , with general depressing covid situation , which is also affecting mobility for work travel . i am having difficulties deciding if i should go abroad( two countries are on the list , both noneu , while i am eu ). i am leaning towards the ?average ? project and higher standard country , closer to move there , to make it easier for myself . i feel that i would otherwise criticize this project when it would be just the project . the other position would be more ?tough ? in terms of change , but intellectually very interesting , rewarding and includes a very good mentor . at the same location , same salary , not a difficult decision . could be that i am secretly preferring one location( familiar city as i lived there before ). but could also be that i am lovering standards and lack ambition , i definitely feel uninspired lately."
esfj,"hello types , i am running an art project and would want to get a lot of people involved !my current interest is to discover true personalities of people because in reality , we really don' t listen all the time . it is easier to place judgements and conclusions on others when they speak . this is my third experiment and i would like to collect peoples 'respond to this question are there something you have always wanted to say out loud to people but thought it' s not worth tellingnot importantwill be laughed at ? kitteh hope to hear what you think ! "
istj,"types , why don' t you like type and type ? you are often so rude for us , why?"
esfp,"i am driving myself nuts freaking out about this , just want to get some insight from you all please . this is regarding a suspected type . we were both travelling , and had a chance encounter . when we met , he said up front that he is a busy person and is not at a stage where he wants a relationship . he also said that he desensitizes himself when hooking up because he does not want to get feelings . regardless , we hit it off so well . he was only in that country for another two days and wanted to see me again once more before he left . i went to see him the next day . we spent hours together , talking , getting to know each other , we clicked so well . we hooked up too . the next day he didn' t want me to leave , and hung out with me all the way until his flight . the entire time he kept lamenting of how he wishes so badly that we could spend more time together , how our situation is such a horrible shame , how he wishes he could know me , take me on a date , he said feeling this kind of connection with someone is so rare and he is so upset that we can' t pursue it further and see where it takes us . i didn' t say muchi didn' t want to get my hopes up , so i just kept my mouth shut about it most of the time . this was all him , he made a comment about how sad he is literally every hour . he even said he is starting to change his mind about his aversion to being in a relationship , because of how i made him feel . he also said that he would not want to desensitize hooking up with me because although he cannot say he has feelings for me right now , he would not mind getting feelings for me . then he left , and we kept in touch . for the first week after this , he was still on vacation . i did not want to get my hopes up , so i assumed we would just exchange a message every now and then , and intended on just keeping it short and sweet . but he kept continuing and prolonging the conversation , and kept messaging me , which indicated to me that he did want to speak on a regular basis . so , i went with it . for a few days , we talked all the time . he would message me commenting about his day , and asking about mine , and vice versa . he also sent me flirty messages saying he wishes he could cuddle with me and stuff . he even said that he plans on coming to visit me next time he has a vacation . then his vacation ended and he went back home . around this time , things started to change . he didn' t message me and it was mostly me messaging him . also , the flirty messages gradually decreased.he didn' t message me saying i wish i were laying with you or anything anymore . personally , i feel the tone became more friendly( but that could just be me ). then , after a few weeks , it got worsesometimes he would just not respond to some of my messages . i asked him why is he ignoring me , and he said sorry things have just been really crazy lately . i waited a bit and it didn' t improve . so i sort of confronted him . . i basically told him i want to talk to him about something and to let me know when he is free . he said he is free now so to tell him what it is . i said that' s not what i mean . . he hasn' t been messaging me like he did before , when he was on vacation , so to let me know when he will go back to being free like he was back then when we used to talk all the time . he said he is always busy so the next time he will be free in that sense would probably be when he is on vacation again . i said okay fine i' ll tell you now , and i basically told him that i felt something special with him and i want to wait for him , until he comes to visit me . he said our vibe is great and we can still hang out , but he can' t promise to be committedalways be reachablehave time for me etc because he is busy and does not want a relationship right now . but he is okay with keeping our vibe as is . he also said that he wouldn' t mind being second if i end up finding someone more suitable to where i am in life first . he said he is not looking for anyone right now , but if he was , then the same would apply to him too . i said that' s fine with me . ever since that conversation , we exchanged just a few messages . i initiated twice and he initiated once( although i am not sure whether his message to me was sent only to me , or a group message he sent to others too ). i will clarify what i am looking for i ' m okay with not having a relationship since it seems unlikely to work due to distance , etc . but , i do feel something for him , and i would like to have . . i don' t know the word.a romance with him ? is that called a fling ? basically when we see each other , we can be romanticallyphysically involved and have a passionate affair , even if only temporary until we go back to our separate ways . what i am freaking out about. due to the change in the way he talks to me , i fear he has lost interest in me . but i don' t want to sit here heartbroken if it is not true.that would be unnecessary suffering . but i also don' t want to keep hoping it' s not true when it is . so i ' m stuck .. i am unsure whether whatever we have is what i described above( what i am looking for )or if it is more of a friends with benefits type thing . i do not want a fwb , that is very different from what i want . i do not want us to just see each other as platonic buddies , and nothing more , and just use each other physically . i want the romantic attractionconnection too . i would not be okay being involved with him if it is purely physical fwb type thing."
esfp,i would like to know what you guys think of the types.
infj,"my mom , she is a supplement chaser . it annoys me because probably. of these supplements are not backed by science or anything rational . it' s like she just has this feeling that she must keep trying and using different supplements , even though i doubt any of them are helpful at all . then there' s this type doctor i know who , seems to also be a supplement chaser . she is a fitness fanatic who participates in triathlons . ok , that' s fine . but she also seems to be attracted to using unfounded supplements . and i have seen her say some questionable things online . i don' t remember them all at the moment , but for example , i remember she said she is glad about the placebo effect or something along those lines . i find this annoying , because that is what a quack would say . placebo as a treatment is completely useless at best , and is potentially harmful."

infj,"hello !i amand currently about to enter my third academic year at a university . my major is english and , like most types and many english majors , i keep flipflopping on what i would like to pursue careerwise . back in my seventh grade civics class which was taught by a spunky older southern lady who sang songs about the government and told stories of her adventures on the nude beaches of france i decided for a short period of time that i would like to become a lawyer . now , after being convinced for years that i would become a literature professor , my mind keeps venturing back to the idea of a legal profession . reading and writing will always be my passions , but something about the idea of teaching literature in a college setting doesn' t quite scream i ' m helping people enough for me . now , i know what many people may be thinking most lawyers are just after the money , even if their work is unethical . i am only interested in criminal law( and maybe environmental law , but i have little knowledge on the field ), and i am only interested in becoming a district attorney that is , i would be working for the government to prosecute the criminals and fight for the victims . it is the whole justice for victims notion that really grabs me . this is the kind of law that i( think )i would feel good about doing . of course , there are times where the defendant is actually innocent , which troubles me greatly however , i do not know how likely this is to happen , assuming that the district attorney' s office only takes on cases with a wealth of evidence . i feel i have a knack for problemsolving , a way with untangling words , a drive for doing right , and a persuasive presence under structured settings . i have never heard of an type attorney , however , and i always secondguess if i know what' s best for myself . am i just unrealistically striving to be like marcia clark ?( who , i know , lost the case and was scrutinized for months but she still fought with everything in her for justice ). will my feeling trait make me too susceptible to the harsh realities of law ? any opinions on the matter of types as prosecutors would be greatly appreciated !

intp,"hello . i had a small group in university with few guys . only me and other person( call him mr.v. )left standing at graduation( which i skipped ). he was awkwardly shy . i always feared girls , so did he . he wore glasses and small beard with mustache , looking like a man( even like a young professor ). he seeked company by me first year , then we both warm up to extraverted girls . you might even start thinking he' s an type . the main issue he was great untill the first serious exam( mechelec physics ). he started whispering prayers and had a mini icon( orthodox christian ). i noticed that he was incredibly silent when asked an abstract question . we had weak girls in our group , one assistant trolled them by asking question fromweeks ago , they didn' t remember . mr.v . had a great memory( not genius , but on my level ), however any unrelied to the daily subject question or a task made him literaly sweat( maybe even panic a bit ? ). it was something like he' s very limited of processing the meaning of things . i tried to explain the logic behind exercises , and he appreciated my help( on last grade i shared teacher role sometimes to keep myself entertain ). while he might have been attached to me , i never liked his company . he tried to approach the conversation with me or a girl on a fun note with a joke , it usually was like an awkward scene from a teen movie . is there fundamental conflict between me and mr.v ? or i am just very smart and it has nothing to do with personality ? hope you liked putting a thought into the case."

intj,"sasuke uchiha( type )naruto myersbriggs types sasuke typenaruto mbti typings sharing this with perc as usual . here' s why sasuke is type and let' s explain his ni in the danzo fight . sasuke in the danzo fight constantly read between the lines and thought ahead in the future in the fight with his ni . sasuke had a hunch and predicted with his ni that danzo' s arm and sharginan eyes were the source of his power and that when all the eyes closed his power would end . he thought this was the case and said it out loud and made him confess and tricked him to admitting it . he also knew that stamina was key in the fight from the start and that trying to last out the fight and spend enough time for his jutsu was stop was key and important as well he knew and suspected with his ni , this planning alone from the start was clear ni in him and again him seeing patterns and reading between the lines with his ni as well on suspecting the eyes closing would end the power . madara narrates all this and how far ahead sasuke was thinking the whole scene and explained all this and how much sasuke was using his ni in this fight with danzo . sasuke is a classic type and ni dom and this is another reason why . sasuke is type and not type at all and never lives in the moment and doesnt care for details like se is known for . sasuke is a te user and is logical and cares for efficiency with his te , as soon as he beat danzo he wanted to immediately go to the leaf village with his te efficiency and take care of business , se does also get impatient and wants to do things yes but sasuke clearly uses te all the time in other scenes too in the series , he was always telling his rogue team we need to keep moving and stay on task with his te and cared for efficiency all the time and always wanted to keep the group on track . he uses his clear te in plenty of other scenes as well in the series in both partand partof naruto . sasuke has clear fi and its strong but no dominant , his fi is tertiary which is high enough , his inner feelings and values drive his as a type and help his ni and te move forward and want to execute his values to avenge itachi and his clan at all costs . he uses se inferior and hates being in the moment and prefers to think of the future and think ahead and read between the lines of things beneath the surface with his ni , but despite thise sometimes he does live in the moment and focuses on details around him when necessary and racts to them accordingly , sasuke is a classic se inferior user who hates details overall and prefers concepts , ideas , and meaning and thinking of the future . that' s my sasuke type analysis today from the danzo fight , tell me what you think . i' ll post my other sasuke type post down below as well here' s my first sasuke type post here' s some other sasuke type posts here here i ranked sasuke in my type anime characters tiermaker"

entp,"the song satsified with lyrics the song satisfied is one close to lmm( the author of the song )' s heart because being type he is never satisfied . angelica is an type and hamilton is an type . they share ne , seeing all the possibilities in the world but they also have low dopamine , the neurotransmitter responsible for focus , passion , and contentment in the brain . when it comes to sexual encounters , dopamine levels are highest early on in a relationship and then they plummet . whereas the type will stay in a relationship likely due to having empathy for their partner( with an occasional affair here or there ), the type with poor empathy will stray more often seeking out the new high , confusing pleasure with happiness . unlike other types who have normal dopamine levels( or types who have above average levels and often are satisfied ), the type and type , who dissect their environment with razor sharp clarity , wonder what is wrong with them . why can' t we be as content as other types ? why are we never satisfied ? while it may seem than i am poking fun , we have higher dopamine levels than you do  ! , god has made us different not better . low dopamine levels mean fewer heart attacks , strokes , and better physical stamina but a higher incidence of parkinson' s disease and indirectly dementia . types have the opposite disease pattern . i am almost jealous as to how easily i can speak to types and types and tell them how best to lead their lives . you will never be as satisfied as other types , but you can at least prevent being miserable by paying in one way or another others to do all the things in life you can' t stand . the secret in your life is to focus only on doing the things you most enjoy and not doing those that you don' t . keeping stress levels low prevent the type and type from seeking out the unhealthy dopamine thrills . for us types , the wine , woman , and song so often touted as the slogan of our type has not left me satisfied . of course , it was fun trying it out"

infj,"the death of the friendship as a once living thing in its own right , which is how it feels to me . i just finished a short story about mytype exbff and i . i?ve never written about it before and writing brings some clarity , but definitely not all , just enough to ask more questions . i have been trying to understand what broke us up for aboutyears and mourned that friendship the whole time . i have listened intently through the years for clues as well as consulting my exfriend as many times as i could stand to and she was willing . we have minimal contact at her choice and i only bother her with a text for christmas and usually birthday . what happened was typerelated or bound to her being type and me being type . it wasn?t something that was due to her individuality , not so much , i would say . i recently heard an type youtuber , joyce meng , talk about the break up of her type best friend it was also brutal . she said her type had given her so much love that she hoped in her lifetime to ever find it again , but ? obviously she was not planning to repair it . she did see the breakup as a failure on her part , an inability to accept the love her type was giving her . on another youtube video i heard her say the following( paraphrased )?an nfp will want to support you in being an individual , but i don?t really need individuality . it?s cute and sweet , though.? ? discussion point. this lack of a need to be an individual andor the lack of a need to value oneself as an individual , it seems to me , was the cause of my best friend not valuing my individuality and not understanding or valuing how i valued her individuality . on a few things , yes , she was grateful that i could see how much she liked something , but mostly my bestie easily forgot about any value i placed in our individuality bonding( the way the two individualities connected ). for instance , a few years ago she had no recollection that we have a favorite author in common . even though we had seen every jane eyre movie available and had stayed up late talking about jane eyre and charlotte bronte many nights during ouryears being best friends and living together in college . i gave her both shirley and villette( charlotte?s other books ). she was surprised a few years ago when i sent her a link to a documentary on jane eyre?s influence in how people view romance . she said ?wow !i will really like this . jane eyre is my very favorite book ! ? ? i said ?good im glad you like it !? and i didn?t say ?ii know . i know everything about you ? because it would have been rude in context of her not remembering something so basic about me and me and her . i was so shocked she didn?t remember anything about what we used to spend so much time over . like ? does she even know me ? dear types the above is likely going to sound creepy or obsessed , maybe it would blow your minds to know that the nfps who love you in your life remember most anything that is truly individual about you ? and they always will ? that is just normal to nfps . i thought everyone was like us , i wouldn?t have even thought anything else . the lack of memory is the shock to us . how can she not remember ? discussion pointi?m also going to say this ? i don?t think you guys experience friendships as almost an entity of their own , but this is kind of how i think most nfps experience the synergy and feelings and memory created between people . it?s got its own life . and death , apparently . my story is a tombstone on what feels like a zombie grave . lol . okay , next . discussion pointone of the things i also can?t understand was how easily influenced she was by who lived with her at the time of our friendship?s death . it wascousins who had their own agendas . they didn?t know me , but they loved manipulating her , from my perspective . because she told me that they wanted her to get rid of this old friendship with this extrovert who wasn?t her cousin . she told me this , then said ?what should i do ? j had been sitting there listening to her story thinking surely she was telling me this hurtful tale in order to tell me how she had told them ?respect my friendship choices , i respect yours. ? or . ?we?d been friends for years , you should get to know her. ? or ?ypu aren?t the boss of me. ? because i was absolutely shocked ? why would anyone ask someone they cared about to give up a friend ? come to think of it , she asked me to give up my oldest friend , an type , because she saw her as ?shallow? ? i said ?well , maybe that?s how you experience her , but she?s my friend and i love her. ? anyway ? what should i do ? she asked me . i do not manipulate people and i was extremely confused . if she can?t even say the smallest word to defend a friendship she has for years where we were so close ? i thought she must be telling me she didn?t care about me very much , and for all intents and purposes that was true , maybe ? i said ?do what you think is right. ? like a supportive friend would , in my mind . now?because i heard joyce meng say that being an individual isn?t what she needs?now i think her being persuaded by her cousins?maybe all due to her lack of valuing herself as an individual ? and her inability to value both the relationship and me ? so when i talked to her back then , when it was obvious that she was conflicted between her views of me and her cousin?s views of me and was choosing their side , i tried to understand and find peace with what she was choosing versus what we had shared( basically everything )before . i said ?maybe you needed me more when we were living together and maybe now you?ve got your cousins ? she just looked guilty , i don?t think this now . i don?t think it was need , but just less people bossing her . before that , before j moved out and her cousins moved in , we also had a talk where she said ?do you want to know my negative feelings ? would it make you trust me more or less if i told you so that you knew i am aware ? i said i would trust her more because if you?re aware you can try to avoid hurting someone . she then said she got very jealous of me( i was dating ? she wanted very much to date , but i don?t know why that has never happened for her . she?s cute and very worthwhile , of course . it is my stance that she doesn?t quite understand her role in starting it up. )and after i got married and had kids , she is somewhat bitter ? but i don?t know how she frames all of this in my mind . i think it?s a lot , though . also i think she ? i don?t know . she says she can?t stand to hear things about where i live because i live by the ocean and she says ?don?t tell me , you have that too. ? both times i needed to mention where i live . but she is well off and fancy free ? she could live wherever she wants . whether she sees it that way is different . i thought she is in what i call a ?type complacency rut? ?( whether you guys know or relate with what i?m talking about is questionable for sure , though.im not going to say i am an expert on that or if that is even a thing. ). she told me the relationship with her closest cousin kind of ?died ? too , so j don?t think she lives where she does to be close to her sister . i think she likes her job okay , but also seems bored and drained by it , like many people . somewhat recently she talked to me about her dad dying and i know i am one of the few people to understand her relationship with her dad( and probably to care and see her as an individual , since her siblings usually mostly have her serve them . the one sister who i think sees her as an individual lives further away . anyway , i offered to call her again so she could talk more and she almost bit my head off . ?i don?t have time to give to that.? ? the way she said it was like i was wasting her time listening to her ? i don?t know ? idon?t think i?ve sent more thantext since . it seems obvious she was hurting , but also like she values my tiimr and effort pretty close to dirt at this point . again , i know she was hurting , but my big questions are always ?how do you really feel ? the truth ? because the truth about her own feelings about me isn?t easy for me to figure out , and that makes it hard for me to know if she needs me or if she would love for me to be gone . it seemed lou?s and clear for once ? even though ? it looked like she needed me for once that night . but( ckk okmjng full circle here )if her individuality isn?t important then ? probably nothing i do or value with her is important and ? there you go . the zombiefication of an typetype relationship that had years of feeling and meaning on one side that will never really die?and on the other side no meaning , no life , nothing current or future and therefore not really existing for her . when we were at our closest , i was dealing with understanding that my mother is not to be trusted , also my twosisters . so i think i was used to being told i wasn?t important . i know i felt like people would hurt me because there must be something wrong with me and i must be annoying and people kept me around due to their kindness.i thought and all that has taken me years to get over , but not entirely because i have a father who loves me to pieces and me all of them and so there were things i would handle differently now , and of course i wasn?t perfect . but i am a fun , loyal friend who always wants the best for people and i am supportive . i think i?m just saying this because i think my value for myself now would have somehow influenced her differently if mg selfvalue had been present then . also , instead of being shocked , i might be able to voice my expectations and yeah , she probably would have valued me more . i don?t know ? i don?t work like that , i don?t think?well , i won?t know?and there are enough regrets here already . lol dig deep and see what you have to add . where do you relate to my friend ? can i get more understanding ? i actually don?t think this is individual , like i said . i think it?s the opposite if you guys really dig into your own psyche , i?d be thankful . discussion pointi guess one more thing , because maybe this thread will be the last flower boquette that i place at this tomb ? when she said?one day ? after i had given a type of impromptu speech at a church gathering ? that that day she saw me as a ?power house , like what my dad always wants me to be . i thought you were above me and that everyone was below you at your feet listening. . my dad always talks about power houses. ? she was not being sarcastic , but very sincere and wanted me to take the complement and she wanted to discuss . then i thought she meant that she had seen something in me to value , but that day was a turn for the worse . who doesn?t want their best friend who loves them to be wonderful ? i hadn?t thought any of that to be a big deal. . but maybe with what she said about her dad ? i didn?tmeet her dad more than twice and he hardly spoke to me . it?s not like we were rivals . i think i?ve seen you guys saying something about thinking people were above you ? but she can?t have reallymeant that with how she often looked down on me too ? right ? or maybe she didn?t look down in me ? maybe she was just impatient with me wanting her to value her identity ? lol . anyway , that discussion happened right before i moved out to go to get my master?s degree , if she was feeling like the moving out would be painful , then that might be a reason to find a reason distance herself ? if you guys focus on anything , let it not be this . do the other discussions first because ? this one seems dumb to me , but still a piece of the puzzle of how she viewed me and our relationship . by the way ? this might all be stuff too personal for me to share about someone else , but you all don?t know her . this is not someone on perc and i think it would be a shot in hell for her to ever find this discussion . so let?s at least do some learning ? because it sounds like maybe there are more zombies in the graveyard . and maybe for some of these reasons."
istj,"so i have taken a test today on my learning style at work and it appears i am a' theorist '. there are four distinct learning styles or preferences activist , theorist pragmatist and reflector . these are the learning approaches that individuals naturally prefer and they recommend that in order to maximize one' s own personal learning each learner ought to ?understand their learning style ?seek out opportunities to learn using that style theorist these learners like to understand the theory behind the actions . they need models , concepts and facts in order to engage in the learning process . prefer to analyze and synthesize , drawing new information into a systematic and logical' theory 'theorists adapt and integrate observations into complex but logically sound theories . they think problems through in a vertical , stepbystep logical way . they assimilate disparate facts into coherent theories . they tend to be perfectionists who won' t rest easy until things are tidy and fit into a rational scheme . they like to analyze and synthesize . they are keen on basic assumptions , principles , theories models and systems thinking . their philosophy prizes rationality and logic . if its logical its good . questions they frequently ask are does it make sense ? how does this fit with that ? what are the basic assumptions ? they tend to be detached , analytical and dedicated to rational objectivity rather than anything subjective or ambiguous . their approach to problems is consistently logical . this is their' mental set 'and they rigidly reject anything that doesn' t fit with it . they prefer to maximize certainty and feel uncomfortable with subjective judgments , lateral thinking and anything flippant."
entj,"just curious how you got into the relationship you' re in now , or a relationship you were in . types aren' t the most loveydovey , so every story of them falling in love is fascinating . i' ll kill for the details !go ahead and write all of your mushy , cheesy stuff . even if you' re not an type and wanna share , share anyway !i' ll start march we met in trigonometry class . we weren' t that fond of each other . my type was very reserved and a little socially awkward , while i was more extroverted and gregarious . we talked briefly because the teacher made us talk in class . it was small talk in the group about weekends , spring break , etc . in short , painful . june we started to skip the small talk as our group is comfortable with each other . he started goofing around a little more . i liked him as a friend and invited him out for lunch . our school had an event , and i convinced him to try the cowboybull game thing . i asked him out lunch again after finals the next day. . but he couldn' t go because his grandpa had a stroke and he had to go to the hospital . it suddenly pained me like a knife , and i started questioning why i even care . the next day i went to vietnam for the summer . we texted occasionally and video called twice . i panicked because i couldn' t get him off my mind the whole summer . when i got back , my friend canceled lunch , so i asked him instead . it started there , and we started seeing each other everyday between classes . he started opening up and i realized i' ve fallen in love with him all this time without knowing . his friend asked if he likes me , and that' s when he realized he does . that weekend , he sent me a text at midnight saying he wants to tell his parents about me , because he likes me and he' s willing to take risks to be in a relationship with me . i told him i want an unofficial relationship for now , but told my family about him anyway . he' s going to tell his family this thanksgiving . yes , i ' m scared lol his friends call me his halfgirlfriend due to our unofficial status . we' re committed , exclusive and really supportive of each other . i can' t wait for the date i can openly call him mine . i love him so much ok , your turn . now. . go !

isfp,"dear all of the type brothers and sisters , i come from eastern country and my english may not be so good . hope that you could understand what i am saying and thanks for your help sorry for telling you a long story . i could call myself type or type because i seem to have these two personality characteristics .i met a type girl one and a half years ago . i amnow and she is. she hadn' t had a relationship before . we have been chatting within this one and a half years . i know that she is introvert . she likes doing her own things . she will reply me more in a day when she is going out as she uses her phone outside more . if most of the day she is staying at home , she will just reply me, times . last year , i tried to ask her out . we went out and had a dinner about once inmonths and sometimes watched a movie . most of the time i paid for the dinner and i saw her safe home every times . she is not good at socializing . she does not have much friends but it must be enough for her . and she has almost no male confidants but i don' t know whether she trusted me as her confidant . i know she will tell her confidant only if there is something serious or a secret to her . for example , a big disease on her family . and she will tell me about this and i will comfort her if she needed . in july , in a date with her , i asked her whether we could get together . she hesitated for a while and finally agreed that . i know that she is the person that cannot be push . i had asked she agreed to date with me because she also had feels on me , otherwise she will not chat with me for such a long time . therefore , i also agreed that i should move on slowly . in the first week , although she still replied me, times in a day , i could feel that her words were at least showing that she is in love . we had been dating once per week and kept it forthree weeks . in the second week , she knew that her family member had a serious disease and needed for take about her and she told me that she needed to worktimes a week ,day for taking a rest , and the rest of time she needed to take care her family so she cannot date with me . ok i just said a few times about find me when you needed me and asked her whether she was busy , if not we can talk to each other more so that we can understand each other more( i found that i was wrong at that time ). in that week , she replied me much less and not adding emoji on the replies . suddenly at the end of the week , she said that she wanted to break up , she told me that we are not suitable for being together and being friends will be better . she said that she felt stressful and we were in wrong feeling . i struggled fordays and agreed with her . i was very depressed and thought that why all of my efforts on her are useless . after that , we only chatted once per day in snapchat as i don' t want to push her anymore and hope that i can wait for her . one day , when i talk to her in whatsapp she just blocked me and she didn' t reply me in snapchat anymore . i am afraid that she will block my snapchat also if i find her . i really love her and i didn' t want to loss her . i knew that evenyears oryears or more , i may also want to wait for her . i want to ask for a few questions .. do i have chance to get her back in this situation ?. what can i do in thisyears ? not chatting with her but showing her that i am still care and love her and she won' t feel that i am pushing her ?( seems difficult ). i has asked some of my type friends , and watch the post in this forum . does types will have their mind change when they have big changes in their lives ?( as she thinks that her personal life is import , watching entertaining program and taking care about her family is important. ). does types easily have relationship to the one who have been friends for a short time ? as she has very less male friends , and neither one will understand her in a such deep way .( i am not talking about i understand her very much as she is really mysterious ). thinking about this , will i have chance in the future ? thanks for reading such a long story . hope that you can help me . more information can be provided if needed."
istj,"so i was going to post this in the rant thread but figured maybe it needed it' s own place , because it' s really bugging me . i like rules . apparently this makes me a freak or something . especially at my work , but also in organizations , in politics , even on the internet( but hopefully not here right ? ). i feel like it sets me apart because there are clearly people who think it' s fine to create arbitrary unreachable rules , and when no one follows them they don' t care as long as the rule is written someplace . when i want to make the rules better to change them to match what we' re doing , people ask if i ' m bored or crazy or something . i don' t believe in rules because i ' m an angel , i ' m not out here telling kids to say no to drugs or protesting radio stations that say bad words on the air . i like rules because i feel like they save people time , you don' t have to reinvent the wheel . if everybody just stared at each other wondering who should order food next at burger king wouldn' t that be awkward ? but there' s a line and we all stand in it . it' s not oppressive , it' s smooth . so you should look at what the rules are , be familiar with policies , know what people are doing , to save yourself some trouble . you should document reality . rules should be brief , accurate , and helpful . it' s really important to me and i hate hate hate people acting like they don' t have time to read rules or don' t have time to make them better . i think if a process is broken and you can change it , you should . it' s worth it . it' s important . if the process is stupid , like if you have to submit a form to ten different people , then dammit i ' m going to submit that form to all ten peopletimes in a row until they' re annoyed enough to finally tell me they don' t all have to see the form . if a rule works , i ' m going to follow it , i ' m not going to throw out something that works to make my own thing just because i ' m too lazy to read the existing rules . i hatepage employee handbooks , stocked full of everything anyone has ever wanted to wish for new employees , but no one has ever cared to enforce . i hate how in atlanta all the speed limits are, which is so ludicrously low everybody just throws it out and drives. i really hate it when companies say you can' t mention us in social networks but the ceo has a linkedin page with the company logo and he' s connected with half the damn company !it' s been really hard for me this past year to judge whether i ' m being overbearing and annoying or whether i ' m doing something important , bringing up my feelings when someone is ignoring rules . do they think i ' m crazy , or am i doing them a favor ? the other thing that' s hard for me is trying not to hate people who make up stupid rules that they don' t plan on enforcing . maybe that should be a personality difference i should just appreciate , but i see it as a flaw , i can' t help it . so i' ve yammered on enough on this , but anyone with me?"

isfj,"hi all , i ' m hoping you can give me some advice on dating . i ' m fairly new to the game and signed up for online dating aboutweeks ago and it' s not going well . the site matches me with many attractive women , but almost all are incredibly active working out most days and many are rabid sports fans watching every game of their chosen team . i share that because my lifestyle is the exact opposite far more relaxed , stay home as often as i go out , not comfortable with the bar and club scenes. . typical type stuff . i am also the typical type personality outgoing and adventurous( to a degree )but perfectly happy and enjoy staying home watching tv or doing other stuff there , good listener , neither dominant nor submissive to others but , rather , prefer a partnershipie , i will never order food for another adult . etc etc . it almost sounds like i ' m trying to start something here , ha !do you have any dating tips for an type man who isn' t constantly prepping for the next marathon or the big game this coming weekend and doesn' t want to dance the night away or make all the decisions ? from what i can tell on this site , that' s all that women want in a man."
entp,"as an type i am incredibly interested in an type i have known for seven years . recently after a lot of effort i broke out of my extreme fear and admitted to him that i had feelings for him and informed him of my fears that we had developed an emotional affair . i was told that he doesn' t have feelings for me but still wanted to be friends even though it was weird to him that i thought we had developed an emotional affair . he has a wife who really isn' t emotionally invested in his life but has a son who i know he loves , because of this i told him that i was afraid that i would be greedy and create a division in his family life as i was afraid that i was going to drive a wedge between him and his wife which would lead to a divorce and i told him that we can' t be friends any more because of this fact . my question is , given the context of this situation and my extreme efforts to not manipulate the relationship as best as i possibly can , do you think it will become to expensive for him to keep wearing a mask ? my type friend constantly projects gay slurs and i have a strong feeling that he' s more open to a relationship than he is capable of producing at this point in time because of his family obligations . thanks !

estj,"i' ve know him for over two years . we' ve been official for approx .months . we have long standing problems related to not being able to have fluid conversation because our interests and ways of perceiving to world are so different . i know that this is a huge problem , but i don' t think conversation is everything , either . for example , i can talk for hours with an type or type . that doesn' t mean i want to be with one . hell , i' d pay to have those types kept away from me . so despite our communication issues , we admire each other a lot of connect so well physically . i like that he' s solid , brave , good hearted , and rational . he likes that i ' m dreamy , sweet , and playful . we are both stoic and have somewhat lonely , sad paststhough he' d never readily admit to that . in a lot of ways , i was attracted to his tragic personae . i needed to unravel it . reasons he gave you' re going away to college(hours away ). you might meet someone . i might meet someone . i ' m old and wasting my time . you' re young and i ' m wasting your baby years( he doesn' t want more kids , which i understand ), it' s only a matter of time , and now is as good as time as any other . i am sad it' s over . i hate that he wants to end things out of fear for the future . he actually said that . i ' m scared for the future , lola he gave me my christmas present , which was great , and we cuddled for hours before he left for work . he was so compassionate while breaking up with me . he almost cried at one point while i was crying . he says he still want to be friends and promised to visit me in the city once a month or so . he even said he wants me to spend this christmas with him as plannedgo to his house an visit him( his son will be with his exwife this christmas ). he said , when you come in from the city on weekends , let' s watch movies . should i play things really cool ? distance myself and just be his friend ? is he in disaster mode( he just moved )? what does it mean when an type says i don' t know what i need.?"

istp,"as an type , do you find it hard to recognise and categorise your own feelings ? or is it harder to understand how others are feeling?"
enfj,"we needed one of these . tongue you know you' re an type when. sometimes you think you' re too happy for this world , so much that you have to try and tone down your enthusiasm for fear of appearing insane .. you feel like you could never run out of love for people and are amazed by how much you could care for each and every one of your friends .. you get confused when people doubt your love for them even when you' ve showered them with more attention than anyone else .( ahem , types. ). you laugh too much. . and sometimes get in trouble for it .. people are surprised to find out that you' ve got a little bit of depth to your personality . wink. your music taste is all over the place .. there are some people in your life that you hug every time you see them , and you don' t know why. .. when you get emotional( both happy and sad ), you speak a tad metaphorically .. people quote you .. people somehow relate your presence to abstract things such as sunshine , lights and stars .. you love sending your friends mail .. sometimes you smother your loved ones with so much attention that it embarrasses them , and you just think it' s funny .( examples of an appropriate time to do this is at birthday parties. ). you just go overboard in general . that' s all i have for now . your turn ! "
isfj,i' ve been mistaken as an type by others but i also deeply relate to a lot of the type profile . i love art my art teacher in high school suggested i go into fashion design but that' s just not really typeish despite my love for style and aesthetic . i know we can' t fit ourselves into the box of our mbti type we can deviate based on our upbringing and life experiences . i just find it difficult to accept everything that is said within types descriptions on various websites . i feel like they should be more accurate and all encompassing. . but maybe this is just my introverted thinking acting up . thoughts ? what do you think about the various descriptions on websites about types ? could you see yourself as another type as well?
estj,"i just wanted to say hi and post this article from celebritytypes for all the types . enjoy !david keirsey nicknamed them ?the supervisors, ? and their stereotype in the jungian community , as far as i have seen , has been the insufferably traditionalist , inflexible and hardnosed disciplinarian who taught your sixthgrade algebra class . this is clearly an unfair depiction , but those who try to give a more desirable description of the type often just describe a shortsighted and unambitious type . in this piece i aim to describe the core of the type profile and the typical type as an individual just as capable or incapable of becoming a hero of the history books as any other personality . to begin , let?s break down what constitutes the type functionally . they are a judging type , meaning that they prefer extroverted judging and introverted perceiving . this means that they base their judgment criteria on objective outside information , while simply observing and drinking in their subjective information and experiences . you could say that they are more aggressive towards the outside world and more receptive towards their inner experience . their preferred way of doing this is through extroverted thinking and introverted sensation . extroverted thinking is inductive . it forms conclusions based on objective data , which they then aggressively try to fulfill . meanwhile , introverted sensation perceives reality as it is , but invests its perceptions with subjectivity and recalls these subjective memories in similar situations . it is recording , or if you like , cataloguing or recalling . third , they are very similar to the type both prefer te and si . the type , however , prefers te more than si . nevertheless , they are in some sense the same type , or at least sister types . i personally like to call stj types the ?scientists? ? because they thoroughly examine reality and compare it with all the past experiences they?ve collected in their database . they then form logical conclusions from this breadth of objective data . of course , ?scientist ? is merely a nickname to help me remember the stj nature it does not mean stjs are more likely to have an interest in actual science . the type , then , is a ?scientist ? for whom the objective data and its resultant conclusions hold more sway than their subjective perceptions . they are more concerned with fulfilling their obligations than with recording and exploring information gleaned from reality . as such , the word i like to use to encapsulate the type nature is ?responsibility? ? as far as i understand it , the core element of this personality is the inductive formation of conclusions about the world essentially , they develop a worldlaw or formula for how things logically must be and then seek to live according to this law , as not doing so would be illogical and nonsensical . in other words , they form conclusions from objective data and then feel obligated to live according to those logical conclusions they have a solemn responsibility to do so , so long as the conclusions remain sound . they do this despite any inner , sentimental protests they may have . their inner sentiment is repressed and seen as a weakness . the world law must be obeyed no matter what it only makes sense to do so . as such they feel that they ought to be held completely accountable for all their actions , good or ill , reasonable or flawed . nothing will get done in their favor unless they hunker down and produce , working according to their understanding of the world . in other words , ?stick to your guns ? and ?you reap what you sow. ? once they form a conclusion they ought to stick to it , accepting full responsibility for their actions , reaping whatever they sow by their brilliance or incompetence . they also expect the same responsibility of others and get frustrated when people pose sentimentally charged arguments , excuses or sob stories , which they perceive as the cowardly or petty avoidance of responsibility for their actions . it?s now easier to see where the stereotype came from they can appear hardnosed and disconcertingly strict or harsh . although , most types , as with any type , do not submit to their preferences pathologically . a typical type isn?t going to go about shoving their formula down everyone?s throat . but they will naturally take the perspective that people ought to stick to their guns , reap what they sow , suck it up and not fall back on sob stories to excuse themselves , even if they don?t go broadcasting this opinion or consider it an essential part of themselves . on the other hand , the type may purposefully express their opinions in as bigoted and offensive a way as possible . this is an expression of the type?s tertiary ne , because in this situation the type knows full well that their statement will be offensive to people . they state it so offensively in order to make fun of those who can?t handle the truth , while they just as easily could have stated it in a more politically correct way . i make mention of this as an example of the often unnoticed clever , multifaceted ne side of the type . they are by no means narrowminded , humorless , backwards disciplinarians . on the contrary , they have a tertiary perception of future possibilities and multiple facets of an issue , despite how their dominant te may make them appear . underlying their personality is the cleverness , innovation , and cognizance of a typical ne type . finally , it is important to mention the adverse effects of their dominant te . this causes a repression of the fi function , responsible for forming judgment criteria based on personal , subjective values . as mentioned before , the type strives to keep their logical obligations despite any nagging sentimental protests . its repression also extends to how they view other people , as they find it difficult or aversive to give any weight to others ? personal values . this is why they abhor sob stories , because it?s an expression of personal feeling and sentiment , and such feelings are repressed under the importance of keeping one?s obligations . they may find it difficult to empathize with others or understand what they?re going through , because they naturally believe that objective data ought to hold the greater sway for things in the world to go right . so , in summary , the type is responsible , submitting to their logical conclusions , expecting nothing less of themselves and others than to get down in the dirt and produce without whining about it . underlying it all , they have a clever and innovative spirit and humor . unfortunately , they have trouble recognizing their own or others ? personal values and feelings , making it difficult for them to empathize with others and more likely to deeply offend them or mow them over . thanks for reading , and for all the types out there thanks for trying to keep us on the straight and narrow . watch this piece as a video here . click to expand."
enfj,for all you typeers out there !on a scale fromhow. happy are you ?. socially skilled are you ?. lazy are you ?. emotional are you ?. book smart are you ?. cocky are you ?. fun are you ?. goofy are you ?. sensitive are you ?. humorousquickwitted are you ?. self aware are you ?. likeable are you?
isfp,every person that i' ve ever known that was type was quite difficult to get to know . they seemed to be very sensitive and really kept to themselves a lot more than the other introverts . agree ? disagree?
infj,"types , why do you ask people so many questions ? !to understand how their brain works and how to deal with them lol ? curiosity?"
esfp,"i have an type friend and she' s interested in this type guy . she was wondering if this would work out because she thinks type' s are the male version of her . which they areexcept less feelings . i told her to go for it . she' s still skeptical and thinks he might end up not working out with her . so , do you think this pairing could work ? i messed up on the title , i know . ignore it."
istp,"as an type , whenever i am in presence of other people or in a group project , i pop out and no body ever notices or calls me out . harder for me to pop back in , but still consistent with the air of irrelevancy . i find this useful for getting past guarded and monitored areas . hell , other people don' t even know i am in the same room as them . now , i ' m wondering if this is common with other type and due to ti and se not being verbal functions( as in not having a basis in discussing ideas like an intuitive would ), correlating with the air of irrelevancy . of course , i ' m not implying that this is exclusive with types . rather , is it common with types( and them being really good at it ) ?"
estp,"is it just me , or do you guys tend to reverse idealize people as well ? i have a few bad experiences with someone , and then i start to think that they are no fun to be around , they are always like that , etc . then i bump into them again later and they really aren' t that bad . some times they are actually fun to be around . anyone else have similar experiences?"

istj,"hi , type' s !i have an type friend and we have known each other for aboutyears now . i have always felt like he never puts in as much effort as i do to maintain contact . most of the time , i have to initiate phone calls and invitations to hang out . when we do speak we have enjoyable conversations that can last quite a while and we have fun when we do stuff . but why does he not initiate more ? is this common with type' s ? thanks."
istp,i dont know much about functions but from what i' ve read online i think im in a tini loop . so basically im home all day everyday stuck inside my head and when im thinking about stuff i suddenly get these realizations from nowhere and automatically think i ' m correct . does that sound about right ? how do i break out of this?
esfp,"there' s this common belief that' s been bandied about on type' s that we magically are the only people who if left alone in a crowd of complete strangers , we' ll just magically emerge with a shit ton of new friends , never the worse for wear . maybe that' s true for type' s in general ? but for me it' s been bothering how much i hate approaching people to talk to them from out of the blue . at my job it' s easy . i can chat and entertain totally strangers all day and never once feel self aware . but there' s just something so scary about looking around a room and realizing everyone is there in a group with someone else and feeling like this rouge outsider with only so much time to try to garner a laugh out of them to let me join themdo any other efsp' s know what this is like ? or am i just having a string of bad first impressions ? i still love crowds . i absolutely get the energy from a crowd . but these days i feel more comfortable just getting lost in the chaos , and feel far too self concisenes to approach anyone."

istp,"type femaletype malemore than friends with benefits !long distance( lots of things in our favor here)we talked daily and slept together formonths . i read all the post about how to tell an type is into you and he fell in line . he shared personal things with me , spent quality time with me outside of the bedroom , initiated contact , sporadic bursts of emotions , went on adventures . i respected his space when he needed it and didn' t flood him with my feelings . we were great . same sense of humor and actually enjoyed each others company . we said from the beginning that it was just casual and both knew that no relationship would come of it . shockingi caught feelings . i really wanted to continue like i didn' t but i knew i needed to tell him . sooooo i did . he ended it and said that we had to stop because he didn' t have any romantic feelings towards me and that he wanted to remain friends but we needed to stop communicating . i have read a lot about types but is it honestly realistic to be in a beyond friends with benefits relationship formonths and havefeelings ?

enfj,"hello beautiful creatures , my story begins upon meeting an type a little while ago , we became good friends , albeit with little to no chemistry . however , i did notice him paying close attention to what is considered normal by our general society , and noticing how people would view his actions . that definitely didn' t sit right with me , as a rebel to all that is normal , but i played it off my mind like a champ . not until he commented on my recetlyacquired highlights with what would people think ? my question is this do types let other people influence their actions?do they base their actions on what is socially acceptable by many ? thanks in advance , hope someone made you crack up todaywink"
entp,"so i am ayo type . been interested in this girl( also type ). i felt she was very interested in me too , she was always eager to talk with me about everything because i would impress her with my wits and how ambitious i am with my goals and what i like etc and she really liked that . i was doingof the talking and she doesn' t mind . the typetype match is very interesting but also exhausting . the thing is afterweeks of seeing each other regularly i told her that i liked her . she told me that she likes me too etc. . but was not interested in being in a relationship at the moment she just got out of a serious relationship and it was taking too much of her time . when she told me that i purposefully said okay you' re not interested that' s too bad and disappeared and stopped talking to her for a while . she came to me after a while and brought it up again and started overjustifying why she doesn' t want to be in relationship . the thing is i am interested in a romantic relationship and not something else . need a bit of advice here."

entj,"relationship question , but i felt it deserved a thread of its own . pretty straight forward question why did you break up with someone ? was it something they saiddid ? was it a particular way of being ? valuesprinciples ? no future ? i thought it would be very interesting to get the input of fellow types on what would be considered to be a' deal breaker 'which actually was a deal breaker , after you' ve entered some kind of relationship with someone else . this thread is different from your regular' deal breaker 'one as in this instance , you are being asked about someone whom you' ve known for a while , but not completely , and only after some time have you came to the realisation( or perhaps you knew from the start , but refused to see it )that the relationship was doomed for a reason or another . for reference purposes , it might help if you could identify the mbti type of that( ex )significant other and the amount of time for which you had been dating them . it would also help to include various details such as your personal age , the type of relationship it was , whether it is was a heterosexualhomosexualbisexual relationship etc. . i' ll start with myself . typemonths , your regular heterosexual relationship it ended in a ldr , which is not a problem in itself , except that it actually made me realise how stupid( as in , complete lack of intellectual depth )he was . i got bored , and the fact that he was a lazy sonbornwithasilverspoon with no critical thinking skills or direction in life was the major turn off . plus he had a micropens . i considered it a waste of time to continue with the relationship and the fact that i was actually very busy education and career wise made it very easy for me to put an end to it . i might include other relationship' feedback 'depending on the participation of other fellow types . please don' t use this thread to vent out about failed relationships . the aim is to see whether there is some correlation in the way types approach relationships . i must add that in most casesas commonly pointed outi' ve had no difficulty whatsoever on not looking back at the( ex )significant other . sometimes though , i wonder whether my failure at relationships is a common theme , if not in my life , in the life of types generally . hopefully this will get people talking"

istj,dating an type for several months who?s going through a long period of stress at work . we have a long history of several years but this is the first we have really had the opportunity to date . several relationship stressors occurred during a stressful time for him at work and he asked for space though he acknowledged i have been a great support to him . he wanted time to just get through work before the holidays . instead of fighting him i insisted he take more time to figure out what he needs and wants with me and with work but also told him how much i do care . in our last conversation he assured me he cared for me too and wants a long term relationship otherwise he wouldn?t even be engaging at such a stressful time . he said he didn?t find it totally necessary to have zero contact but i think was relieved to get some distance . we have had some light texting but not everyday . in this day and age of ghosting and general lack of integrity in dating i can?t help but worry if we will ever talk again . what?s the chances this is just an type in stressswithdrawal mode who will come back to me versus a permanent breakup ? so much thanks in advance !

istp,"hi guys , i ' m an type female who has been with her type boyfriend for more thanyears . it' s been pretty good? we' re obviously very different people in the way we process things , but there' s a lot of love there when things are good , we' re affectionate , giggle together and have the same sorts of morals and world views . lately we' ve been arguing a lot about the same things over and over , always money related . just wondering if i could get your views on what i can do to improve the situation , as i know he thinks i ' m really critical , and i probably am? me and my sister say that we didn' t have a great upbringing in that sense . our parents argued a lot and were very critical of us and each other , and my mum always used to say' don' t be a doormat ',' don' t let your partner walk over you ', so i think that' s in the back of my mind a lot . we have different views about money . if i ' m able to save even a little bit in a month , it gives me a feeling of security . when i get paid , i pay whatever bills that need paying as soon as i can , and i have a few different accounts that i divide things between . i ' m not super ambitious , i don' t spend that much , i just want to be comfortable( mortgage on a small house , in a cheap part of the country , couple of weekend breaks in a year? nothing fancy , don' t think i ' m very materialistic )and i have an idea of what i need to earn to achieve this , and am happy if i make more than this . i ' m selfemployed , so i guess i have to be quite driven to make sure i earn enough . i ' m also really transparent about my earnings , when i ' m struggling because someone hasn' t paid me , or whatever . it' s all on the table . no spreadsheets or budgets or anything like that , i just like to keep on top of it . i was single for a long time , and i guess when we started dating , i was excited at the thought of like , two of us working as a team , saving a bit together , building something together . and we do do that in some ways , don' t get me wrong !we' re both into decor and have made our house our own , he' s super handy and has done bits of diy , and we' re slowly fixing up the garden( again , mostly him , except i get new pot plants from the supermarket from time to time , lol ). but he' s not interested in the' doing finances together 'thing? he doesn' t like me asking about his finances , he doesn' t share anything with me . whenever i ask about it , he gets really angry , but if i don' t ask about it , things don' t get sorted . like currently he has a situation where he owes money for a venue he teaches a martial arts class at , because the admin woman hasn' t raised an invoice . it' s been going on formonths because she is clearly crap at her job , but he hasn' t chased enough? and because he hasn' t set aside money from his earnings until recently , he has a large amount to find when she finally does send the invoice , but he has a parttime job so it' s going to be a struggle . i could help with things like this if he' d let me , i ' m happy to make phone calls , send emails , whatever . i also suggested he set up a payment plan with her to make it easier for him , but he listened to all of that and then just said he' d pay it all over a couple of months . he doesn' t want me involved , so i just sit there worried about how he' s going to find that money , and how that' s going to affect both of us financially for the next few months . that' s the thing we' re arguing about the most right now , and i' ve reached the stage where i ' m just not going to mention it again , because his position is firmly entrenched and i don' t have the energy for it . i don' t even want to come across as critical ? ? the way i see it , we' re all good at some things and not others . i don' t tell him that although he' s much better at diy than me , i' d prefer to do all the plastering myself ? this feels the same to me? i feel i can help and improve the situation , but he' s been in enough similar financial entanglements in our time together that somehow i feel he actually wants that ? is that a thing ? i' d love if you could give any advice about how to approach this.is it just a case of accepting that this is how it' s going to be and giving up on my idea of financial teamwork ? i see advice online like' schedule in a time to sit together and talk about your finances , draw up a spreadsheet ', etc etc . none of that is going to work , as the more i mention it the less likely we are to have a civil conversation about it !thanks for reading !hope you can help !

istp,"hi , all !there' s a man who is talking to me on a frequent basis , and from my interviews i' ve identified him as an type . he confirmed his type by reading and agreeing with the descriptions of types that can be found on the internet . i' ve was over at the type forum , and there is a thread there that gave me the idea for this thread . so , to types and those who have insight into this question , would you please give examples of type behavior when an type is interested in someone for more than sex . also , i' d be curious as to how that behavior changes after an extended time in a relationship . thanks !

entp,"do anyone else , particularily aiming to types ( but do share if you have anything to add regardless of type !), have problems with onetoone conversations ? i feel like i can walk into any group of people and socialise enthusiastically and with confidence no matter how large the group or how well i know the individuals . but talking to a single person without the company of anyone else tends to turn out pretty awkward for me , unless it' s businesstalk or with a friendfamily member i know well."
istj,"that grey area of misuse of company resources . i' ve done it . when i was younger . but now i regret it . mainly because soon i learned i have so much more to gain from a reputation and inner sense of deep integrity . now i ' m dating this type , and this wonderful person( beautiful , mature and well balanced )confessed to me these very small corporate sins such asmisuse of company telephone .brought home an abandoned company garment . for me these acts are a little puzzling . should i trust this person ? looks very open and sincere toward me , now . or could it be a red flag?"
estp,"ok i posted on the type forum about being in a relationship with an type , but i am now convinced he is an type . i know typing isn' t everything , i just wanna make an effort to understand him more . honestly this isn' t going well . he is being possesive and keeps probing me about past relationships . he also never talks about anything but us . about our relationship and about sex . we are in a long distance relationship and i like to talk about sex too , but i feel like we never talk about anything else . we never talk about his day , what his opinions on anything are , or just have a random conversation about nothing . i am very attracted to him but i am beginning to think that' s all there is . is this normal for types ? what do you usually talk about with people you connect well with?"

istj,"please help me understand my new type frienddate so i' ll know where to continue . i' ll try to make it short . i have for a long time been infatuated in a woman i met as a doctor when i had serious illness . i waited a long time with contacting her because of that( half a year ), and in the beginning i was also not sure she wanted my friendship . although after several attempts , she opened up and we got closer , and texted now and then and also met a few times . the last time was really nice . she talked a lot about herself( instead of being so private ), her life story , her dreams for the futureand i felt we really hit it off . she also told me she doesnt have a network outside work , but that i was special for her in the way that she wanted to get to know me . after that meeting she also initiated texting herself and i was sure everything was going ok . although , for me out of nowhere , she stopped texting in the middle of a conversation . it was like this she i hope it goes well for you tomorrow( workthing ). i will be thinking intensly about you me thank you so much then i didnt text her after the workthing( which i guess she expectedstupid me tried to be a little hard to get. . , wanting her to ask me ). then the day after that she how did it go yesterday ?( for me this message sounded cold since she usually starts with my name , smileys etc ). me thank you , it all went perfectly( blabla. ). how are you ? and then stop . didnt hear from her in three days . i then texted to see if everything was ok . i actually started to worry . she answered as if nothing that everything was fine . then me , really stupid , got sarcastic back at her , telling her that she might want to treat a new friendship better , and that if she could be a little less of an idiot in the future , i would make her something nice . before she could answer , i told her i was sorry calling her an idiot , and that i did this because i was sad she didnt give me a reply and that it was just easier to call her an idiot instead of saying just that . her answer was so cold. . she i am ignoring your yesterdays text . i guess you already know it was far out of line . she again i answer my texts when i can . me telling her i was really really sorry and that i was thinking a lot about her , and hence my expectations of her answering me sooner , but also stating that i of course could not claim that of her . and thensilent treatment. . it' s been one week now . we had been planning to go for a hike these days and i am really sad for things turning like this . can someone please tell me what she is thinking about the situation and what she needs from me ? should i now respectfuly keep my distance or does she still want me in her life ? is the silent treatment a punishment or just her way of processing ? btw , i am type, we are both female"
intj,"i avoid forming a real identity that people know me by , in case i decide to use a different one . there have been sites that i' ve made accounts for on multiple occasions because i end up deleting them for the sake of completion , then later want to come back and make new ones . i don' t say anything to people because it' s more organized not to say anything . or more specifically , i don' t say anything remotely personal or revealing about myself , i keep it very impersonal . i try to remove people from my life rather than try to maintain connections , unless i happen to be interested in them at the moment . i usually unpack right away after resting to prevent having to unpack later . my diet is extremely narrow . i have a few staple foods which i keep large amounts of in order to prevent running out , and only eat if someone happens to cook something . i can' t remember the last time i cooked for myself because it' s easier to just satiate my hunger with a staple food . i have separate barefoot and shoe zones to avoid getting my feet dirty , ever , that way i don' t have to wash my sheets , pillowcases , and covers . i wash my hands after handling objects that may have a smell or harmful chemicals . that way , i can smell my fingers and touch my face without a worry . i wash my anus with water after pooping to avoid the hassle of using a large amount of toilet paper , and wipe my pee off in case there' s drops . my room and electronics are very plain and without personalization . backgrounds can sometimes have a rule of thumb , but since life can' t be summed up with a statement , in the past it changed and recently , i just use blank backgrounds . and now for the p aspects , or what seem like them i rarely shower unless i go out . i just wash essentials . body odor doesn' t bother me . i can sleep with sheets without washing them for such a long time that they discolor , and the covers develop a strange smell , probably because i learned that ejaculating in them is harmless and the covers can just be turned over . i sometimes lived a hermit lifestyle surrounded by big piles of garbage because other things mattered more to me . it' s only when i developed goals that the garbage hindered me in that i got motivated to clean it up . i greatly neglected and ruined my teeth because i felt they didn' t matter at one point . i also had digestive issues that needed attention , but i was too focused on other things and ignored them . i missed many important dates because i was too focused on other aspects of my life as well . i can seem very disorganized sometimes , and that' s usually because being organized isn' t a goal for me at the time . my floor outside of the barefoot zone is very dirty because i don' t put objects on it , just walk on it . my toilet is filthy because it' s not like i drink from it . i have no aesthetic problem with things looking gross or broken , and likewise i don' t feel anything good from a cleanlooking environment . i like things considered gross in a sexual context , possibly because they boost the rush , regardless of what is actually being done or its actual significance . if a woman doesn' t bathe , the excitement i feel from that makes me overlook the fact that she smells bad . my t side the ends always justifies the means . if my goal is the greater good , then i can do very bad things to others , and to myself , in the pursuit of it . i don' t show my emotions unless they benefit me somehow . i feel uncomfortable with things that stir me emotionally because i don' t want to be taken aback and sidetracked . i give no legitimacy to my own human side , unless that in particular is the goal . usually , i ignore my human side in the name of nihilistic beliefs or goals in my life . i can be completely lazy , if that' s the goal , or drive myself to burnout in pursuit of one . my n side i spend a great deal of time thinking philosophically , determining what my goal should be , rather than pursuing something . if i create a relationship with someone and it doesn' t suit a new goal , then it becomes a hindrance . so i avoid creating obligations to people and avoid working . in the past , i could study dilligently at times , but it was more than offset by the times that i was sidetracked by things that i considered more important . although i thought my social life was important at times , i could not really connect with people due to being so onedimensional and focused . i only managed to have shortterm sexual relationships in women , in which i had very frequent sexual contact . but once i learned that they require commitment in the long run , i left them . my i side i dislike talking to people because of how complex they are , so i often fantasize about doing so . however , in reality , i don' t actually reveal anything about myself , so i end up being an empty , quiet guy who for some reason puts himself in the midst of people without having a good reason to do so . this especially applies if my goal happens to be social interaction , but again , people only get to know my shell because people getting to know the real me is something that would make the slate unclean . after all , nobody is perfect , and i don' t want my imperfections to come to light , be taken advantage of , or hold me back from taking actions that aren' t me in the future . the only time i ' m willing to open up is when i ' m certain that a reveal won' t interfere with any changes i make in the future . but since i can' t be certain of my goals , that isn' t common . i can be a quiet generic person , or sometimes an outgoing generic person . since there' s usually no benefit in being outgoing , i ' m usually just quiet . i come off as a very normal guy , albeit with flat affect if trying to connect emotionally to someone isn' t my goal . js are sometimes seen as ambitious . i may be ambitious by nature( j ), but unwilling to settle for a certain goal( n ), ignoring of my true feelings( t ), and rather reclusive( i ) ."

enfj,"what are the ways u use to overcome stress.this is what i saw recently on a site abt types'' in national sample , highest in coping with stress by exercising . sorry if this thread is started before."
estj,"i made a mistake in my life . supposedly i never chatted online to this type gemini acquaintanceexclassmate of mine . he was an exclassmate . classmate in middle school that happened around yearwhen i wasyear old kid years old . then i went to junior high school(), didn' t have anything to do with the person for a while foryears ). then i went to senior high school , the person was in school again for anotheryears()and we never talked . we kind of do not know each otherview each other as a stranger . and i am fine with that . so life was okay for a while , i went to study in university . and then after university was over , suddenly this person messaged me on the msn asking me what i was doing , etc . talked to much over msn . i was actually kind of lazydid not want to talk to the person , because i had problem with my thenboyfriend so i did not feel like talking to anyone . so i just typed whatever i felt feeling like typing on the msn , i did not know even what i typed because i did not feel like talking to the person . so then , i fixed my problem with my thenboyfriend . i moved to stay with him in his country . i was studying . suddenly , this person sent me message on facebook asked me where i was , what i was doing , etc . the most correct step actually not to reply to his message . whenever he tried to talk to me over the msn , i should have never replied , because i have no desire whatsoever to talk to this person . so in short , i chatted a little bit too much on msn to a wrong person . this person was not a good person . he knew i was staying with my thenboyfriend and we were kind about to get married , but then this person was ruining everything . now my thenboyfriend divorced me( like i said , because his mother passed away ), and then now this type gemini person( which i despised )tried to talk telephatically to me , etc i believe he wanted to rape me . this person( type gemini )always looked for me , like trying to chat to me to msn , sending message and everything . i think he might , might want to( have sex )with me . maybe he wanted to have my kids , i do not know what is in his mind . i despised this person . i do not like him . i want this person to leave me alone . like leave me alone . go away . i made a mistake chatting with you . i should have never chatted with you . apparently talking to an type is not that easy because they are thinking they are the mastermind of the world and thus can make us all fitting to his plan . obviously this person thinks he was( or is )much more intelligent than me .( though as an type i do not think that is true ). anyhow i really do not like this type gemini . i want this person to leave me alone . go away . this person also does not abide by morality , ethics , and alot of things that should guide one' s action in one' s life , such as right and wrong things to do , etc . it wasted my time truth to be told to interact with this person . this person has crossed the line . he was only an exclassmate of mine . not even an acquaintance . but he has too far crossed the line and i want this person to go away and have nothing to do with me . i thought i would have nothing to do with this person anymore since yearor so . however , apparently being an type he has plan in his mind and i believe his plan is to make me pregnant , but by destroying everything that i have and i do not like this person at all . so i hate this person but this person may want to make me pregnant but i hate this person . i do not like this person at all . i want him to go away from my life . go away . leave me alone . i do not know why it seems like i still do not make myself clear . apparently an type thinking that they are much more superior than me in their mind so they can do whatever they want even if it disturbed me so much and unappreciated( i do not appreciate their conductbehavior ). and plus , ever since i talked to this person over msn i started dreaming when i sleep . i never dreamt at all when i slept , when i was in college or before i talked to this person over msn . i believe this type gemini can communicate to people through dream i do not know how he did that , but this type gemini i believe is a psychic he can do supernatural , paranormal , etc( i believe psychic is related to nidom )so i am not surprised if he can cause me to dream as well , but this has crossed the line . please mind your behavior , do not cross the line that should not be crossed . i am very angry with whatever he has done . no ethics , no morality . has crossed the boundaries of rights and wrongs . what he( this type gemini )did was wrong and i do not like that . he was only an exclassmate of mine and i do not want our connection to be more than that . if you have any advices on how to get rid of this person( type gemini male , tiger zodiac )would be greatly appreciated . because his presence is nothing but a nuisance to me . i want to have nothing to do with this person whatsoever . i want this person to get out of my life."

estj,"so , a certain type in my life has a habit of getting tired , denying it( i think they are anyway ), and verbally attacking me . when i ask them why they' re doing this they say i ' m annoying . if i walk through the room , i ' m annoying . if i say anything i ' m annoying . they say the harshest things and i can' t figure out why . i know they need their space but still , is there any way to get them to realize they aren' t being fair ? thanks ! "
istj,"hello types first time posting something in this part of the forum . this is also actually a positive post , so bare with me !so my partner and one of my best mates are both types . one major observation i' ve had of both of them is how amazing they are in an argument when they are fighting for something they either believe in , or if its for a common good . most recent example is my partner recently started volunteering to help run a local community centre . one of his major skills is bringing a business head to the table . without boring you with all the details of what' s been happening , he has had no fear in taking on both the local council( who have been a mixture of both hopeless and trouble makers )and problem volunteers in an argument( if it escalates that far )and then not standing down until they are put in their place . and it' s really is working !my best mate is very similar in an argument . confrontation basically doesn' t worry them and it' s something i massively admire in them both . i just wondered if this was the case for you guys in here too when you' re in a similar situation?"
esfj,"tell me about it . took the personalities with myyear old son this morning . i helped him with some of the terms that were more difficult . he came out as type , and just from looking at the function stacks , this makes a lot of sense to me . as an type , i ' m always trying to figure out people , and i definitely want to figure out my child . if i do so , i will then know how to interact , encourage , and discipline him in a way that he' ll be more receptive to . so tell me about your childhood in regards to the context of your type . were their traits you had growing up that , looking back , make you go oh gosh , yeah . definitely was type !?"
intp,"hey guys . first , thanks for reading my post . i am an type female in a relationship with a definite type .( somehow i hear you guys sighing already . p ). to keep the story short , i asked him a while back whether he was serious about our relationship , to which he appeared almost offended and said yes , i am serious . if i wasn' t serious why would i have done thisthat. . i understand that type men need their space , and i am sure that you know types like to feel attended to . but because i really like this guy , i choose to compromise . i text him abouttimes everydays . he responds relatively promptly but usually does not say much . he does not like to initiates texts , and can go quite a while without saying anything . he has many daily commitments , mostly professional , and has a very busy life schedule . we' re in different cities now , temporary . i have told him that i understand he is busy , but i would appreciate it if he could give me a call when he is free . he agreed and called me twice in the following week . after that , i waited almost a month and he did not call . eventually , i text him and ask politely if he could give me a call if he was not busy . he responded , did not seem annoyed , and called me that very evening . i guess what i ' m asking is is this normal for an type guy ? is he really serious about us as he says he is ? thank you so much ! "
enfj,"hello fellow types i' ve been taking a closer look at my innerself and i ' m realizing that a ton of my issues stem from low selfesteem . if i think about it there is no reason for me to not be confident in myself but its my natural tendency . example if a friend makes a skeptical face after i say something it affects me way more than it should . i ' m wondering if it is common for types to suffer from low selfesteem , how other types have dealt with it , and if it has gotten better with age . another quirk about me i don' t form extremely close relationships often . over the course of my life i have had one best friend .( best friend meaning someone i show my whole self to , someone i am completely comfortable with. )i think this might relate to me not being confident enough in myself to let people in . this is not to say i don' t have any friends . i have tons of friends , and really good ones that trust me a lot i just don' t give my whole self to them . my second question is this normal for types ? thanks !any comments about this or other type quirks are welcome !

estp,"i have high se , but i am curious how an type interacts with the world , what their thoughts are , inner world , struggles , strengths , just overall thoughts of life . i suck at concise wording.basicaallyyy.what is the high se type world like?"
enfp,"i reject the mother concept . what i mean by that is , i don' t call white people white , or black people black . i call them people . if someone abuses me because of my skin tone , i call them an abusive person , not a racist . when asked for my race on a form and i have to fill that part in , i tick other and write human in the little box . i basically reject the idea that white or black is a race to begin with . i ' m curious if anyone else here thinks this way , because the only two types i know irl both came to the same conclusion on their own."

esfj,"nami mbti typeone piece mbti nami typeone piece myersbriggs types thought you guys would like this post here too . so this is a post long overdue . my opinion is nami is an type and an fe dom . nami is not a te dom or type in my opinion . i personally don' t get where people see this in here , just because she' s bossy like i said in the past doesn' t mean she' s a te dom , people forget fe doms are just as bossy and assertive too , while also focusing on respect and other peoples emotions . nami is emotional , cries all the time like a feeler and not how a emotional thinker does , and is always thinking about other people' s emotional state and talking out loud about other peoples emotions . she reads peoples emotions very well , cares about manners , respect , and meeting people' s emotional needs . all fe in nami , and now i ' m gonna tell you why nami is type more in depth , share your opinion down below if you agree or disagree after reading . now where to begin . nami like i mentioned before is an fe dom and type and i will explain why now . whenever there is conflict among the crew , similar to sanji , nami is always focusing on the emotional state and feelings of the people in conflict or the person . i ' m not gonna stereotype here , or put gender roles , or gender stereotypes here . i hate stereotypes myself and are completely against them and always will be . but in this case i think they to a certain extent apply , sanji is always picking up on someones emotional state and is always thinking of another person' s emotions with his fe , but when he does this when conflict happens amoung the crew he tries to break it up which makes more sense as an type male which i type him in my opinion , an example of this is when he stopped chopper in waterand said you need to understand how usopp is feeling here chopper , if you pity him he' s going to feel even worse from the pity after losing the duel he asked for himself . but nami is an type woman and is always picking up on the emotional state of people especially conflict and feels distress , and she' s always trying to fix it right then and edge it on to fix the problem or have another character understand how the other character is feeling and apologize or to stop the conflict . she does this when luffy and vivi have their fight and argument . when luffy explains vivi wanting no one to die in a rebellion and clash with the royal army and then calls her to kindhearted . nami reacts and says wait luffy show some sympathy for vivi and understand how she' s feeling here and she gets emotional and then sanji stops her after ironically doing the same thing earlier saying a ton of people are going to die and that this is for vivi and focusing on her emotional state and stress with the situation . nami also comforted vivi later in the scene and hugged her . nami does these things time and time again in the series , these emotional outburst and failing to be logical in the situation and even saying things that are completely illogical a lot of the time and that don' t even make sense when she' s getting so emotional on what' s happening around her , showing clear inferior ti in her . when chopper gets taken away by foxy in the davy back fight and zoro scolds him for crying and says they did their best to win and to be tough and accept the loss , nami yells at zoro and literally says how can you say that ? !don' t you know how he feels ? !this is clear fe in nami coming out in this scene . nami is completely focusing on chopper' s emotional state and feelings in this situation , there is no logic here or efficiency or focusing on the task and what logically happened , this is pure emotion from nami and focusing on choppers emotions and feelings from being stolen from the crew by foxy and how emotional chopper feels about it and having leave the crew by force of the davy back rules , massive fe in nami in this scene . here' s my recent sanji type post , if you disagree and want to see my reasoning on him nami is very emotionally distressed when usopp and luffy are arguing in water. sanji feels luffy' s intense emotions with his fe especially when luffy raises his voice and almost tell him to leave , sanji feel the stress from luffy and the room and kicks him and feels so emotional about the stress that he' s panting in the scene and has a distressed look on his face . and he predicts what he was gonna say in the moment with his ni and se . nami while telling them to stop over and over again , starts trying to edge it on and fix the conflict right away when usopp leaves , she yells luffy and everyone telling them aren' t you going to stop him , we came all this way and usopp is our precious friend she says , then she says luffy stop him your the captain right ? and immediately starts crying and tearing up , and then seconds later says why aren' t you saying anything ? she then runs outs and yells at usopp to comeback followed by sanji and chopper who are also feelers in the group , and then luffy finally comes out and looks at him with his serious stare , zoro is the only calm logical one in this situation , and ironically we start seeing luffy getting emotional and losing his tough serious captain act when usopp starts talking . i' ve seen fe doms do this all the time and want the conflict resolved as soon as possible especially from the emotional stress their feeling and seeing everyone else emotionally in the room stressed out and in a negative state , this is all fe coming out in nami over logic which she doesn' t use or act like at all in this scene . her fe goes even further and further proves this point when nami literally walks into luffy' s cabin and room and starts yelling at him to fix the situation now and bring him back , she completely edges and pushes this on and is completely emotional in this scene and wants them to make up right away and is further she gets very emotional when their' s conflict and responds to other peoples emotions easily , especially in negative situations . and when she does this and has these emotional outbursts with what' s happening with people around her , she' s completely illogical and can' t calm down and see logical inconsistencies , see reason and logical assess things , or be objective and unemotional at all , further proving she has low inferior ti and high fe dom behavior . i forgot to mention also before when usopp declared the duel against luffy , nami was confused and emotionally distressed again and said what ? hey.what are you saying ? but yeah , again when nami is screaming at luffy trying to tell him to stop fighting , she asks why do you have to duel with your friend ? !if you give it time , you two will down , right ? !she says usopp just got upset because things were going to fast for him with the news . luffy then says now that we' ve come this far , we can' t go back . she fails too see this logically again with her inferior ti and pointlessly tries to edge it on and fix the problem . and then nami says that' s not true !you can apologize to him and talk it over again !showing fe conflict resolution and focusing on how two people feel emotionally in a situation and talking it over and fixing and resolving the conflict , major fe in nami here . when luffy explains and she leaves , she later gets pissed when she sees zoro and sanji fighting where we see more fe in sanji getting mad at zoro not beating the franky family and saying if you had usopp wouldn' t have been attacked and felt guilty with sanji focusing on usopp' s emotional state again , she yells at them and then tells them to stop , we don' t need anymore fighting !showing her fe and si clearly here . during the actual fight she was crying and couldn' t hold back her tears the entire time , she emotionally couldn' t take the situation at all or stand to see her crewmates fighting like that and broke down emotional from watching them and seeing everything that happened . nami was completely emotionally stressed when they went to save sanji and found him and luffy and sanji fought right in front of her . she again couldn' t emotionally handle seeing them fight , again like with luffy vs usopp , was reacting constantly and emotionally as the fight happened . the pain of watching them affected her so much emotionally that she says something completely illogical and says alright sanji we' ll leave !just please stop !this is clear fe dom and inferior ti in nami again . she was so emotional again in this scene that she walked up and slapped him and said goodbye with tears in her eyes and then says , sorry , we should have never done this , showing also she' s still considered his emotions to apologize , even after seeing the awful things sanji did to luffy and being completely mad at sanji here . all of this was massive fe for nami in this scene during the luffy vs sanji fight . and then nami' s fe comes out again with her motherly fe moment with the children . she turns around and says i can' t leave these kids behind and you can' t turn your back on children crying for help , after hearing what the kids say and reacting to the children' s emotions in the situation and telling her to comeback and help them get to their families again , fe moment again for nami . nami and tashigi have a fe and si talk about taking care of the kids and being driven by duty and taking responsibility for them to get them to their families . no matter what . this is a very fitting discussion since i type tashigi type , so there fe and si match up very well here when tashigi asks to take them instead , but with their functions in different orders ironically . nami and tashigi both have a major fe and si connection in this moment and its very apparent when you watch the scene . i could go further but i think these reasons are good enough . her si and ne are pretty clear . she' s very detail oriented and driven by security and not tasking risks and duty . she compares and contrasts details with the weather as a navigator and remembers details in her mind very well and recalls past details and events a lot , and those details from the past she remembers affect her decision making . certain past events affected how she is strongly today like an si user , like with the bellemere arlong thing and collecting the money in her village shaping her greed and obsession with money and jewelry , also i forgot to mention with nami' s fe dom she can manipulate others and getting what she wants by swaying their emotions with her body or other deceitful tactics she tries and sweet talking them and people into get what she wants which fe is known for when its not used for good . she also has a deep nostalgia to tangerines again with bellemere . even though she is more of a si user her ne is pretty clear to , at times she is curious about things and always asking questions and wondering why people said something or what' s up with something she notices in the world around her . she can be creative in battle to with her imagination and coming up with good idea with the climatact usopp made her and adapting to it quickly and its improvements in the series . i already mentioned her ti inferior and how illogical she gets in the series , but when she' s not showing her ti weakness , nami is good at deducing things and noticing logical inconsistencies here and there in situations and she' s very intelligent and sees loopholes easily at times . but she can' t do this enough or that often and completely misses logical in favor of emotion so many times that she' s a clear ti inferior in my opinion from observing her character throughout the series . so that' s why i think nami is a clear type , tell me what you think down below on the topic . nami is one piece at least one of the characters that defines the series , you can' t have the series without her , she' s an og character and straw hat , and her backstory is one of the saddest . so i wanted to clear up some misconceptions on her and type her accurately at least in my opinion , nami is not a fi user , she' s a fe user and i think i did good explanation on why i think so with evidence from the series on each point , i' d like to hear everyone' s opinions on this . also i really agree with this post on here being type as well , i don' t agree with all of their typings for the straw hats but i really agree with nami' s post on here that they did . the only straw hats typings i agree with that this site did that i personally agree on , are luffy , nami , and zoro . the rest of the straw hats that they typed , i personally disagree with in my opinion but you can decide for yourself your thoughts , thanks for reading . practical typing is bad at typing and misunderstands characters and functions a lot so don' t take them seriously ever , sasuke was typed type by them for example . but this post i agree with at least , even if i only agree with some of the straw hats here one piece nami( type )also here' s an excellent video on nami and a great character analysis for her"
intp,"question for types . well looking for clarity . my type just informed me , though he felt bad for disappointing me( cancelled dinner ), his life is too busy right now he needs to stop dating until things settle down . i told him i?m not sure what the challenge is .( work , family , something else )because he hasn?t shared that with me . told him i really enjoyed connecting with him and hope the feeling is mutual . i wished him all the best . he responded that the feeling is mutual and needs time to see how things go . and hopes to see me again someday . i have read that types make final decisions . does this sound final ? also , i have read that loyalty is important to types so i?m trying not to wonder if he really lost interest in me and didn?t have the heart to be blunt or that he met someone else . wish i could have concrete answers , they calm me , even if the answer is not a happy one . i want to keep the door open to him while giving him space( and i will respect his space ). what advice do you , as an type , have ? thank you , trying not to be so ?feeling ? focused."

intp,"if i were an extrovert it would be hard to understand how an introvert can view an object subjectively . unless i experienced it , which i have . but if i hadn' t it would be hard to understand the oxymoron of determing an object subjectively rather than focusing on the object as extroverts do . it would be just as hard to understand how that subjective viewpoint could be equally accurate to the objective viewpoint . and this is where a lot of introverts fail to see their worldview as equally accurate as the more extroverted sensors . carl jung says it is just as valid . seeing an object subjectively is a link to the primordial images. . the abstract truths of the universe that exists just as real as the material objects . but he also said that the collective unconscious is not able to be conscious . making examples elusive . i was happy to see this quote from him saying the introvert' s thoughts come directly from the unconscious , and are the same thing . the introverted attitude develops from a hereditary psychic structure , anterior to ego development , which includes consciousness and unconsciousness . the psychic structure of the introvert is described as identical to the collective unconscious , and it functions when conscious ideas are not present or are inhibited . it is the source of the introvert' s subjective views."

enfp,"i( an type )had this fight with my type best friend . to put it shortly , he really hurt me to the point i completely closed off , which led me to ghosting him when he tried to apologize and fix things . when i finally calmed down i apologized to him as well , and supposedly , we?re fine again . but somehow , things aren?t back to normal . he barely replies to my texts and when i finally got the chance to talk normally with him on a call he casually mentioned how he was doing great in life and proceeded to talk about his experiences with his other friends during the time we weren?t talking . that really made me feel like he?d be better without me . we were so close before , we?d hang out multiple times a week despite already seeing each other in school , talk in calls every night. . is it normal for types to find other new people like that ? and is there even anything i can do about it ? i really really miss him but i get the feeling that he doesn?t care at all about me now"

isfp,"i am certain without a doubt i am an xsfp personality type but i am not sure if i am type or type . i will describe myself and hobbies etc and maybe it can help create a more accurate picture of which type i lean more towards . i understand they both use the same functions , just slightly different orders . i am very passionate about music . i am a songwriter and record music myself and it is by far my favorite way i express myself to the world . songs can move me deep inside instantly and i can listen to a song on repeat over and over . i know whether i like something right away . i connect to the overall feel . i tend to like moody indie folkpop type music but my taste is very eclectic . i love nature and anything being surrounded in dramatic landscapes . the forest , coastline , mountains , and open countryside bring me so much peace and happiness . it?s like i am totally rejuvenated after being in those environments . i am highly affected by lighting and sensitive to changes in the immediate environment . i am captivated by sunsets . i love going for drives or riding my motorcycle . something about it just grounds me and helps me feel relaxed and at ease in the world . it also allows me to see new sights and take time to reflect which i love !i do enjoy people but i spend a significant time alone , not always by choice but by the nature of my lifestyle and job etc . i am very independent by nature , and do most things alone . something i have always enjoyed doing is people watching . i love to analyze what is happening around me . i am very passionate with my beliefs and values . if i see someone either violating those , or not respecting mine , it is an instant turn off for me and i do not have any desire to create connection with that person any longer . i am a huge advocate for treating others with kindness and compassion , and listening to others and validating their opinions and beliefs regardless if ours don?t align . that being said , i can be very outgoing and life of the party in some situations especially with close friends or family , but also very quiet and reflective too depending on the mood i am in . when there is too much stimuli around me , i can get rather frazzled and overloaded . i am sensitive to energy around me . this is me in a nutshell !let me know what you think !

estp,"hi types !female type here looking for some insight on a guy . i started a new job in june of this year in a training group with aboutothers . from the beginning , i felt a mutual attraction between myself and an type . we started talking nearly every work day , just chatting and laughing together , nothing serious at all . after about a month , i realized i was crushing on him , and i sensed he felt the same way . a couple months later , and i overheard him mention his girlfriend to a coworker of ours . this was completely new news to me , and after he mentioned her to the coworker , he glanced over at me. . i think to gauge my reaction . he eventually started bringing her up in passing to me , but very rarely . so , don' t judge me , but. . fast forward to now , and everything has been building up for months . we' re both obsessed with each other and talk constantly while at work . we normally are very comfortable , but randomly have moments where you could cut our tension with a knife . he opens up to me , always tries to make me laugh , is very attentive , and we are just like a sounding board and support system for each other . his work best friend has grilled me about my dating life , what i ' m interested in , etc .( his work best friend is gay btw , so he obviously wasn' t asking for himself ). the type is more of a guy' s guy . and i' ve noticed i ' m the only girl he acts this way towards . my work friend told me he once described me as so fucking cool and funny when someone brought me up . i do want to add that , though we' re constantly talking , he seems to try to not cross any lines . he doesn' t compliment me , talk about wanting to be with me , ask me about my dating life , rag on his girlfriend in front of me , etc . so i think it' s why things have progressed without feeling too risky . but he' s so darn playful , will point at me from across the room while surrounded by people , has nicknames for me , teases me , respects my opinion , tries to impress me , is always eager to help me with my work . sigh anyway. . i' ve never sensed he' s happy with his girlfriend . they live together and have been a couple aboutyears . i' ve overheard him complaining about her to his work best friend . every time he' s mentioned her to me , it' s in passing and in a matteroffact way . he and i just recently became facebook friends , and he has no relationship info and no pictures with her . they' re currently on aweek trip in europe that he paid for and they' ve been planning for about a year , so there' s a tiny part of me that thinks maybe he' s considering breaking up with her after . of course he keeps posting pictures from the trip , but none with her in it. . types , in your reliably honest opinionwhat are some possibilities here ? tia."

esfp,"dear fellow type' s , as we all know , we gain energy from interaction . most actions performed on our own drain energy since there is no one to share the experience with . i' ve read many articles about the different types and also the balance between e and i . people say that there is no such thing as ae or i , the only problem with a statement like this is that i ' m the living proof of the contrary . we all have hobbies and passions . for the many years i' ve been on this planet i' ve never been able to find something that truly energizes me on my own . i always feel the need to be around people and when i am it' s like i gain an energy shot . i love music , i dj from time to time and i' ve been working in the music scene for many years now . but the moment i try to spin some records by myself it' s as if all this passion that i do have when i ' m around people completely vanishes . it makes me feel extremely insecure about what is real . so my question is how can someone who isextravert find comfort and energy in an introvert action . cause one way or the other , you only gain skill by practicing , on your own . i truly hope to find some answers to my problem and i' d love to meet some people who are coping with the same issues."

istp,"hi all , writing to this forum for some help . i am an type with huge crush on a type . it?s the craziest crush ever happened in my life . we met at work more than two years ago , at the beginning he was acting as if he was another person very kind , always perfect , always replying to my text , i even thought he was an ?fj ? type which caused me to send him romantic texts and talking about my feelingsand you can imagine. . then his real type nature started slowly to come up when i started asking him for a date . and from there we exchanged many messages , but we never met in person outside the office . is like one day we fight , then i stop chatting him , he comes back with a silly joke but everytime in the past i asked to meet for a beer or a coffee he said no . in the last couple of months , everytime i asked him to call just to chat he always made himself available and we always laugh so much( even though sometimes for me is very hard to find a topic to discuss , i am not in to any of his sports even though i am very sporty and he does not share anything about his private lifeso i never ask ). we had a very sweet call( at least from my side )for christmas and then he said ?we talk again after the vacation break ? but when i texted him in jan , he seemed to be coldbtw i hate texting him , as i don?t get his tone of voice so sometimes when he replies with justword i have doubts if he is joking or if he does not want to chat to me . for sure , i am aware he has his private life and all the fun with other girls , but i am very puzzled . am i just a colleague ? am i just someone nice to have around ? i made my interest in him very clear by saying i really like knowing someone special like him as i can learn a lot from him . any point of view much appreciated ! "
istp,"i know that type and type are supposed to never work , but my previous relationship with an type felt very natural . i like the way he handled me straight forward no bs . i love how he took control in the bedroom , like he wasn' t thinking all the time , he just let himself go . another awesome thing about him , and i ' m presuming other type' s will relate he didn' t feel the need to impress people all the time . something that really turns me off about a guy is when i can feel him being fake around people , my type never did that , he was just so bloody real . we broke up after a really good weekend actually , he told me he just didn' t feel anything any more . i am now aware that type' s emotions can change very quickly . i think he was still in love with his ex though he got back with her shortly after we broke up . he is now single again and talking to me . he asked me to go to the movies , but then he cancelled the night before ? he called me pretty at a party and kissed me , and then didn' t look at me for the rest of the night . we were hanging with the same group of friends for the day and he was obviously trying to go out of his way to impress me or make me laugh( i can read him well sometimes )but then i caught him looking at me and i gave him a smile so he left the room and didn' t acknowledge we again for ages . what the heck is going on in this guys head ? can any other type' s put some light on this ? is there any point in me having feelings for him , or should i just leave it in the past?"
entj,"so , i realize this comparison has been brought up many times over the years , but i just wanted to type this out and see if anyone had some insight? your help is much appreciated !background i?m fairly certain my father is type , but i often find myself wondering if really he?s an estx , and i?m just blinded by intuitive bias . i?m an type , my sisters are type and type , and my mom was also type( with highly developed ni ). so , theoretically , he and i are the lone intuitives in our family . as for him in terms of profession , he is both an artisan and an entrepreneur? but his actual passion is being one of the figureheads of the antique motorcycle world . by day , he is a leathersmithhis own store( he prides himself on working alone ), which has been in business for overyears( he?s)? but by ?night ? he?s hosting national motorcycle swap meets( where he employs hundreds of vendors , security , has property contracts etc )as well as riding his antique bikes in prestigious , cross country races( he?s won at least two of them ). oh , and he definitely holds court wherever he goes . basics? an extrovert . very domineering , very to the point , probes how people think and sizes them up immediately( and almost always verbally expresses his first impression of them , too )definitely displays a certain showmanship? views life as a pissing contest , more or less he is very politically involved and even engaged( has written scathing editorials about the mayor took me to city hall meetings as a kid , where he spoke against expanding our mall at the cost of local businesses )? but does not vote( says bc he works alone he can?t afford jury duty ? ? )constantly says ?are you in or out ? and other blackwhite phrases is definitely considered ?quirky? ? as well as frank( fittingly , his name )very good with numbers , often asking those around him for percentages from somewhat obscure fractions( ie ?what?sdivided by?? , expecting an immediate response? when he already knows the answer . he owns multiple properties , and has been sitting onacres of land that will undoubtedly be king leared away between my sisters and me when he dies( i suspect that it?s his intention ). over the years , he?s wanted to utilize that land( at one point he was thinking windmills )? but no one has pitched him a good enough proposal . work habits when making garments , he references mathematical principals and theories( ie law of the pendulum )only dresses to impress when he is actually involved with the event , otherwise prefers a tshirt and jeans? would rather look rugged than groomed( but when groomed the aesthetic is a pinstripe suit with a proper windsor knot )enjoys being considered ?blue collar? ? even though he?s worth more than six figures . is very ron swansonesque with money( ie cheap , and hides it in obscure places as opposed to keeping it in banks )prefers to live and work in chaos . knows where everything is , but to the untrained eye his house and workspace look very much like hoarders? he expects others to pick up after him has a wide circle of friends , almost all of whom are his audiencefollowers and enjoy listening to him talk his necessities( aka his motorcycles )will always come first , even before his family keeps a pretty set schedule , esp when training at the gym for his races? his store opens and closes at the same time , he eats breakfast at the same time etc as a parent when i gave him ?the art of war ? he was already very familiar with at least half of the battles outlined( as well as the terminology )always pays the bill , seldom shows up to the event( ie my mom?s funeral )emphasizes having ?plan a , plan b and plan c ? ad nauseam also emphasizes ?doing the right thing? ? ?making sacrifices ? and ?learn from my mistakes ? fiery temper when disagreed with , often explosive? always condescending shuts down resistance rather than hearing it out seldom( if ever )apologizes has never shown interest in any of my interests , but is a verified scholar of motorcycle history and lights up if you ask about it left me homeless for a month my sophomore year of college bc he thought i should have ?slept in the boiler room like rudy? ? never physically disciplined me , no matter how angry he?s gotten two last anecdotes my father?s prized possession is a s art deco motorcycle( pictured below )he not only fully restored , but took further than the original creator , in terms of vision . he also made the leather seat by hand . when my grandmother moved into a nursing home and he began to visit , he started bonding with the terminal men in residence there . before long , he started sneaking them beer , junk food? and eventually began sneaking them out of the nursing home and into the local strip clubs? he says it makes them feel ?alive ? one last time( the nurses , of course , eventually put a stop to it !)lastly , i?m pretty sure he?s an w when it comes to enneagram? and he?s a scorpio , if that makes a difference . sorry if this was too longindulgent? but i figured the more info the better !

esfj,"something i don' t quite understand about types is that they derive their happiness from the approval of others . for example , i know an type who religiously tracks the number of likes they get on facebook and instagram . it seems that types are very kind and generous to others , but that stems from a desire to be wellliked , not necessarily from philosophically valuing kindness and generosity . to me( an inxj ), this sounds like a very insecure approach to life . how do more mature types work around this ? is there a better word than insecurity to describe this ? can somebody clarify this for me or elaborate on this ? thank you !

intj,"at this point the type stereotypes are well worn ruts in the road of intellectual discussion of our type . i ' m personally bored to death with the everrevolving door of threads asking how much we personify this that or the other stereotype( see thethreads asking to what extent we' re sociopaths , autistic , geniuses , capable of love , able to care about others , arrogant , assholes , etc ). i ' m in the mood to turn things on their head , so let' s talk about the ways we don' t fit or defy or are the polar opposite of any of these popular stereotypes . share your uniqueness , and feel free to go as in depth about it as you want or just state it . more in depth discussion might include do you think the stereotype you defy is invalid , do you think the stereotype is valid as far as generalizations go but think you have a particular developmental path that led you to be different , do you think the stereotype is valid but only tells part of the story and you occupy the other part , do you think your apparent opposition to the stereotype is really only a surface level understanding and you can explain how the apparent contradiction actually fits perfectly into the stereotype , etc."

entp,"do type' s need to be in a relationship ? type' s can be independent , not really much into commitment and being in different relationships throughout their lives . however , i haven' t ever met an type who is not in a relationship or isn' t pursuing one . if they have the looks , skills and intelligence , it seems they end up with a partner . i think i' ve once quoted words from an type that impacted me the agenda of an type is to be loved . is this the case for all of us ? it seems to be for me at this stage of my life()but i ' m not certain of it being permanent . do we have an empty void inside that only a good companion will fill( even if it' s just temporary )? if not , what can satisfy it and take it away ? does it have to be a person ? i personally do feel such void . it' s there , but i don' t know if it' s necessary to have a human help it . my friends , though great , haven' t been enough( this may be my fault ? ), so this is why i ' m curious about this . what' s your take on it , guys ? are you married because you needed to be , or are you rocking life on your own ? do you need to be especially loved ? do you feel the void ? what has helped it ? is a relationship the only way ? thanks in advanced for any responses."

estj,"hi typestypesanyone that can share , i' ve seen quite a lot of threads that question a possibility of having a positive relationship between types and types . on the paper it seems like an interesting combo all unctions the same , but in a reversed order . also , the same judgeing functions , but types leads with fi when types leads with te . not to mention that this combo was originally described as one of the' ideal matches 'by keirsey. . all that would suggest there actually is a possibility for those two to work things through , understand one another and form a friendship( i take is as a base for any other healthy relationship ). so types have you everbeen friends with types ? types have you everbeen friends with types ? if so. . what was this combo like for you . what are your experiences ? what worked , what could have been better ? what did you enjoy doing together ? what did this relationship brought to you ?( possibilities to grow )? i am experiencing some troubles in trying to understand some types i' ve encountered in my life. . i don' t want to get to negative about it , so i guess i am kind of searching for some inspiration here how to turn things around . .thank you happy"

enfj,"and i quote this longing for the perfect carries over into the careers of type' s , who experience some degree of restlessness whatever their jobs . and , as with type' s , type' s have a wide range of occupations which offer success . being verbally adept , type' s contribute to an unusual level dealing with people , particularly face to face the media , the ministry , and stage and screen are populated successful type' s . they make superior therapists , charismatic teachers , excellent executives , personalized salespersons . areas that would not permit utilization of the intereactional talents of the type' s , for example , accounting , should be avoided , otherwise , almost any people to people occupation where personal , sustained contact is involved capitalizes on the personality of the type . i ' m currently an accounting major and i love my major but i' ve been having a weird' gut 'feeling about it . accountants are typically very technical , to themselves and not really into interacting with people . of course , in this day and age things are changing and accountants need great managing skills to succeed way beyond the norm . i' ve met lots of accountants , auditors , tax accountants who are not like your typical' stay in the background and crunch numbers types '. even though the field is changing , i still feel like i ' m missing something in my major . i absolutely love people . i want to help people and make a difference in this world . the thought of being stuck behind a cubicle preparing tax statements for a corporation or in a room with an audit team checking through invoices made me go nuts  ! i' ve been searching through these personality tests and careers to see how can i still follow my dream of using my talents in accounting to help people and finally concluded that i should look into becoming a financial advisor or director of some sort of financial literacy program . i want to help people plan and figure out how they can save money , manage their finances and maybe even do their taxes here and there . i wouldn' t mind being a cpa where i can work on statements and taxes but i also want to advise . i even found some jobs with the department of treasury that were centered around spreading financial literacy and i was likeding ding ding  ! score  ! my accounting college focuses more on preparing students to work for large accounting firms so i had to dig deep for this kind of information . if there is another type out there who' s interested in a field that doesn' t typically fit with their personality typecontinue to do research . there is a career path out there for you . you can mixandmatch your talents with your career goals and make it work for you . it might involve you completely changing your major or it might involve you taking a path that' s different from your colleagues( like me !). most of my friends are going into public accountingwhich is great. . but not really what i want to do . another notei am heavily involved in my church . i love ministry . i love performing and acting and music . i am a singer , guitarist , clarinet player and actress . you can imagine how aggravated i was when i had to slow down on my involvement in my choir when my accounting classes became to difficult to handle lol . i also love leading people . most accountants prefer being behind the scenes . people like me who become accountants move on past their staff accountant levels to pick up roles as controllers of companies etc etc . i don' t mind working in the corporate world too much , but i would prefer to use my talents with a ministry or nonprofit organization . it could even be a forprofit company as long as they have a mission of some sort to help individuals . heck , i wouldn' t even mind starting up my own thing !i have an entrepreneurial spirit too . it' s a long post. . but i hope it' s of use to someone out there. . just wanted to share !roud"

entj,what are some common traits you find in immatureyounger types?
infj,"greetings and salutations to fellow types . this is basically a thread , that is a cry for help . i was wondering about what your teenage years were like , specifically? you see , the source of this curiosity really stems from my own internal map of stresses . so i ' m going to share with you my experience , to see if any of you may relate , and if so , you can choose if you would like to offer me insight . if you don' t relate with what i say , i' d still like to hear about your teenage experience . note that i did not say high school experience , i ' m asking specifically about the teenage experience in it' s psychological entirety . anyways , here is my problem . i ' myears old , female . that alone provides me plenty of troubles in this society . i live in southern california , in a small town where the only person on our most wanted list is someone who stole a dyson vacuum from walmart , or target . i forgot which . i was expelled a month and a half into my first year of high school , which was actually a little over two years ago now ,( i ' m a sophomore now , th grade )so i didn' t get and never will have the regular' high school experience 'most people have . i was put into an expulsion program with other kids who were expelled , but even there , i never belonged . i wasn' t a burnout . i was just desperate for change . anyways , it wasn' t until the beginning of this semester that i was transferred into independent study . now i only go to school once a week , for a single hour . before that , i' ve maintained a strong guard against the world and myself . of course , my feelings manifested through my behavior even if i didn' t not feel my feelings first hand , since i have a tendency to repress or shut my feelings off . these behaviors were either self destructive , sadistic , thrill seeking or ultimately abstaining and intellectual . now i ' m getting to the point. . what i thought would be a wonderful opportunity as a break from my negative behaviors and a doorway to engaging more of my time in intellectual behaviors. . has actually become a tormenting limbo , a complete nightmare that eats at the back of my head in my waking consciousness and even in my dreams . my room isn' t finished being painted , i have anxiety about living with my parents , i never leave the house , i have no friends. . and i have no outlet . i ' m doomed to repeat the same thing every day . sleep , wake up , read the same pages on the computer , eat the same meals , watch the same movies or tv shows , stare at the same window , sleep on the same bed. . and repeat . i didn' t realize that the only reason i had intellectual behavior was to maintain a sense of neutrality with my negative behaviors that manifested when facing the world . so now that all i ' m facing is myself , i have no way to even prepare , so i had no idea what i really got myself into . it' s maddening . i feel like i ' m going mad . you see , i was alienated . so , i isolated in response . now , i ' m alienated because i ' m isolated . it' s a vicious cycle of alienation and isolation . it' s torture . but at the same time , it' s worse to be alienated rather than isolated . at least when i ' m not leaving the house , i ' m not being figuratively punched in the face all the time with alienation . but being isolated. . it' s deliberate and therefore much more shameful because it' s like i ' m doing this to myself. . but now that i ' m stuck in the cycle i can' t get out . i have nowhere to turn because i ' m completely isolated . this is not a painful experience . just an excruciating one . it doesn' t hurt though , it' s just. . i mean , it' s like purgatory , really . that' s what it feels like . limbo , or purgatory , something like that ? the first circle of hell , right ? i mean , i think this is really just all from the fact that i am isolated so now that i don' t have anything left to face about the world. . all i have left to face is myself . and now that i ' m realizing all the darkness in myself , i don' t know where else to go . it' s like i was sucked into the dimension of darkness by some portal that i should have avoided eye contact with . it' s like i looked into the eyes of medusa and now i ' m paying the price , except , looking into the eyes of medusa was really looking into the eyes of my reflection . so now that i' ve sunken this low , and i ' m starting to realize that this is the darkest point i' ve ever endured in the entire course of myyears in this world , i don' t know what to do . i have nowhere else to go except further downwards . i think the only way i can climb back up is if i hit rock bottom , because if i just' snap out of it 'and ignite my old flame , or if i just' disconnect 'and be an empty shell , that would be even more pathetic because that just seems like denial or avoidance . i theorized the source of my problem to be my lack of confidence . i know , so typical . but it runs deep . i grew up being told i had no talent and no purpose . it was the running joke of my life , sure , i even laughed with my family about it . however , children are very impressionable . i look back on my life and realize the only source of esteem i had was my stoicism . my only source of self worth , was my silent pride in being able to shut the fuck up and take the pain . in middle school , it was the same , except that' s when i started extracting confidence from sadistic behaviors or selfdestructive behaviors . but deep down , i' ve always felt that i had a destiny . a destiny for something greater . the path , my path . but deep down , i' ve also always felt it was impossible , unrealistic . now i ' m at the point in my life , as a human being who has a fixation on looking towards the future. . where i really don' t know my destiny . and i feel it' s too late to develop some sort of skill or talent . i ' m lost , and i' ve fallen in a river , and now i ' m sinking and drowning and it would be a miracle if i had found a rope to grab onto . i just feel like there will never be that rope , because that rope would lead me to a destiny manifested through myself . there is nothing to manifest through myself except for darkness , or ultimate monotonous neutrality . i look at my life , and i don' t recall a time where i have ever been what other people like to call happy . the' best 'i' ve ever felt , was' content '. it' s all because i have no sense of purpose . only a sense of longing for one . this is the source of all my insecurities , stresses , shame , etc . my question is , am i just a hormonal teenager who is over exaggerating everything so i can feel like my life is more than it really is ? or am i just going through a variant teenage type experience ? so what was your experience like as a teenager ? can you relate ? how did you grow out of , or overcome any issues you had as teenagers ? does the history of your psychological evolution during your teenage years still affect you to this day ? are the teenage years the darkest years ? do you think that once i grow out of this , i can have the maturity to be able to maintain a better sense of self control , and therefore be able to have the strength and experience to not be even capable to fall back to where i am right now ? i don' t really know where i ' m going with all of this . i ' m kind of just rambling . i can' t even organize the way i write anymore. . it' s all just rambling."

estj,"i have two right now. my manager . she takes time to look into what i?m saying . she wants to help individuals and the company both ?which is the best way to go in my opinion . her intensions are great . she gives the benefit of the doubt , which i see as a huge part of her success in relationships as an type .. my patient who i just saw . he told me he wants true love in his relationship with his partner like he saw with me and my husband and i see he has this now . it is beautiful . he also is so positive ? always working to keep positive and i am so grateful for that . he sees what others do and appreciates everyone . what a good example to me and others !

enfp,"hello you fellow type' s !i ' m an type female in my thirties . my latest relationship was with an type who sadly was abusive . i ' m still seeing a therapist but am at a better place now . after him i decided that should i ever fall in love again , it would be with someone more like me . i recently met this great man , also in his thirties . we hit it off immediately . i don' t want to sound all cheesy , but he feels like a soulmate and i' ve never felt this type of connection . we have similar backgrounds , same hobbies , same future plans , we think the same and have so much in common . sounds perfect , huh ? well here' s the thing. . after we had known each other for a while , i brought up the mbti and he took the test . i was surprised to learn he' s an typea( i ' m an typet ). on the type spectrum we are somewhat opposites on how we score on all the areas , i ' m nearlyon the jp spectrum , where as he' s a very clear p . many sources suggest type' s being a great match , should they learn to communicate and handle conflicts effectively . some pages then again suggest that two type' s make for an explosive hot mess where no one seems to be in control , the house looking like a landfill , no one paying the bills or remembering the dentist appointments and the whole thing just being an exhausting whirlwind of adhd , chaos and emotions . the thing is , we' re both pretty mature and assertive . we are both very clean , like to have things put in their place and never miss those dentist appointments , lol . we have successful careers and our finances taken care of . my only issue is my tendency to overanalyze and stress stuff . he , being an a , doesn' t really overanalyze or stress too much . he' s willing to take the lead if needed . we both like to stick to our promises and are not super overbearing in social settings . we communicate well . i dislike conflict but , thanks to therapy , have learned to be more assertive . he doesn' t mind conflict but thinks it' s healthy to argue at times . he appreciates my openness and respects my boundaries . it' s usually me that tends to double check if i was too direct . luckily , he doesn' t get easily offended . i guess the question here is , can two wellrounded , mature type' s make for a good couple ? it would feel kind of ridiculous to not pursue this since i really like him a lot and he' s such a kind and beautiful soul . i feel like the sources painting a picture of type' s being all adhd and them learning absolutely nothing from each other are pretty dang harsh . would love to hear your experiences and thoughts on this !

esfj,"hello all , i don' t know how many types there are on this forum but any feedback from any types are welcome . i ' m a person who has always been emotionally needy . i seek out validation but am never satisfied with what i get and always want more . a lot of this is because i had emotionally abusiveneglectful parents . being able to be emotionally open with people is how i bond with them , feel comfortable around themclose to them , and learn to trust them . unfortunately , i am not very good at holding back when i do this and i tend to bulldoze others . i then become too overwhelming for others to handle , and end up driving the people i care about the most away because of it . i ' m trying to work on this and will be going back to therapy soon( i haven' t been in about a year ). i don' t have many friends despite feeling lonely very easily , and have social anxiety despite being an extrovert at heart . not having close friends to talk to because i don' t want to emotionally bulldoze them is sort of killing me . until i learn to hold back and not bulldoze , i ' m trying to keep it to myself but it' s so , so hard . are there other sfjs( or perhaps any fe valuing type )that can relate to this ? what have you done about itwhat are you doing about it ? if you' re not an sfjfe valuer andor you don' t relate to this but know people like this , do you have any tips or advice for how i can avoid the bulldozing ? signs that i ' m starting to bulldoze , how to know when to pull back , etc ? does anyone have advice on how to find the balance between getting the dose of validation all people need and finding emotional closeness with people through being open , and not completely steamrolling them or overwhelming them in the process ? currently i ' m in an all or nothing sort of place where i can' t be open with people or i know i ' m going to steamroll them , and until i can find this balance i don' t want to hurt others , but in the meantime i ' m in this limbo where i feel excessively lonely because i don' t feel like i have any support since i can' t be open anymore( for now ). obviously this is an issue that a therapist will solve much better than strangers on the internet can . but all tips and feedback are welcome( plus hey give me a break i ' m trying to find healthier ways to connect with people and stop feeling lonely while i ' m in the process of fixing this) "
infj,"hello people , it' s been a while since i have been online . recently i thought a lot about being type and the solitude that comes along with it . back then i tried to fight it with all my power and was a person i truly wasn' t meant to be . a couple of years ago aroundtocovid gave me the chance to delve into solitude and i absolutely loved it  ! i can write , i gain energy , i can contemplate , take walks and enjoy my time . i got off my phone and lived( i never was that much on my phone but i reduced it a lot ). during that time i found really deep friendships and people i can truly connect with and that is great !but recently i wondered about something and i see a lot of types talking and writing about it but nobody stated it the fomo about finding a relationship . for you out there who don' t know what the heck that means fomo is the fear of missing out on something . normally this fear is coupled with social media but it must not be that way . right now i am at the age ofand never was in a relationship . as i said i recently contemplated the solitude of being an type . especially in the summertime i happen to see a lot of couples . when i see them i can' t help but wonder how would it feel to be in a relationship ? as i grew older i hoped these thoughts will go quiet but actually the opposite of that happened. . i feel like missing out on something big. . usually i have no problem being alone but this state of constantly of worrying about missing out on something is pretty heavy. . do you know that feeling ? and how do you people( especially type )deal with that feeling ? i would love to hear your insights . have a good week !? "
entj,mytype friends does this a lot and i feel that it' s not typical for tedom to do this . he advises me emotionally( though still practical )and usually express his care rather openly( not telling me something and then tell me later and reasoned it as not to make me feel downwhich is true )oh and that they are very' physical ' .like hugging and things( one of them less so though ). is this just typical for type or these guys sort of let me into their circle?
istp,"i ' mand have been working for the same company foryearsthrough college and then for a couple years after . my degree is in journalism , but i have discovered i ' m too quiet and nonconfrontational to get far in that business( the only ones who get paid more than bare bones are willing to butt their noses into other peoples 'business and challenge them with tough questions.which is not something i ' m naturally comfortable doing. )i ' m in a salesoperations management position . the operations management part i love , especially when things start running ragged and i have to push myself to solve problems in the most efficient manner possible . the sales management partnot so much if i could manage the operation without having to manage the people( and especially motivate them to sell well ), i' d be in heaven . when i was actually a frontline sales representative , i was worn out every day not so much due to the constant interaction with others( i ' m not a super strong i )but more because i had to continually convince people my product was worth buying over their objections , and i don' t take rejection well . oh , and while i ' m good at the detailed paperwork requirements of the job( i fix everyone else' s mistakes because i ' m the only one who knows all of our policies backwards and forwards ), i hate it , maybe because the paperwork is an artificial creation of our oldfashioned owners who don' t believe in modern technology and thus seems pointless to me . but i am very good at the details and dotting all the is and crossing all the ts( as long as i can finish what i startednot always a natural trait of mine !). oh , my latest project the better part of the last year has been spent researching and putting together a new network and ip phone system for my company . that' s been the only thing keeping me going , and i' ve found that work fascinating . it' s also immensely satisfying to me to see it all up and running perfectly( at least within the limits of the nonexistent budget i have to maintain it all ). that project is pretty much complete( except for a couple of incremental additions ), and i ' m starting to get stressedbored again . suffice it to say , i need something new . i work for a franchise the easiest option is to push for a job with our corporate parent doing something similar but in the corporate structure that allows much more freedom of movement( upwards and sideways , as the corporate parent has branches in nearly every major city in the country ). but while i' ve been indoctrinated with a pretty good sales management process that i can share and add value with , it' s the most draining part of my current job , and i don' t look forward to doing that in a new job . my other motivation is that i ' m looking to leave state . right now , i ' m stuck in alaska , which i find a bit claustrophobic . odd , you might think , and alaska should be an type' s dreamtons of adrenalineheavy outdoorsy options up here and tons of the handson bluecollar jobs types should like . that brings me to my thread title . i love to hike the mountains of alaska( i think it' s the exploring new trails thing i rarely enjoy hiking somewhere i' ve already been ), but beyond that , i ' m not a huge fan of the outdoors . and i hate the cold , so highoctane winter sports( like snowmobiling , downhill skiing , etc. )don' t appeal to me . i ' m also not a fan of the handson jobs typically recommended to typesmechanic , construction worker , steelworker , etc . i' ve never been very handy with building things( at least shelves , doors , kitchens , etc.i' velt plenty of computers , though !). i ' m not really a bluecollar person and also not strong or athletic .( honestly , nothing against blue collar folksthey kind of intimidate me . i wish i were handy and could do that stuff. )and one of my main passions in life is travel , which is made far more difficult and expensive due to my location . i can' t just hop in a car and hit up a neighboring city or state , and airline tickets out of here aretimes as expensive on a permile basis than tickets in the lower. i have friends in l.a . and new york who jet off across the country for underround trip or visit europe for underi ' m lucky to get to seattle for under. a recent trip to orlando cost me( fortunately , i had a discount voucher i had to use that made it affordable ), and europe' s, at a minimum , often more . australia or asia are , . i really need to be near an airport with much better deals than that before i go bankrupt !the other option i always see recommended for types who want a more intellectually stimulating position is something in the maths or sciencesmost often engineering . the biggest problem with that while i don' t suck at it , i hate math and couldn' t imagine doing anything that involves it every day or having to go back to school and study especially higher math . i started out in school with a. and managed to end on a. , even with having had some trouble staying focused towards the end , so i trend towards the intellectual stuff morebut certainly not math . i ' m far more comfortable with words , though if i had it all to do over , i might pick something like geology.not sure why i find that interesting , but earth scienceespecially under the earthhas always fascinated me , as has astronomy , but that requires math , too. . ok , let me try to boil this down . what are my strengths ? writing technical stuff research and reading , especially if it' s interesting to me what are my interests ? travel(by fari flew, miles last year , all for leisure if i ' m not on a road trip or plane trip at least once a month , i go completely batty )technical stuff , especially networks i don' t feel as stupid saying this here as i might otherwise , but i like trains.something tells me that might not be foreign to types aviation( i actually have most of a private pilot license completed and really want to finish it )what motivates me ? appreciation helping people a job that pays roughly equivalent to my current salary( i.e . no entrylevelan hour jobs i need to be in theper hour range just to survive with my current debt load from school and travel needs ). i am not , however , truly motivated by money . now , taking the above into account , what options are there ? i' ll start with my resume and analyze those computer technician( worked for an independent contractor )pros leverage technical knowledge handson work with tangible results cons not motivatedorganized enough to manage my own business breaking into established business difficult without experience and certifications , and i can' t afford to start at the bottom with a hr tech support job )audio engineer( front of houselive sound )pros employ my modest musical ability people say they enjoy my mixes get to play with cool technical gadgetry cons hard to break into that field in more than a small way and make money at it to truly be employable , you have to be a bit more handy than i am( constructing flown line arrays , etc . oh , i hate heights )not sure it would be intellectually stimulating enough for more than a few years don' t want to end up like the bitter old grizzled sound guys i know tongue frontline sales pros decent money get to meet interesting people cons constant rejection issues have to make small talk with uninteresting people railroad brakeman pros decent money easy job get to play around big equipment all day cons not intellectually stimulating can get repetitive note i worked in freight i' ve considered looking into passenger operations , since i think that would hold more variety in dealing with the traveling public operationssales manager pros they hired me back after i was laid off from the railroad tongue operations challenges and business analysis interesting cons supervising and motivating employees very draining beginning to feel like i don' t have a purpose there except to push meaningless paper now , what careers have i looked at or have had recommended to me ? pilot pros good money( after a long time )prestige get to play with cool technical equipment travel the world( or at least a part of it )cons very expensive and make beans for the firstyears unstable job environment potentially not intellectually stimulating andor repetitive after awhile flight attendant pros interaction with public in a nonsales capacity travel the world( or at least a part of it )cons crap for pay not intellectually stimulating andor repetitive after awhile travel agent pros i love to help others arrange travel use of knowledge of travel industry cons dying line of work travel agent commissions suck technical writer pros use research and writing skills( and i did take a technical writing course in college !)apply technical interest and knowledge good pay cons not sure if i can break into that line of work given my unrelated work history will i find it hands on enough to satisfy me ? travel writer pros leverage interest in travel and ability to research and write cons low pay( i.e . staff writer for lonely planet )unless you run your own business and become the next arthur frommer or rick steves , and i ' m not motivated or organized enough to really run my own business hard to break into that world lawyer( in a nontrial capacity !i ' m not confrontational enough to be comfortable arguing in court , and i tend to forget my main points too often to engage in good debate , especially with people i don' t know well )pros excellent pay , potentially interesting work cons three more years of school without the convictionyetthat it would be a rewarding career property investor pros potential for good pay challenging , handson work excuse to travel if i have properties across the country cons takes a little bit of capital to get started.still working on that wink what about other options typically suggested on the lists of careers for types ? i' ve copied the job ideas below from several websites that suggest jobs for types . there are obviously some inaccuracies and conflicts( some sites recommend types to never be accountants , for example ), but in the spirit of looking at all my options , i ' m putting them all here( but will try to eliminate the duplicates ), along with my brief comments . maybe someone can help me narrow my search down . happy( note if i mention something is blue collary , don' t take it as an insult . i just think i need a bit more mental stimulation than that job entails , and i ' m also not good at that stuff. )real estate developer( hmm , how would i get started ? )commercial builder( same as above )stock

manager( not really my goal in life )athletic coach( not into athletics )sports trainer( see above )military officer( i know there' s a thread on types and military that seems to indicate types make good service members , but i tend to side with djarendee' s advice , which indicates the opposite . maybe officers have it better , but i don' t know if i' d last through basic without going nuts from having my individuality taken away from me )police officer( probably a bit too physical for my current capabilities , and cops are too serious )air traffic controller( not really sure i could focus

)securities analyst( let me trade a few stocks first before i become an investment banker )surveyor( meh )truck driver( i like trains , but trucks don' t interest me )electrical technician( meh , and

trains are pretty cool )dental hygienist( dentists have the highest suicide rate of any profession , and they make multiple six figures . i can' t imagine being a dental hygienist is better . and does

really a passion )media specialist( intriguing and perhaps in my line of expertise my concentration at college was telecommunications and film , but what is this , exactly ? )federal manager( probably

entp,"i ' m type . the types i' ve encountered seem very exuberant , but after knowing them( only a couple of women )i get the feeling they are less willing to be in contact with their emotions . is this understanding correct ? it seems confusing to me because i would associate their exuberance with emotions."
intj,"i do understand types can process this and in the meantime stonewall ? but i don' t know what to do moving on forward . i' ve decided to give him space and go on living about my life . i ' m worried about bumping into him in person . any advice or suggestions ? update he has responded apologizing for the late reply but not addressing my point in that i am interested , just standard text . i have accidentally bumped into him after this text but he seemed startled and was avoiding eye contact and only speaking to my friend kind of . i have a feeling he thought it through after the initial interest and maybe does not want to pursue it any further."
enfj,i' ve shut down karens throwing public tantrums over the years and it was satifying for me and everyone else around . i ' m not sure if this is an type thing or if other types do this?
esfj,"i want to confess to this type , but i have doubts. . ok so it' s beenmonths that we' ve known each other . so i ' m running a small cafe and she is my current and only barista( the rest of employees are my family members ). she' sand i am, she still go to college . she wanted to get a parttime job so here we are . i made her took a personality test during the interview . at first, we were pretty professional . but now , i feel like everyday is a date with her lol . it has been like this after we spent the firstweeks . i found so many signs that she' s interested with me more than a friend , here are some strong examples. .she' s blushing everytime we stare at each other . you know , that awkward smile as we both couldn' t contain it any longer lolwhen we' re across the room , i often found that she' s staring or at least paying attention to me and just me .her face is light up everytime i enter the room and smileshe teases me a lot like a lot in a very playful way and sometimes act very silly around me( like , she' s pretending to faint then literally fall on the floor , she' s jumping around like a rabbit as she said goodbye , etc )she leans in and gets closer to me whenever we have conversations , sometimes our body touch . she also sometimes slap my shoulder or arms whenever she gets excited .when there' s no customers , she always ask me to have fun together , like watching movies together or playing games( hago )together . and when we do this , we sit really close sometimes our thighs touch .she always try to keep the conversation going , even sometimes when i ' m busy with my laptop , she keeps bothering me , curious abt what i ' m working on , trying to get my attention in general . i think she doesn' t like it when i ' m ignoring her .everytime she buy or cook food , she either buy it for me too or share her food with me( if she' s lacking money )compliments ? oh cmon , i received this a lot from her . sounds perfect right ? not until , later on , i found out that she has a boyfriend . thanks to my detective capabilities . cough cough well , secret boyfriend , to be specific . so , she never mentioned him at all , even i later realized he ever came to my cafe once , but she only introduced him to me as his friend . wow . she also hides him from public , i think only her very close relatives know the truth about them . there are so many strange things about their relationship though . none of them ever post and brag about them being together on social media publicly . and , compared to her previous bf , this one is totally different , previous one was handsome goodlooking guy while this one is like the total opposite . i am not being racist just spitting fax okayy . i can only assume , is he her rebound or something ? did she get traumatized because handsome guy could ditch her anytime ? but she has been with this guy for almost a year . is rebound even that long ? i don' t think zo . ok , so , damn i ' m so confused man . i have made sure that she doesn' t treat her other male friends like how she treats me . even , she doesn' t play hago with his boyfriend, but only with me !and this few facts below only confuse me even moreshe has made up her mind to make my cafe as her thesis project , and she also want to have an official internship in my cafe . so she planned at leastyear ahead involving me in her life . she also try to find ways to meet with me outside of working hours( she asks my help for her homeworks , teach several subjects , etc. )she even pleaded to me not to leave her for my other job( so i ' m currently looking for a job and have considered to take some time off from my cafe for some period of time )so what she did ? she asked me to give her my cv , then she keeps sending me job recommendations nearby so i won' t be far and still around , since i ever told her i wanted to get a job in foreign countries . she also hates it everytime i have to leave from my cafe for some business reasons , she always show disappointment in her faces and tell me please be quick and come back ok last but not least , she has asked us to take selfies together and she wanted to upload them on social media , but i refused . the first time this happened , it happened during our first week . lol . though we ended up taking selfies and share to each other only . lol idk , maybe because i refused to share them publicly so she thought that i don' t have feelings for her . ey ? i also ever told her that i don' t want people to get the wrong idea about us , i ' m worried it would give negative effects to my cafe since i ' m the owner . but still , she already has boyfriend . why would she even want to do that with me ? she hides her boyfriend but wanted to show me off to the world , wait did i hear that wrong? ? oh , i almost forgot . one night she' s about to buy herself a new eye glasses and asked my opinions as she browsed the marketplaces( we were together sitting on a sofa in my cafe )and she ended up buying with the one i recommended . wait . why didn' t she ask for her bf opinion instead ? i also know that her relationship with her boyfriend is just alright , despite it' s an ldr . so i don' t think she' s trying to make her boyfriend jealous . ok , i originally wanted to confess but i have doubts since i found out about her secret boyfriend . should i confess , or wait for her to make the first move ? i always feel an amazing spark everytime we' re around( idk whether she feels it too or doesn' t )but what i ' m truly sure about is , we' re always having fun whenever we are together , no matter what we do , time just flies . everyday feels like an adventure . one day , there' s a national holiday so i gave herweeks off . you know what happened ? she only tookweek and came back to work without my knowing , i asked her why and she saidstaying in home was very boring and i wanted to surprise you . oh , one more thing , we are asians . so please consider that sex is pretty much taboo here and how it affects the culture of how we show and display love in general( not as casual and straightforward as the western' s )can' t wait to hear your opinions , my fellow cyber friends"
enfp," please note that i am not stereotyping anyone. people with said types can also be good or bad depending on the circumstance . this is just my experiences with a messy relationship breakup i have been in a poly relationship for the lastyears with two people(one was an type and the other an type ). with the type we get into argumentsm but the love is always there and its very intense . the type on the other hand ,while we clicked in terms of socialpop culture views , they treated me as if i was nothing . he has caused so much mental trauma added on to other trauma that i am even trying to piece together from past situations . this past trauma is from childhood onward( in a terrible fisi loop). i felt no love . i was just a status symbol in this persons mind . when i broke up with this person , the reaction was nothing i ever expected . they just felt . . unphased . showed that this person never even cared that we were both going to be ex' s going forward and that things would never be the same again . just a minor inconveniance in life for him is how i interpreted it . felt like theyears we' ve been together was just a joke . even after breaking up with this person , it has caused after effects . i have basically become a cynic . as if i hate society and how it functions and that my ideals will never get to that point within myself . i have had panic attacksanger outbursts due to events that he was directly or indirectly caused . i question who i am or what i am anymore . a hollow shell of what i originally am(tho the drive for social issues is still there maybe a bit stronger than before ). the type tries to calm me down and tells me everything will be ok, but its just not good enough . cause i know itll never be good enough . types can be bubbly and fun and positive , but i think people do not realize is that if you push them down far enough , it will change the person forever and can damage the type to their lowest points(possibly permanently) ."
estj,"my dad is type and the only time when he tells a lie is when he is trying to protect himself from revealing too much personal information , other times he' s quite honest and blunt about things . even when telling jokes , it tends to be on the ironicside of things . does this stem from being a tedomfiinferior ? any other explanations you can think of?"
isfp,"dear types , what are your thoughts on types ? have you ever been friends with one , or even in a romantic relationship with one ? if not , would you? ? p.s . i urge you to be as honest and blunt as possible . i sincerely want to know your honest opinion of them? i will take no offense as an type myself."
enfj,"types , please tell me about your anger . what upsets you ? what does it take for you to get really angry ? what happens when you become angry ? do you yell ? become verbally or physically aggressive ? lose control ? do tell."
esfp,"hi . i know there' s only so much you guys might be able to say regarding this without actually knowing him . but i ' m mostly just looking for some general information to go off of . for starters i' ll tell you a bit of backstory . we met at work aroundmonths ago , instantly realized we got along , and soon got close . we didn' t start dating up until about a month ago , though , because i was dating someone else at the time . so far , i' d say things are going well . we rarely run out of things to talk about . he' s sweet to me and very considerate . the physical chemistry is honestly fucking awesome . but i ' m already noticing a few things that make me feel a little uneasy . i ' m naturally a people pleaser i enjoy being submissive to others in every day life , but especially someone i ' m dating . i' ve told him that and he doesn' t seem to have any issue with it . he calls me sweet , cute , caring , etc . , etc . often so i know he acknowledges this about me . the problem is that i ' m not a very logical thinker honestly and he has corrected me a handful of times , pointing out logical inconsistencies fairly regularly . it doesn' t bother me to realize he' s right and try to learn from my mistakes . what bothers me is feeling like the more he has to do that , the less respect he might start to have for me . it' s hard to feel like i ' m doing much right if he' s so often pointing out things i ' m doing wrong . also , anxiety is a thing for me . i ' m an enneagram( pretty sure he' s aby the way, )and i worry when i feel like my actions are inadvertently causing someone distress . i seem to have a deep rooted fear of people telling me things are okay when they' re not . i think this annoys him a bit , though he has had patience so far . but as much as i try not to worry and voice my worries , it' s difficult when it seems like something bad could happen if i don' t . i' ve always been this way and am actually much better than i used to be . one more thing i went to a party his friends were having the other night . he seemed happy with the fact that i was willing to do that . i would say i was at least a little awkward , since i really don' t party much at all . and i don' t know , i guess i just get concerned about things like that . none of this is to say that i can' t be alone , or that i don' t have my own needs . my own needs are just often at the backburner of my mind , which i usually don' t mind . as for being alone , i think it' s just that i think about these things solely when i ' m in a relationship . for example , if it were to end tommorow for some reason , i know i would bounce back eventually . but in the constructs of a relationship , i just don' t want to be the cause for an end."

infj,"today , i cried together with the men of my church over the loss of one of our brothers . i never met this person his name is albert . i have not been going to the church long , but only a month ago , at this same kind of monthly saturday meeting , albert was there . and now , he is gone . the occasion is simply a men' s breakfast for men of the church , to come together and pray and engage in fellowship . this time was different in that just this morning , news of the loss of albert due to cancer finally landed . it was the first time i attended this kind of meeting . the men at the church are good men . many are ranking military members . the friendliness they share is something i have not seen at any other church so far( i have visited quite a few churches in the past year ). it' s genuine and real in a way that is hard to explain . they are strong and intelligent , and you would not expect it , nor is it probably known outside , except for somewhat anonymous places like this , that aroundmen sat and prayed for an hour reminiscing and crying about a lost brother . again , i never met albert , but i cried for his loss all the same . i could feel the emotion in the room and it is not something i can ignore , nor want to . i wish i were able to know this man . i wish i knew him sooner . when compelled to add my words into the group prayer , for this man i never met , i spoke about how even though i do not know him , one day i will . i reminded the others one day , they will know him again , too . and through this loss , although my tears were for those hurting men and the loss of a brother , i could not help but reminisce on my own personal loss . in the past year , i gained a wife , a son , a daughter a family . and in the past year i lost a wife , a son , and a daughter by lost , i mean in the sense of the wordnot someone passing away . i have lost my family not just my immediate , but the extended family as well . the mother in law , father in law , brother in law , a couple aunts in law and more . i cannot express how painful that is , however , i am thankful to have gained regardless of the loss . i had a family i loved , and then had that special part of me cut out from my life . the only way to endure loss like this is to know that god is in charge . if i did not have god to rely on during times like this , i would be destroyed . through my suffering , i grow closer to god , relying on him more and more , witnessing his goodness in my life even when the purpose of it all is unclear to me . after the breakfast , there was talk of helping put up a pavilion outside behind the church . a text message was sent out , but as i ' m new , i didn' t get it . still , i walked outside and made my way to the fresh concrete pad , where the main frame of the pavilion was already in place . slowly others gathered outside , and with the ease and comfort that only exists in a wellregulated military unitor , in a church that is beyond goodwe all came together to put the rest of the pavilion together , which consisted mainly of a segmented roof that was tricky to line up . a couple of the young mensons of some of the men who were at the breakfastalso helped out . we lifted the pieces , screwed them into the frame , then undid the work and repositioned and did all manner of pulling and pushing and lifting to get the pieces all in place . we talked and laughed and moved multiple ladders around and took our time with only one power drill helping to do all the work . i especially enjoyed helping the younger meni ' m not sure their age , maybeorin using a ratchet socket wrench and explaining without judgment the good ways to operate it . one of these guys i could tell did not have experience with the socket wrench , so i explained the mechanics of it in a nonjudgmental way and , as it' s very simple , he caught on quickly and so on . it was good to be able to teach like this. . it' s hard to explain. . and i only did because no one else noticed the difficultyno one else was paying as close attention to everything going on . all the safety , how well things were bolted or screwed in , how things were positioned and so on , i ensured i paid attention and ensured the directions were followed for assembly as best as i couldnot that i was alone in this , but i did my part . so noticing the little things about the socket wrench and so on , where a young man will just do not knowing differently and not wanting to seem like he doesn' t know. . anyway. . pointing it out in such a way. . it was good. . he and i talked later and there' s a respect earned , like i would assume a teacher receives , when a situation like this is handled with care . it can' t really be described , because it' s personal and wouldn' t make sense . it was just really good . the head pastor came by nearing when we were finishing and the energy was nothing different , still family the pastor joking with some of the other men , and just having a good time . he ended up ordering us pizza before he left , and most of the men left by then as well as most of the bulk work getting the roof pieces were done . we finished up i put the last screws in around the corners of the roof , where those screws were skipped initially because it would be too hard to get them in due to the roof overhang . i. . could not accept that. . so for myself , when all other steps were complete , i took care of that bit to ensure the corner brackets looked nice and didn' t have holes with no screws in them . just a personal thing . we went inside , and ate some pizza . i sat and listened . a couple of the guys talked about basketball . not my thing . i just listened with curiosity . and then , naturally. . we were all done . we got up , went outside , said byeuntil tomorrow , sunday , for church , of course !as i walked around the building towards my car. . some emotion hit me again . i wish i were going home to my family . being part of this church family is amazing , and i ' m so thankful for it . then , going home , i have no one to greet me . no one to tell this story to . so i resort to posting about it here to the somewhat anonymous world , so i can document that today happened . i feel the loss experienced , as well as that which i' ve gained , simultaneously my soul like a rubber band pulled taught between the extremes . and i cry."

isfp,"i was originally drawn to the typing systems hoping they would help me choose the right careerbetterpaying occupation . my search for a career path grew into a desire to understand who i really am . it also led me to finally begin trying to manage my internal challenges . throughout these processes , i have been guilty of anxiously obsessing about my types and identity . eventually , i relaxed and accepted that these typing systems are tools at best , which might help us better understand ourselves . so , i ask you why did you originally try to type yourself ? was it in the hopes of finding a career path ? improved selfknowledge ? help with personal problems ? wanted to understand better how you are received by others ? what was the impact ? did typing yourself lead to a better understanding of yourself ? do you appreciate others more ? did it help you choose a new occupationcareer path ? did it have negative impacts ? did you put yourself in a box ? did you mistype yourself and why did you think that happened ? thanks to anyone who responds."
infp,it' s a simple question . are types prone to narcissim ? what do you think?
istj,"hi types , your insight and advice will be much appreciated . for aboutyears now we haven' t been talking to my husband?s family . his type step mom his type dad , type brother and type sister . my husband is a type and i am a type . the relationship between him and them was basically that he was the scape goat of the family . everyone was allowed to get angry except him . they are used to him groveling and complying with their wishes . they do not see this . they just see that he acts differently than they would , then they get mad and ?hurt ? by it and then he apologizes and hides the real him from them . now , the real him is not some crazy person or anything . the real him is someone who makes his own decisions , is devoted to his family , and who is almost finished with a fantasy novel ? but that is way far out there for this family . my relationship has been rocky from the beginning . i hate how they treat him and they don?t understand me and tend to make wild assumptions and treat me the way they do my husband . basically i need to always be in the wrong according to them . my husband said even while we were dating that the best thing would be to move to a different state . so afteryears of marriage we moved to a different state . i found the right comparable job with an increase in our dream town where we wanted to retire anyway . they couldn?t comprehend it and thought we were trying to ?find ourselves ? or something . before we left and why we left i found out they had basically hadthanksgivings ,wish us and one without us . i decided then to start looking in the town we wanted to move to for a job . the weekend before we left his sister had a family dinner but didn?t invite us . they had a phone feed without us and with us for aboutyears before we left . they kept using language like ?them ? and ?us ? which i am using now because we aredistinct groups now.however when i started to hear those kinds of separating words i knew it was time to move no matter how good my job was or the kids ? school . my husband was getting very hurt to be so ostracized . we still were not planning to break things off or anything , but my husband decided he was sick of being treated poorly on the phone even and i agreed . i wasn?t going to put up with them thinking everything i did was wrong . i told my husband he could deal with them.i was going to be happy . this was all excruciating for my husband who had always been close to his family , but they were treating him like an outcaste . he called his dad and told his dad that he felt he wasn?t getting treated like the other kids . his dad then leveled a page ofthings we did ?wrong? ? to us these are things we would choose to do again , they were things like buy a dog , ask for help trying to get to a grandmother?s funeral , not following advice we had never actually heard but that they thought we should have asked for , being ungrateful for things we didn?t think happened( my mother in law thinks she saved my life , even when the facts show otherwise ). that kind of stuff . stuff that had always come up but that were a problem because of us thinking that we are adults . we can have a dog if we want to and them thnking we are not adults and need to do what they say . i?myears old by the way . their other kids do what they say and they reap financial benefits . we do t want this kind of relationship , not the kind of relationship they want . we want a relationship based on common respect( the respect you have when you realize people are probably right about making decisions for themselves since they have to live with the consequences and have different circumstances and skills and resources than you , and love . my husband loves his family dearly . his dad was a single dad with him for a while , they had a deep bond as long as my husband played the scape goat game . my husband hardly ever says a word to even stand up for himself , we both kind of have a feeling that saying nothing when confronted with ridiculousness is being the bigger person . we had assumed that these guys must know deep inside that they are being unreasonable . i no longer think this is the case . anyway , my husband tried to show our side of thethings . things that we thought they would suddenly realize they were in the wrong about and realize that they had been extremely hurtful . no such thing . his dad just kept coming back to crazy stories that never happened but that allow them to think the worst . supposedly they think we both quit out jobs to go on welfare at some point. . just weird . i heard my husband talking and i heard him start to appologize and to pretend he had been depressed and that?s why we had moved how we did and i said , ?get off the phone , they are makng you feel like you have to be wrong again to be accepted ! ? ? at that point my husband realized he really couldn?t talk to them and be himself at all . a few months later he tried again to ask they he and his dad talk , but with respect . his dad said , ?we will listen and then you will listen to us . it would take years to undo the hurt you?ve caused this family ! ? ? we declined . a year later my husband tried again , his dad basically said they have written us off . so .years . my husband wants contact , but he doesn?t want to be disrespected . our therapist( yes we have one )says his family is a lost cause . my husband is too loving of a person to not want to heal this and he knows how he could do it in a flash . all he would have to say is how wrong he was . we could pretend to follow all of their unsolicited advice , or tell them we are going to do something else , and they get mad and we hear about it for years . at various times i have tried to explain that i want respect to mother my own children without following their ways( my children are well behaved , i have no need to use physical punishment thank you )and that the way we make decisions makes sense in our situation . if we were rich like them , maybe i?d buy the car they thought i should get , but as it is i can only buy what i can afford , etc . reasons like this haven' t made much difference in what they think of me . to me , this is all confusion . they think i am what i?m not and they think that i should do what they want . they are confused on both principals . last night my husband couldn?t sleep . he was upset with all this , worried his parents will have bad health and he cares about them . he wants to be reconciled . i?m sorry this wasn?t shorter , but if i stated less , i don?t think it would have given a full picture . is there a way to state things ? is there a way to present this case ? i think the fact that his other siblings still do everything their parents say is kind of telling . still , we are in another state after all , maybe there is a way . but my husband will never act like he is less than he is again i don?t think . i wouldn?t want him to . your thoughts , please."
esfp,"i' ve been seeing this girl for aboutmonths now( both). and cuz of our work schedules , we' ve been doing somedates a week( going out , staying over , etc ). things had been great until recently when a lot of shit came up in her life at once( landlord trouble , losing her credit card , workload increase ). so we haven' t seen each other in likeweeks now . i' ve tried to be in contact with her . it was really difficult for me cuz her work hours are long and she can' t use her phone during that time . so i' d drop texts to see how she was or to ask if she needed me for anything but a lot of times they' d completely go unanswered the whole day , even when she was back home . she' d not return calls . she' d text me that she' d call and she won' t . i finally gave in and told her that i was trying to be understanding and suportive but this lack of communication was killing me that i was hurt and feeling like being taken for granted and this seemed too onesided . she seemed very sad and said she never meant to hurt me . that she' s just the kind of person who feels i should only see the best side of her and not the side when she' s crying or stressed and not being herself . i told her that i really wanted to know all her sides and be of help when need be . that i felt like i was being pushed away and had no clue of what was happening in her life . i' ll be honest here . these pastweeks have made me a bit insecure in the relationship and i ' m not even someone who feels that way , ever . i' d have called it quits by now with someone else and this already came close . but she is such an amazing girl i think this is worth the effort . it just seemed to me like i was trying so desperately to be there for her and she didn' t give a damn about any of it . my ego was giving in . do types under stress behave this distant always ? or is it a clash between my type fe and her fi ? cuz if this continues any longer , i might just lose interest and i' d really hate for that to happen . sent from my lenovo aa using tapatalk"
enfp,"dear all persons with the typet personalty . i ' m in a situation that i truly desire some advice from your intuitive , feeling , and creative character because i deeply fall in love with someone of your kind but she has a boyfriend in her current love situation . firstly because you probably recognize what is happening to her because you know what you are . i can feel what you are but can' t understand many things about you . secondly , you are so social creatures that i trusted my thoughts to you the most of all kinds of personalities . when i met her first time . my thoughts were she was filtring with me but my feelings told me that it' s her natural reaction . she was quickly starting me to trust her secrets such ass that my brother( protagonist )was her deepest love . i was feeling that it still . she also said that we are giving off similar energy . at the end of the day , we said to ourselves good night and that was the end of the day . the next morning we took a picture together for breakfast and she send this picture to my brother but then i must go to work . it was some have how that her friend need something at the same place . then i was feeling the love between those ( he is her current boyfriend ( he was not her boyfriend in this time). but she was using this situation to say hello to me and to invite me to hike on the hill . the next day i saw on facebook that those have an adventurous trip together . in the next few days , i was so nervous about why we still didn' t go hiking on the hill ( i assume that she is so spontaneous ). that is why i asked her if we go on this hill and we went . on this mountain . on hiking , she was curious about what i write . with her , we have also talked about politics and philosophy where we have strictly the same opinion . but i most admired how is she deep emotional connected to nature . in the next few days , we didn' t talk but she invite me to a meeting of the local group for climate justice . we have corporate with others on political action . then i didn' t her saw for a month that is why i invite her to the same hill but she was home more precisely she study in my home city and don' t live in my home city . then we stop talking for half a year . then i did another action whit this local group for climate justice . that trigged that she message on me that she congrats me for a successful campaign . then debate went to that if i still writing and that she fell in love with somebody . the next topic was that i did get a job as a production worker in the factory . i feel that she is so scary because of that more precisely i use antidepressive and other pills . she desired that i give her a promise that i would quit the job if i feel physiology bad while i working . i thank her for her protective feeling and gave her a promise . i became so emotional that wrote an essay in which i told her why i fell in love with her and i gave the promise that i won' t be rude to her , my final thoughts were that i both of them thanks for my enjoying in while i was writing and said that i desire that they experience beautiful emotions of love . she responded the cool way furthermore that was easy so touching that she cried . she also said that love my promise plus that she will always be my friend and fighter against climate change . the next thing that happen is that she was so relieved when i told her that didn' t get the job . after that , we almost went film festival but she got seek don' t get me wrong i believed her . next month we were regularly in contact by internet . then she told me that she will go to another country for a year . similar to a situation when she fell in love i got similar way emotions mostly because i was thought that she will finally come to my hometown . i told her that i desire to see her before she leaves . on that night i gave her a gift and that was menstrual wash pads with these types of trousers and , of course , a distilled bag for distribution . she responded that is a genius gift . and i need to admit that enjoy the time i spend with her because she found the movie that i love to watch . i felt that she recognized my passion for movies . i mean that is why she organized our meeting as a movie night . but it was not everything so perfect . i felt her cold all night . i also open the debate of the essay and she said that it was sweet of me because i don' t hide my feelings . while was bicycling home i was all the time scary because she was so cold . i close my eyes with the thought that important her exams made her stressed and that was why she was cold . we were in touch on the internet but she didn' t tell me about the exams . that is why asked her if she passed them but she told me that she didn' t and she will not leave the country this year . the thing i need to report to you is that i wrote a critic about her favorite movie and she admired this essay . then we won' t be in touch for while but she invited me to some project of a local activist in her town . we met in the cafe bar where we mostly debate about the project but it was also a friendship meeting . she also told me that her boyfriend was scared when he saw a line of our conversation . she was not so cold this time i imagine her in my imagination as a character in my story who is transformed into the real world( it' s not the same ). that' s is the reason that i deeply love her . i desired to be close to her because she gives me a safe environment for communication . of course , i desire to know will be my dreams will become true or if i have a chance i fell in love whither . but more importantly , i need to know if it something wrong with her and how can i help her if something is wrong because i feel still some coldest in her . of course the turbulent mediator writed this."

entp,"so i was perusing a blog called mbti truths , and found a post about type' s being the best type . interesting read , but the real diamond in the rough was this comment( warning it' s a monsterread lol )here' s my take with all the dirt . an type looks great from the outside because we make you laugh , we give you true insightful criticism , we know all about your interests , and really understand you we know logically why you feel like you do , even if you don' t . we find creative why didn' t i think of that solutions to not only your life problems but your computer problems too . we can charm your grandparents , your parents , and your friends . we can party with the extraverts , and sit in silence with the introverts . we can talk trek with nerds , and baudelaire with artsyfartsies . you probably didn' t notice us in high school because we were in our embryonic pseudotypetype morph . but you got surprised when you saw us back from college break and though we looked different( aka more desirable ). we seem now just oh so dreamy and exciting . but all that takes a lot of energy . it' s a performance we put on tailor made , on the spot , just for you . eventually we get tired and the mask slips off . that' s when you think we' re shallow or selfcentered , but the truth is , you misunderstood our performance for personal interest .( and maybe we did tooit' s easy to lose yourself as a method actor. )but we' re just as cold and analytical ruthless as the other nts we don' t nitpick you apart like an type , or categorize your usefulness like an type , or test your mental capacity like an type . we understand you by( subconsciously )pushing all your secret buttonskfor good or bad . maybe you fell in love with us , but now your angry and conflicted because you don' t understand why we' re suddenly being cold and distant . we' ve retreatedbecause while we' re good at faking emotion , and logically understanding why people feel a certain way , we' re really terrible at actually handling emotion . we get overpowered by it and annoyed by the illogicalness of it .(besides , we' ve already found a new shiny. )now you hate uskbut here is some consolation . we have a builtin nemesis and he' s a real bastard . we turn that critical wideranging eye on ourselves . you can' t see it from the outside , but were utter perfectionists in our heads and we relentlessly measure ourselves against the realistically unachievable . somehow we can' t find the same easy solutions to our problems as to everyone else' s , and we become mired in too many possibilities , haunted by how inadequate our own creative efforts seem to us . we at once believe our own hype , and ruthlessly condemn ourselves . we' ll may you our creations( probably somethingfinished ). we secretly want your praise , like anyo child . we don' t accept your garlands though( unless you' re an expert we respect )because we' ve already judged ourself against perfection and came out wanting . if you tell us you think it' s good , we won' t believe you . for what you mistook as bravado and arrogance , is really very wry , very sarcastic selfmortification . we can stagnate in our mess of ideas , with no external system of organization to help us move forward . we have brief mad rushes of energy back , forward , right , left , a random walk of ideas with a net movement of zero . if you' re really smart , being an type is a double cursekbecause your ideas are loftier , your movements more wideranging , your internal critic all the more perniciously accurate . you stand on the shoulders of titans , glimpsing something wonderful across the jungle of possibilities , and sketch out a map . but then it happens sj reality . they turn off your water because you forgot to pay the bill . a check bounces because you didn' t know how much money you had in the account . you burn dinner because you' re suddenly obsessed with typing out a manifesto on a blog . you tell a friend you' ll meet him atand show up at. you forget to call your mother on her birthday . you put off simple annoyances( like depositing a check )for weeks . your mighty creative intuition gets mostly employed to talk your way out of the stupid jams your procrastination landed you in . people with lesser talents , pass you by and you make excuses( the internal critic says it' s because your stupid and lazy ). you don' t get the promotion because while you have a lot of good ideas , you don' t follow through . you' re unreliable . you have no problems expressing your boredom with your job or critiquing your boss publicly in front of his superiors , not realizing the implications . sj boss now really doesn' t like you . you get a' s in some college classes and f' s in othersbut all your nt professors still think you' re intelligent , even the one' s giving your f' s , because they' ve fallen for your charms and excuses . but people like youthey think your unique , clever and entertaining , because you are . they give you chances . so you pick yourself up , dust yourself off from your failures , and try again . maybe you get your self another brilliant type friend and start apple computer . or write candide . or invent quantum electrodynamics . or host the daily show . maybe tomorrow . or next week . but what you' ll probably do , instead of working on finishing a paper your supposed to be readying for peer review , you' ll spend an hour typing out a cathartic blog post that' s maybe more about your own insecurities than being an type . so is type the best of all the types ? hell yes it is .)

enfj,"so i matched with really gorgrous type on tinder lol.anyway we been texting for about a month now and he still has been too busy to make time to meet up with me . ive never dealth with an type before so would like some advise ? im an type btw so giving me definitive responses and schedules are important , and it drives me insane when i have to wait for any confirmation . this is how it all went down . at first his responses were short and shallow . i would start conversations where his response was one word and he wouldnt follow up questions or comments which can make the conversation keep going . however he always responded withinmins . thats why i kept being patient because when someone i didn' t want to talk to messaged me i would rarely ever respond . the only time he would put more effort into the was after midnight . at first i thought its because he was horny and wanting to sext . later he told me its because he finishes work around that time so his replies were not so abrupt . the conversations at that time however , would always somehow lead up to something sexual.that bothered me . so eventually after i asked , he agreed to meet up with me on his day off( tuesday ). tuesday morning this is how the conversation went me hey still good for today ? him yeah i am looking forward to it !i ' m going to the dojo be back inhours me ok have fun(hours later. )him i fucked up. . me ok ? him i twisted my knee doing spin sorry we gotta post pone . but i heal fast so this was super coincidental to me and i had a suspicion it was a last minute ditch because he either got cold feet or was unsure or whatever reason . we continue talking for the next few days until i got annoyed at his wishy washyness and went offff at him . me look i ' m pretty much done with this . you don' t put in any effort . when you cancel a plan at least arrange another date to meet up . it feels like you don' t even want to see me . him i do , i really like you . if you can' t see that then its on you . me yeah again , if someone wants to see someone the i ' m busy excuse is a load of crap . there' shours in a day , its not that hard to set aside one hour to have coffee . im so over this him so you' re leaving me ?( i literally rolled my eyes when he said that because it just seemed manipulative )me i want you to at least admit you had no intentions of meeting me and didn' t want to put any effort . then this can be over and done with . i told you i been used and treated like a piece of meat in the past and its upsetting that you are doing it to me too . the least you can do is to be honest with me him ok youre right i didn' t make any effort and i was leading you on . i don' t know why i did it . i really don' t . im really sorry . i wish i could tell you why i did it but i can' t . me thanks that' s all i wanted to hear . him but its true i really do like you . listen i finish work at pm tonight can i give you a call ? we could talk over the phone then decide what we both want to do ? so he calls me , we chat for hours while he was babysitting his cousin . then when his uncle came home he got off the phone , drove him and proceeded to call me again at his own initiative . so i was happy about that . he said he felt alot more relaxed and really wanted to meet me after the long call . he also explained he works alot because his dad doesn' t have a job at the moment and his mum has been sick for a year so only he and his brother works . he also said he would try to to see me this week me soooo hows this week looking ? him my boss arrives at pm ill ask her to give me a day off then( after pm )me?? him this week im the only one on shift who has a liscense and she can' t give me any day off .hour shift and sat is my mum' s birthday . me oh all good i understand him i will ask my boss on thurs about next week k ? me what if she says no him then we will plan around it . anyways i kinda have this ominous feeling there will be more excuses again . i really don' t get his behavior . maybe i am not giving him a wow factor to want to be anxious to see me ? how do i get him excited to me ? what do you types like talking about that keeps you captivated by someone ? and no , don' t tell me to give up on him . i ' m not ready to yet . not until ive exhausted all options , which at this point i feel i had not yet . also do types like ppl chasing them or does it make them less inclined to be interested ? i really am clueless when dealing with types . the thing is he always responds to me very quickly and all the time . which i view as a good sign . and he has warmed up to me more and more but i have yet to get a definitive response as to when he will lock in a solid plan to meet up."

entj,are cheating to help oneself deal breakers for types?
entj,"i was interested in this type which he may have noticed but i was never obvious about it and didn?t pursue him at all . we work together and see each other daily . we had a moment of intimacy( no sex )which was intense and he was all enthusiastic about it , then he ?disappeared? ? ( just on a personal level , which made working together weird for a while ). then we had another moment , same thing happened . got over it again . few months later he tells me he wants this , but in the past he wasn?t ready because he was in a bad place separating from his long term partner , finding a new place to live etc . but now he wants it . he shows vulnerability for the first time which makes me think he means it . i now see the typical type aggressive pursuing behaviour , it?s intense and frequent for a few days , texts quickly get sexual( though i?m holding back a bit more than him , don?t wanna give it to him on a silver plate ), buys me sexy lingerie . then texts get less feequent . i always mirror the other persons behaviourfrequency etc . then he disappears again . we talk at work , about work , as if nothing happened , but nothing else . i?ve been elegant and diplomatic , acting professional. . but , i?m just so frustrated and fing confused , i just don?t understand the behaviour and feel like screaming at him for being an asle towards me . does anyone understand this and any suggestions how to handle it?"
intp,"i' ve tested mbti questions several times , ends up withresults , typet for most of the time and typettimes . my dominant mbti personality test results suggest that i ' m typet but my thought and behaviour says otherwise . i ' m going to share some of my lifestory . get ready because some of this probably sounds cringeyi' ve always crave for a love partner ( fi )despite not meeting with other people often because of my slacking life . in the same time , i think it is better( ti i assume )to improve my social interaction due to my tendency of ghosting in whatsapp ( sounds like a stereotypical type ). after myself in isekai animes ( any type of anime actually ), marvel and researching superpowers( superpower wiki ), i' d thought ( ti )that what if our reality had superpowers ? wouldn' t it be a better world , especially towards me being too lazy to do something?wouldn' t it savebenefit people ( fe )more with their own personal problems ? . i' ve ended up wishing ( fi )to have a reality bending power and create the world to possibly exist but managed to be pragmatic in the same time and suppressed those dreams . i' ve keep why god would create such a pathetic world even if it could be turn out better . lastly , i can talk normally with people but there are times where i had problem talking face to face ( infer . fe ) .in the same time , i' ve quickly get overwhelmed and becomes panicky but managed to remain calm when i couldn' t answer a hard questions ( mostly exam questions.i shrugged my shoulders if with people ), when i' ve done something embarassing and when i ' m talking in front of many people like during a presentation . i seriously thought that i ' m an type because of my emotional approach on doing things but my mbti results says otherwise . it wasn' t until i' ve discovered enneagram and done the test hoping that it could give more insights about my personality . i' ve gotten w the philospher which is quite common among types and research on what are the characteristics of an type w . i' d had been many websites for an explanation and stumbled upon a quora question and a personality cafe forum that got my attention what' s an type w like ? answer(of)this will be a long narration and even a semistorytelling from me , as i have been trying to find the right identity for myself , recently being which is the correct enneagram typing for me and yes , why don' t i share it here ? have fun reading)a short briefing of each labeling. . www.quora.com typetype , enneagram w and art there appears to a tendency among types that are enneagram w and music preference . specifically , it appears that the w type seeks music that is focused on connection and disconnection . i don' t think we need to go further into the specifics of the type or the definitions of cognitive. . www.personalitycafe.com apparently , an type with w enneagram types tend to be emotional and creative which makes them often mistaken for an type , which goes back to my original question how similar are type w and an type p.s sorry for my english grammar . i ' m not an english speaker."
isfp,"i found that i am getting married to an type girl . although marriage isn' t completely fixed , i would like to know compatibility between type woman and type man . what kind of relationship problems an typetype had faced . what was the role ? it would be helpful for me to be aware of general problems , misunderstandings in the relationship . thank you."
intj,"hey all . i have a book titled timelines for everything( a smithsonian picture encyclopedic book )which documentsbillion years of historical events and i ' m working towards committing it all( events and dates )to memory in the space ofmonths or less . it just occurred to me how grandiose that task isthe book lists, historical events . i ' m curious to know if you' ve done something similar and what your experiences are ? i ' m using the memory palace approach of course , but don' t have an intuitive sense of how to construct the abstraction for, events."
istj,"people of the type subforum , i just arrived but i can' t stop noticing how this place got a huge problem due to the nature of mbti . let me start by saying most of mbti' s descriptions of types make no sense to me , since they mix elements of two types usually( i mean obviously for the introverts ). truth is , this place is full of tise people . you know , those people who usually relate well to the mbti type descriptions and don' t care as much about the functions ? yeah , they lead with a rational function and tend to be way more organized and tidy . sites on the other hand. . we can be industrious of course , serious. . but our natural state is of relaxation . we are the true perceivers . the world lazy does apply way more to us . not to tises . we are perceiving pragmatists . our focus is on harmony( mostly inner physical harmony ). of course you won' t understand if you' ve always only studied the functions on mbti sites , since they are usually broken , but if you actually start reading jung' s psychological types over again , and focus on socionics 'descriptions of the types you will end up with the same conclusion . thus , people , will this continue being a nest for both lsis and slis or will we make this important decision together ? will people who only relate to the work work work stereotype realize they can' t be si doms ? thank you for the attention . and let the shitstorm begin."
enfp,"first of all , i ' m not a native english speaker . so please don' t read too much into the words now i am an type . and socially , though people don' t really despise my company , but i can assure you i ' m not a very good storyteller !i mean i make jokesnall but generally they involve witty retorts or some funny observations . and mostly these are' oneliners '!i am not very good at telling funny lifeincidents in detail . even if i initiate a topic , i would makeopening statements and right away ask a question to the other person( unless the topic involves things which fly and go backandforth in time!)in short , if one can make a transcript of my communication , you will mostly seeline paragraphs , but rarely a seriously long paragraph( as we often get to see in typeforums hence the questions how do types tell such long but engaging stories? do you think it came naturally to you or you improved over time? thanks  !

intp,finally all my questions can now beor will be answered as the software advances even more in the future . i wish i can have a robot friend as smart as chatgpt in the future
entp,"i' ve always seemed to be able to get a group of people to listen , understand , and believe my words . even though i have no clue what' s going on , or what i ' m talking about . i ' m somehow able to get them to follow my lead , and still have absolutely no clue what the fuck i ' m doing . so i' ve been wondering who else here is able to do this as well?"
entp,"just like the title says , cause i know were just that great . all types welcome . let' s get it on ! "
istp,"so i got thinking , again . types are known as the rebel types . we very rarely conform to any particular norm and when we even sense that we are we immediately rebel against it . we do things against others wishes . we don' t care for most people in general . and we generally don' t like being controlled . does that mean are actions are spiteful in nature as most of our actions are in effect rebellious against the norm ? can we really be detached completely from petty emotions when we take these actions ? and what if we aren' t aware of it?"
estp,"why is it that a lot of type?s feel the need to win at any sort of competition , often getting angry when they lose . even when playing something as inconsequential as rock paper scissors . even michael pierce used the word ?conquerer ? to describe them in his first type video"
intp,"shit i need help . i ' m new to relationships because i only really became open to the possibility this year . but do any other types have relationship issues . as in whenever you see the person or going to see the person youre in a relationship with , you get anxiety ? i ' m not good at any part of the relationship . i got anxiety so bad that i ended up having health problems because of my anxiety and stress levels reached a new high . don' t get me wrong you like the person you' re seeing . but something in you ends up thinking that relationships don' t feel realistic . they feel like they don' t belong with other forms of interaction and because of this sporadic variable , you don' t feel in control . do you guys have this ? also , do you worry about wasting your time if it doesn' t go right ? i don' t know how to control it . i feel fine when i ' m with them , but i can feel the anxiety rising as time goes on . especially after leaving them . but i know this is something i' ve got to get used to . i don' t talk to many people at all . i don' t have friends so this is a big step for me . especially because the guy im seeing is an extrovert . if you types have in fact experienced this , can you let me know how you got over it ? please not just time . it can be some sort of thought psychology that you had , some mentality . it can be actual physical methods . i don' t care . just anything."
entp,"i redid the quiz on this site( plus another more elaborate one on another site )and both ended up giving me type. spot on i' d say especially the clingy part . whenever i get pissed off or hurt my first instinct is to find someone i can bug . i probably think it' s a nurture thing too since my mom pampered me to death . having some exes who did the same didn' t help matters eitheranyhow , i know mbti and enneagrams exist on two different planes . but is a typetype strange or what ? "
enfj,"ok guys , so this one is going to be a bit of a long one . just a fair disclaimer for those who might be clicking onto this . i' ve got plenty of story to tell , however , out of respect for the subject , i' ll be being very vague . so i ' m an type first off , and a pretty welldeveloped one , i would say . not to toot my own horn or anything , but it is what it is . anyways , i' ve got a fairly long sexual history , but i put it all away to be with this one woman who is indeedyears older than me , however , arguably when it comes to maturity , i ' m fairly certain that i win out . to be succinct on this post , this woman has been through a hell of a lot .kids with the fathers nowhere near in the picture , several broken relationships w abuse and or manipulation . a family that' s no longer involved etc . so that has taken it' s toll on her . nonetheless , she is still a mentally , physically , and emotionally beautiful woman at her best . unfortunately , a few weeks after we started dating , a lot of things happened in her life which set her back tremendously and also brought up a stressful image of the woman that i knew .( this stressed version of her still has not went anywhere and her children and i notice it constantly. )luckily we got through all of those problems that arose with the exception of her car .( she has been carless for weeks now. )we moved in together , a move , of which i thought would set things on the right course . unfortunately for us , things haven' t improved . ok , now that i have provided some context to this post , it' s time to really preface with some details on our relationship .we have been dating forweeks . of which , throughout that time , i' ve made several changes to my lifestyle to accommodate( per her desire ), in not letting my parents be anywhere near as intrusive into my personal life as they have been , cutting off and avoiding much contact with other females in professional and casual contexts .( i don' t interact much with women anyways , despite the fact that they flirt with me often. )i' ve softened up quite a bit giving her warm affirmations often , proclaiming my love for her as well as undying dedication to building with her , and going the extra mile in arguments to avoid being my typical asshole self . these are huge changes for me as they' re quite contradictory to my normal and nonromantic self , however , i ' m not quite dismayed or even put off by this . i have no compunctions about this , except for the fact that she still doubts , whether or not i ' m entirely faithful , care about her , and at times even want to be in a relationship despite several conversations and arguments about this as well as me having gone the extra mile to show through actions( helping out and mentoring as well as doing some providing for her kids , letting her have a fingerprint on my phone to which she typically uses to look through it constantly citing that she is just being' nosy 'etc. )i' ve never been unfaithful or even given off any sort of signs of infidelity . still , this is just leftover trauma from past relationships , a lot of which she has even told me , that she isn' t used to someone being in love with her or being willing to do anything to make her happy . her rationale for this is that she is afraid of us getting far , and eventually leaving her to find someone younger or more educated . these are things that i' ve told her constantly , i don' t care about , and love her as a person . keep in mind , we' ve had this same convo several times , and a lot of the time , when we have issues , it goes back to this .she goes through moments where she will get really annoyed and irate , lashing out and saying anything , regardless of how hurtful . these are typically very stressful moments where everything builds , and it' s hard to even get through to her during these times . she is very perfectionistic and ocd at normal times , so during this period , that is ramped upfold . despite this , she' s very sensitive and regardless of how mad she gets , reciprocating or even slightly raising my voice is typically met with questions like why are you mad ? or why are you yelling at me ? she always puts up mental barriers when i try to defuse the situation , by pointing out how i nor anyone gets what she is going through , even when i do and have told her circumstances in my life which have mirrored or even trumped her situation . nonetheless , her listening can be pretty sparse when she gets like this so it' s almost impossible to help her . i have gotten moments where i' ve lost my cool as of recently and stormed out to clear my head , and i' ve even told her of this being my way of avoiding saying something that i may regret , but she chastises it as being childish . there' s almost no winning in this situation as when i leave , i ' m blamed for walking out when things get bad , when i stay , i either fight back or have to sit there and take it .she' s very type as she is used to and gets annoyed when she can' t take care of someone else . she isn' t used to having someone do something for her , and with me , i ' m used to working and being the workhorse so when i default to that , she doesn' t know how to take it . she is constantly worried about my parents believing she is using me despite the fact that i' ve told her that i don' t care what they think and neither should she . there are times when she' ll get outright angry that i won' t let her do something for me , even when it' s clear she is worn out . there isn' t much balance here because i also can' t just sit around and appear to be lazy , despite the fact that this is what i aim to avoid as i hate the idea of being the man that comes back from work and does nothing but sits down while the woman does all the work .she goes through the i ' m fat or i ' m old phase quite a lot despite me telling her otherwise and giving more affirmations .( she is actually small and pretty damn hot if i do say so myself . she could pass for . )it gets pretty bad when coupled with the insecurity that i ' m younger and she believes i' ll eventually leave her for someone younger .( i definitely wouldn' t ). that much almost makes her do a whole defensive routine where she is always assuming i ' m looking at someone different or possibly thinking about someone else . because of that , she says that she can' t fully let go or getinvolved because she thinks she' ll get dependent and i' ll be gone . she also works in a workplace that tends to be really messy in terms of people' s interactions with each other , which only bolsters this fear as she seems to internalize what she see' s from guys andor women in her workplace and reflect that onto me . perhaps this is overactive fe at work ?now , one thing that i do have a question for is that she hates it when people do something for her and then throw it in her face that they did it for her , usually in an attempt to get something from her or subjugate her . now i hate this too , so i' d never do it , however , when she does something or claims i don' t really care about her , and i bring up what i' ve done( not in an attempt to get something from her , but to tell her how my actions back up my loyalty to her. )most recently , i used an example to show her how she was doing the same thing to me that someone in her workplace did to her , and apparently that was the last straw as she said that she would never trust me with information ever again . now , i didn' t see this as doing , that , but moreso just using an example that she could relate to as an attempt to build empathy , but apparently it wasn' t taken that way .i ' m at a loss as to what to do because it seems like every night it' s something that will just set her off and create a new argument moment . even the most innocuous things like innocent jokes and asides are perceived as attacks now and i literally feel like i ' m walking on egg shells at any given moment . i default to just being quiet now when the moment gets tense as i don' t want to say anything that' s out of line , but even that has started to annoy her so i ' m again in a loselose here . there are plenty of times where if i simply ask why she' s mad or tell her what she' s doing she' ll default to shutting me out by saying , maybe we should just end it right here so you don' t have to be with someone who iseven when i don' t even come close to implying this .at the end of most of our talks she admits that it' s not even me , but it' s just something wrong with her , and that she needs help because of what she has been through . it' s left her damaged and created an almost ptsd situation for her . she' s even informed me about her mood swings from time to time .( often )she always thanks me for my understanding and the fact that i' ve literally been everything she could ever have wanted and she just can' t believe that i ' m real because it' s so shocking to finally feel loved . she tells me that she' s afraid and doesn' t know how , to be happy yet and for me to work through this with her , yet when she gets angry , all of this goes out the window. . it leaves me confused and puzzled as to what to do . i ' m normally a dick to anyone who wrongs me , but i can' t bring myself to not treat her like a queen . the only thing is , it doesn' t get me very far , but it' s all i can even make myself do . i just don' t know what to do honestly . i ' m not looking to break up with her because for all the issues i' ve listed ,( and there are more. )if i were to talk about the good and the positives in her personality , i' d be talking for days because she literally has that much upside . i ' m just not sure at the moment how much longer we can last with her going through these swings . i want to be with this woman for life , but not this version of her . i can deal with it , but it takes a toll on me , and personally i ' m already a very negative and pessimistic person , but when i ' m with her , that goes away and i ' m just positive and happy . this isn' t to say i ' m dependent on her for happiness as i tend to be more of a loner and am fine by myself , however , the ecstasy of a relationship with someone you genuinely love is seldom and i' d rather not lose that if i could help it . so my question is , is this simply an unhealthy type that will get better , or does this sound like some longterm nonpersonality based issue that may never go away."

infp,"not sure if' ghosting 'is the right term , but i have an type friend who i love a great deal , and recently she' s become very distant she won' t reply to messages , she' ll cancel plans last minute , i won' t hear from her for long periods of time and sometimes i feel like she kind of leaves me hanging , especially emotionally we' ll grow close then suddenly she' ll disappear without explanation . and i ' m wondering if i should take this personally or not ? how can i tell if she' s blanking me because she doesn' t like me anymore or whether she just needs distance and this is her way of dealing with things ? i asked her directly and she apologised and assured me she still cares but that she worries about seeming boring and doesn' t have much to say , which i ' m interpreting as her way of saying she has some heavy issues but doesn' t want or know how to talk about them , because it' s never really been a problem for theyears of knowing her up until now . but what i find really challenging is that , in anybody else , this kind of behaviour i would usually interpret as rude and i can' t tell whether i should feel angry or not . it can be quite confusing and painful to be on the receiving end of being ghosted , so why is it ok for type' s to treat their friends this way , but not for other groups ? it' s hard cause on the one hand , as an type , i can relate a lot !i probably seem very antisocial at times and i really mean no harm or offense , i just find it safer keeping to myself sometimes . but on the other hand , i feel like there are certain ways we ought to treat each other and claiming the rules don' t apply to me because i ' m an type i ' m not sure is a valid excuse . i guess what i really wonder is , what' s happening inside an type when they don' t reply or go mia etc ? is it because they' re wracked with anxiety and heavy emotional loads and replying just feels too wrong and being alone just feels right and they' re aware it' s socially rude and they feel bad but just hope their friends will understand and forgive them ? or is it simply because they just don' t care enough to reply ? they rank their own emotional comfort higher than their social obligations , in which case that is kind of rude and selfish . it' s a really tough question that i find challenging myself as i often feel like it takes a very forgiving and understanding person to be my friend , due to all my faults , and i ' msure i' ll never give up on my type friend and will always assume the best in her because she' s amazing and i love her . but at the same time , being left hanging and ignored really does hurt sometimes and makes me feel small . perhaps a happy medium can be found somewhere."
isfp,"soo a couple years ago when my type friend sent me to take a personality type quiz after i was complaining to her about my job , i found out i was an type . later on , i decided to take the test again , and i got type . then did it again and got type. . this test gave a percentage of each and i think i wasn' t too much more se , but was just by a little . this did make me question myself and who i fit under , but for sure i am a more creative , artsy person so i could say i am definitely type . then the question of intuition has been coming into my mind , especially lately . id say over the past couple years i' ve become more intuitive , thinking of the future , trying to plan and set goals . i also didn' t understand how i could be se dominant if i actually do think i tend to be intuitive . then i came across this article a few weeks ago , which says that ourfunction is extroverted sensing , andis introverted intuition . it then says that we are quite balanced in our se and ni , even through ni is. this was like an aha !moment for me . i more started to question it because i recently also came across the idea of highly sensitive people , and i thought that i was one . i bought a book called the highly sensitive person and started to read it . i just started , but in the first chapter it talks about how hsp are very intuitive people . so i thought to myself , if i am considered se , then how can fit as an intuitive hsp . well now i think its a little more clear to me . i looked quickly into the number of type' s that are considered hsp , and it seems to be a lowcompared to other intuitive personality types . id like to get some insight from my other type' s . do any of you consider yourself to be highly sensitive ? also , do you consider yourself to have a good dose of ni , where it can be balanced with your se ? im new to diving more into personality types and hsp , so any insight would be great . i also just started reading the book so i have no idea what else is in here . i guess i just thought that all types would be like me , highly sensitive lol . this is interesting to me . i am not the number one fan of labels in general , but these have helped me to understand myself better and why things have affected my life."

isfp,"hello types , i ' m here to ask a question on the cognitive functions stacking of your type because i ' m going through a typing crisis . i' ve typed myself as type for a long time , but i' ve started to have doubts mainly because of two functions se and te . as for se , the problem is that my se seems to be nonexistent . i don' t live in the present but rather in my own head , i ' m not really spontaneous and can' t live in the moment , and when i try to do that( which is usually when i ' m drunk , as i find it hard to let myself go otherwise )it ends up being a mess and chaotic more than anything else . the problem with te is that it seems to work better than my se . i ' m not the type of person to plan every little thing , but at the same time i ' m no airhead who can' t get things done . i can indeed be organized and efficient when i need to be( i was described as a war machine on my job , which is in the research field for context ), because as long as i can do things my own way , i have no problem with deadlines and time management and all that stuff . i like to have a general plan for my day just to have a general idea of where i ' m going while still keeping it flexible nor am i extremely emotional to the point of not being able to hold back judgement when i need to , i know when it is the moment to express myself and when i need to shut up . i also don' t really see myself in inferior te problems. . and a fini loop makes no sense because i' ve been like this my whole life and not just for some period of time . the only thing i ' m sure about is that ni and fi and my highest functions and everything else around that makes no sense . do any of you types relate to this , andor have an explanation ? i don' t know if it can help or influence anything , but in enneagram i ' m a w(or)sosx."

enfj,"i ' m pretty sure she' s an type but she could also be an type.it' s hard to tell . i ' m leaning towards type because i have had a few conversations with her and we were in sync a lot.she just reminded me of what i think the type type would be like . but i don' t know her that well personally so i don' t have a lot to go off of . i know for afact she' s an e and an f , and i ' m likesure she' s a j , but i ' m betting she' s not too far off from p . she told me her biggest pet peeve is people' s messes and she loses her mind when things get messy . i' ve also seen her react pretty strongly to certain arguments . both of these pretty much suggest j . however , her base personality is so laid back . she' s charming , she smiles a lot , she' s always happy , always talking to everybody , her social skills are so good that it' s almost intimidating . again she could be a sensor , but i felt like her and i clicked in an n type way instead of the typical disconnect you may get between a sensor and an intuitive . like i said i could be wrong though . anyway.every time she sees me for the first time of the day , she winks at me . literally every day . the first time i spoke to her i mentioned that i wasn' t feeling good and she asked me all these types of questions like what did i eat , what time i went to sleep , how much water i drank , etc.yeah it was insane . but i like that sometimes she touches me lightly on the arm when she' s talking to me , but it could just be a friendly touch i ' m not sure . like i said she' s an extremely friendly person so she may do this to other people too . sometimes she' ll help me with something on the computer and when she does , she leans over me and her face gets really close to mine , and she' ll turn and talk to me from this distance . if i ask her to help me out with something , she' ll do the whole thing for me and walk me through each step . today at work i was on the computer and i was talking to a few co workers in a casual setting( they were standing )and she came over and sat on my desk and started talking to the group as a whole . sometimes her and i will debate about psychology and we go really in depth with it . not sure how important this is but i added it . in any ordinary situation i would be thinking that she definitely likes me , but because she' s so friendly to everybody and open , i ' m afraid that she might just have a flirtatious personality and i ' m reading it all wrong . maybe she' s just a touchyfeely kind of person who winks in a friendly way and isn' t bothered by personal space and whatnot . i keep giving myself excuses about it because i feel like the fact that i like her is making my mind over interpret every little thing she does . anyway , put yourself in her shoes as far as i' ve described and let me know what you think . whether she' s type or type i don' t think it would be much different."

esfj,"a wonderful afternoon to all my type pals , and other rando types . i have a behavior in my type that is manifesting in strange ways as of late . the behavior itself is quite typical for my type yet the items on which that behavior is being applied to are , in my opinion , well.insignificant. . borderline just outright dumb . at the very least nonsensical . lets get neurotic . my wife' s neuroticism has served us very well through our life . we have had many a trial and tribulation that has been a lot smoother due to this . it took me years to get it . to understand the value of it . but i did eventually see the benefit to that behavior . it helped us a ton during the building years , with our kids , finances .the list goes on. . i understand that is how my wife exist . i like it . moving through time here . we are now living under complete control essentially . our life is so fine tuned . there are no major worries . there are no on going issues . there are no financial woes . our boys are adults and doing as well as they can be in their stations . we are , for the first time in over years here ? stable in so far as goods and services are concerned . we are also stable in our love and respect for one another . although that is always something that can grow . i shall not rest on my laurels with that one . so where i find that we have a substantially truncated life in so far as drama goes ? my type still displays the same neurotic extremes on items yet the items are , to my mind , trivial . a quick example. . the other day we were out and about and she misplaced her debit card between stores . not a big deal really . we always have cashcredit andor other debit cards from other accounts . well this turned into a fiasco . where asyears ago items like this where mere annoyances . so is this a surprise to me ? well no , not exactly . about the time our boys hit mid teens i could see the writing on the wall and tried to push her into making more friends andor trying new hobbies . yet she swears that she has enough to do . she is okay in so far as extra stuff . she also says she is happy that we are so stable and what not . i mean i cant disagree . things are great !too great !i do believe there in lies the problem . so type . if you were to properly assess this situation in yourself i am left with what i believe to be two options . one insert something to be worried about . not something that could hurt us of course but something that can get her attention that she cares for and needs to be maintained with demands on her that require her solutions . two somehow truncate her concern and open her up to seeing that this is how our new life is going to be . it is what she was aiming for and now we are here . i do not think optionwill work . i do not think she has it in her to just chill . a quick point . i have indeed , over the lastyears , been trying to implement the above two options but not to the point of force . i just suggest and try to point out the obvious benefits . i am willing to get more adamant . i am just not sure if trying to force the issue is the right thing here . hmmmm don' t know really . could use some guidance at this point . appreciate the help and words to any that may answer."

intp,"i think i came up with a new theory today . today i read about the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in the human brain . the cortex fulfills all the specific functions that an ntype has as characteristics . this means it could be responsible for the properties of an type . for example , the dorsolateral cortex is responsible for abstract , deductive , syllogistic thinking and also working memory , which is usually well developed in intuitive people . it helps to make decisions in an egalitarian way . he is responsible for ntypes not being able to tell lies . the cortex uses dopamine in particular . because the prefrontal cortex is normally inactive during sleep , an overactive one can result in a licid dream . it helps to quickly switch attention when an abstract goal changes . it is related to intelligence and is responsible for good spatial and visual memory . he is responsible for making just and moral decisions and he is responsible for anxiety and overthinking in social situations as well . this could have an interesting application if the dorsolateral cortex is particularly active in types , that means it has a larger volume and can be seen on an mri if it' s high resolution . or in an eeg you can see if the region is more active . that' s why you can find out concretely with an examination how pronounced your intuition is . der sitz des metabewusstseins im gehirn"

esfj,"currently i' ve known this type girl for about four years during college and i ' m not sure about our dynamic and i wanted to see the perspective of an outsider on the matter . generally i' ve been pretty platonic around her for the first three years since i was interested in a different girl and never really thought of her in that certain manner . the type does know about the different girl since the first time i met her which lasted to around the start of fourth year . in the third year i was going through a nifi loop and i reached out to the type for some advice on how to get through it . sometime during the third year we were both drunk at a party and she took the initiative in trying to make out with me but at the time i didn' t have any feelings for her so i pushed her back . i didn' t really think much about the matter after that and i don' t believe it strained our relationship . in our fourth year at another party we ended up kissing and she was really vocally ecstatic about it much to my surprise . after awhile i start thinking about the kiss and why i ended up kissing her as it isn' t something i would normally do even if i was intoxicated . in some of our earlier drunk experiences we would often be near each other and she would be really physical with me like holding hands or touching my shoulders but i didn' t pay it too much attention since we were drunk . at the current time i believe i do have feelings for her but at the same time i have some hesitation since she is so different from me which is good as i can improve myself with qualities that she has that i lack but perhaps the differences can be too big. .( e vs i and n vs s )in the long term i ' m not sure if i can keep up with her as she really likes to go out and hang with big crowds as well as being unintentionally flirty and the differences in our interests and how we communicate are certainly different which might lead us to find each other boringmisunderstandings . our conversations are decent as we talk about personal matters as well as deep things such as her fears and personal information revolving around her family conflicts . i didn' t realize that i might have feelings until somewhat recently( aboutmonths ago )and been trying to debate with myself whether i should pursue it . i don' t fear rejection but i do fear that i might inadvertently hurt her as she has been in two bad relationships so far and i value her as a friendconfidant . it makes me feel uneasy as she has seen me in a weak and vulnerable state during my nifi loop . i can' t tell if she likes me since she is very friendly with a lot of people and things that went beyond being platonic were done when we were drunk . first year hand drawn her a picture by her request which she later surprised me with a hand drawn picture of her own plastered on my door the next morning( years later she brings up the picture )a lot of my friends would often come to my room for late night talks and in one of these excursions she really wanted to give me a back rub despite out of everyone i had the lowest amount of desire for one( she did succeed in giving one )had a closely knit group ofpeople including myself which she even gave the nickname for and frequently wanted to face time( type , type , type and type )greets me with a lot of physical contact which at the time i didn' t really take all that well didn' t really have a good impression of her since she was all super touchy and this reminded me of some people i didn' t end with well in high school but i didn' t let this affect our friendship( it was at the back of my mind though )second year she dated one of the people( type )in the group and the group collapsed but we were still friendly with each other mostly her or the type would organize events to do things together type and her start fighting and they end up having a bad break up( she ended up very hurt )third year she starts dating a different guy who later doesn' t feel as emotionally invested in the relationship as her and they break up went to seek emotional advice from the type due to nifi loop about a girl i was interested in and we bonded over the fears we had , emotional vulnerability and other personal matters a mutual friend asks her out but gets rejected( possibly due to bad timing and had liked her since first year )she tries to make out with me while drunk but i stopped it from going further fourth year got over my nifi loop and the relationship ended with the different girl ended up kissing her while drunk and she had a mini celebration about it start pondering why i kissed her and reevaluate her as a potential interest( as my first impression wasn' t correct )she would often invite me to parties or clubs and would ask me if i had fun going to them the next day one of these parties i ended up talking to some random girl and she was really awkward around us( somewhat strange since she is normally very socially adept ) "

infj,"i just finished reading the alchemist and it was inspiring . i highly recommend it . the story is all about personal transformation and having the courage to realize our dreams . i like the idea that we come into this world with an imprint of what we would like to accomplish , as if our interests and tastes from there on out are clues to the larger puzzle . my only gripe about the book was the emphasis on finding yourself rather than on creating yourself( i think it' s a combination of both )and the insinuation that journeys are best done through extraversion as opposed to introversion( but dorothy and alice !)naturally , i guess , since i ' m an introverted planner and i value imagination highly . personally , writing has been a constant in my life . my mom told me a story last night about how i used to make picture books for my friends and family when i was about three . apparently i' d frantically draw and then throw the pages over my shoulder as i went , like i couldn' t get my thoughts out fast enough . she said i' d then go back and collect and order them carefully , remembering how they all fit together . it' s funny how your three year old self can serve as an inspirational character in your future i was also transfixed with the story of snow white at that age . recently i found a great piece about how jung was interested in the fairy tale as a metaphor for the female individuation process . i' ve been really into jung and the individuation process over the past few years , so maybe there is something to this idea that we intuitively have a sense of purpose very young that we have to later realize ? i thought that it would be fun to ask my fellow nf' s about their dreams and goalsalthough anyone feel free to jump in !. )is there something that you' ve always wanted to do or have been interested in ? broadly , specifically , a journey , creation , vocation , etc ? . )how did this show up in your childhood ? . )has anythingone served as an impetus in helping you to get started ? blessings in disguise , synchronicity , motivation , bizarre occurrences , revelations , etc ? . )what steps have you taken along your path ? he still had some doubts about the decision he had made . but he was able to understand one thing making a decision was only the beginning of things . when someone makes a decision , he is really diving into a strong current that will carry him to places he had never dreamed of when he first made the decision .paulo coelho , the alchemist . )doubts . nagging , pesky doubts . do you have them ? we' re all stories in the end . just make it a good one , eh?"
intp,"she gets a lot of recognition for both her math and art skills ? both are things i don?t think she can do without when she goes to college . she is also good at coding and language arts and sociology . i saw her watching a harvard group discuss hyperbolic geometry the other day on youtube and i wondered if maybe she had found a way to combine art and math . do you guys have any other ideas for her that if you were her that you would want to hear about ? also , any ideas on summer jobs for a teenage type girl . she hasn?t been diagnosed with autism because she tests out , but there is some difficulty or reluctance with socialization there and she gets overstimulated and freezes easily . i think maybe she could do anything with art and math ? even if it requires some social skills like tutoring . i?ve seen her try to be very patient and i think if motivated she could find ways to explain math or art to others . your feedback is appreciated . also i?d love to hear about what you guys were like at her age compared to what i?m saying here."
istj," ( burner account so that this person doesnt recognise me )i( type female )was in a relationship with an type male for the last half year . we were instantly very attracted to each other and started seeing each other very often . i didn' t understand his personality type at the start , so initially we had a lot of little clashes about him not being affectionate enough because i thought he just didn' t like me . eventually i understood and grew to really like his reserved nature and he became very comfortable with me to the point where hes usually not even quiet around me now . we spent the last few months of the relationship having an on and off argument about him moving in with a female friend who i hadnt met before . he was very awkward about us meeting because he didnt see the problem with it and he didnt understand my anxieties about it so it was all communicated very badly . eventually we had a big break up where i cried and left because i just felt too uncomfortable with the living situation . however i did want us to resolve it and it was just a lot of emotion hitting me . he got very upset too and said he can' t keep arguing and being on and off all the time and said he doesnt want to be together as a couple again . as he' s never had a girlfriend before he didnt know how to deal with the break up , and as i wanted him back i spoke to his friend and showed him i can be comfortable with her , and then i spent the last month still seeing him and basically acting like his girlfriend but he kept insisting he didnt want to be in a relationship and was trying to treat it as a casual thing . we were extremely happy all month but he kept insisting that we cant be a couple and it just made me very frustrated after i put in so much effort to make up with his friend . long story short , i told him he should cut me off properly instead of stringing me along if he doesnt want a relationship anymore , so we completely cut each other off and didnt meet forweeks . we didnt text for a few days and he was very upset and not leaving the house etc . i asked him to meet as friends afterweeks because i missed him and he agreed , and it ended up in us having sex . after we did it , he kept saying he didnt want to do that and that it' s messing with his head and stopping him from moving on . he was very firm with me and just said outright he doesnt want to see me again and cant keep being nice to me because he just spent the last week grieving the relationship thinking it was the last time . he also said he doesnt agree with casual sex at all and that it feels wrong when it' s someone you care about . i ' m not one to cling to relationships at all but this is my first time dating an type and i just find his response so confusing . i know and can tell he clearly has very strong feelings for me , he told me that he loves me and i' ve seen how upset he gets whenever we' ve had a break up , and he even said we cant meet anymore even as friends because hes trying to block me out . i don' t understand why he' s fighting his emotions so much . he said hes sure we' re going to end up arguing over something else again even if we do get back together and that he doesnt want the drama and exhaustion anymore , even though i told him the main issue was the female flat mate but i spoke to her and resolved the tensions that were there . it' s really difficult for me to just cut him off or forget him when i know he loves me and has strong feelings for me but he' s fighting it for no reason . i know the trust is gone because we did have small break ups and then got back together trying temporary solutions like avoiding her etc before i actually spoke to her and resolved it properly , so he thinks we' re just going to break up again if we get back together . that' s why he' s trying to fight it and he wants to be logical and thinks we arent compatible because of those arguments . i' ve tried to reiterate to him that all of the arguments were about that one issue and when we' re together we are very happy . what should i do at this point ? i want him back but i feel like i' ve been stressing him out these last few weeks with the casual sex etc because it' s giving him conflicting emotions about breaking up with me , but at the same time he' s wanted to do it just as much as i have and i don' t understand why he' s fighting his emotions so much just for the sake of being logical . just looking for advice and general thoughts on the situation . he doesn' t get angry often and i feel he' s starting to get very irritable at me about this situation and it makes me feel like he hates me . i know he does love me but he' s feeling annoyed and stressed at how we' re going about this break up because us meeting up obviously means he has to actively try not to hold my hand or kiss me etc and he said he thinks i ' m manipulating him with the sex , but every time we' ve met as friends it' s happened completely naturally and he' s wanted it too . it was just this time after we wentweeks apart and he had a week or two to grieve on his own , we had sex but he regretted it straight after and said it was wrong . i just need some help understanding what to do from here . i ' m worried that if i do just go no contact and give him space he' s going to forget about me and get over the grieving period and there wont be any chance to reconcile because his emotions wont be as strong anymore . thank you in advance for reading"
istj,"there is this guy that we both had a liking towards each other aboutyears ago , things went downhill because he was not ready for commitment and other complicationshowever i have always been in love with him . i saw him with a bunch of friends at a bar last week and being the tipsy confident me i went up to him and said hello . i went too shake hands with him and he was so nervous i think because he shook my hand very soft and gently . he said he did not recognise me but looked really glad to see me and said that he remembers me backyears ago , we continued to chat , he cracked some humour here and there( also laughed at my jokes too ). i also noticed he spoke quite deep and loudly , smiled a lot , his eyes were lit upall big and was looking directly at my face when i was talking to him . after aboutmins we had to part ways and when i said goodbye i put out my hand to shake hands he grabbed my hand and he shook very soft and gentle . then i texted him straight afterwards and told him that it was nice to see him and to have a nice evening he messaged me back saying nice to see you too( he' s always been a robotic text messager , dry and straight to the point mind you ). do you reckon he would still possibly be interestedi want to ask him if he wants to catch up for drinks some time in the future."
estj,"my dad , i have no doubt , is an type , and as long as i can remember , we' ve had a terrible relationship , from my point of view anyway . as a child , he would scream at me and go into an absolute rage over sins as terrible as accidentally stepping on his foot , swinging on a cabinet door , or , heaven forbid , spilling a glass of water . he couldn' t understand , for instance , why i wouldn' t want to go out on halloween with a sweater over my costume because it was breezy , why i wouldn' t want to ride hisyearold bike instead of asking him to spendon a new one , or why i didn' t want to wear those ugly track pants that were about four sizes too small for me to school . school was , and is , an absolute bloody nightmare . he wanted me to do everything absolutely perfectly and go beyond what was expected even on the most pointless little' busy work 'sheets , and would hover over me while i did my homework , and then , as with everything else , flip out when i made the tiniest of mistakes or my printing wasn' t neat enough for him . and don' t get me started on his reluctance to spend money . the vacations we took were always a horrible ordeal . we would camp in a tent in a trailer park , eating like we were on welfare , then get up and drive , drive , drive all day , stopping for an hour at the most at the places we saw , while he would find anything about me or my brother and sister to insult , throw tantrums at having to spend more than two dollars a day on food , and just generally making me wish we were at home and he was at work . and yet , somehow , he recalls these vacations as being great experiences . he drove a city bus for twentyfive years and hated his job , and would come home and take all his frustration out on me and my brother and sister . i realize i ' m all over the place here , but you should get the idea . i just can' t understand him . he' s obsessively punctual , i ' m extremely laid back . someone' s five minutes late ? meh . i literally don' t even notice it . he goes crazy . for him , everything has to be planned out , and he schedules absolutely everything . i avoid planning and scheduling like the plague . i could live with this if , of course , he didn' t feel the need to run my life in the same way . i ' m twenty one years old and he treats me like i ' m a little kid and can' t be trusted to make my own choices . when he goes on about me needing to be more responsible , to me , it seems that all he wants is for me to be responsible enough to do exactly what he tells me to , when he wants me to do it . the guy has a stranglehold on my life and i can' t escape . he always wonders why i don' t tell him anything , well , it' s because anything i tell him he files away in that mind of his and uses it against me , either to increase his control over me and my life , or to take juvenile little pot shots at me . if i say yes to something , then i absolutely can' t get out of it . to him , that means it' s set in stone . more than anything , i absolutely can' t stand that . i need to be flexible , and i need to be able to do what i want with my time . the worst is when , for example , he' ll wake me up atin the morning because he wants me to clean out his car , he' ll jokingly say things like , hey , i ' m being really mean , huh , which , to me , says that he understands fully that he' s making me miserable , he knows he' s broken down any selfesteem i might have had at one time to the point where i won' t fight back , and he doesn' t care . i ' m twentyone years old , male , and taller and more physically fit than he is , but i ' m terrified of my dad , and always have been . i don' t tell him the truth when i make a mistake , because it just makes things worse , and i don' t say no to him because to him that word , coming from me , has no meaning , because he just finds ways to get me to do what he wants anyway . the reason i ' m posting this now is because three years ago , my parents got a divorce( i honestly can' t remember a time in my life when they did get along ), and i made the unfortunate mistake of moving in with my dad . the way he got me to do it was true to form very , very manipulatively . i won' t go into detail , but the point is , things have gotten progressively and progressively worse , and i ' m going crazy living with this guy . i need to get away from him so i can finally start to rebuild my life , but i really don' t want to hurt his feelings too badly . ergo , my question is , how can i tell him i want to move out without the guy either flipping out on me or getting all depressed and crying( he does this )? i really , really can' t understand types , and so if anyone could give me advice , i would be quite grateful."
entp,"how do types use ti ? how do you build your ti frameworks ? what is the process , where do you find the pieces to the things you put together ? how do you define things , how do you fill your categories and put the pieces together to build the logical understands you have ? how do you us this in argumentation ? if you were to take out ne from the picture , what is left in terms of ti ? please go into detail about this and give some examples , thank you !

istp,"types , i need your help figuring out what happened with an type i dated recently . as for my type , i ' m likely one of the nf variety . so i met this type online , we chatted for about two weeks before we met in person . he seemed really interested to the point where it made me a little disinterested( ha gotta love polarity )and our first date went pretty well , though i was unsure . he kept in touch all week , calling every day , and made plans to hang out the next weekend as our first date ended . i was honest about my past relationship( messy )because i figured why not , but he still seemed to be interested so i was like?? alright interesting . the whole time from initial email to the second date i wasmyself , sarcastic which he seemed to enjoy , opinionated , honest , etc . so . in between the second date i started to realize i liked him more and more . this made me nervous and when i get nervous i just talk , sometimes not even sure what i am saying because i ' m stuck in my head and don' t act like myself etc . probably came across as needy , basically no bueno . but . tried to keep it together . soooo he literally drove two hours last weekend to my apartment so we could hang out for a few hours . i was like okay he seems interested this makes me nervous but in a good way . he gets to my apartment , and tbh , it' s the nicest place i' ve ever lived and will probably ever live . i moved to the area for a job that didn' t work out , and the area is expensive so i will probably be leaving in a few months . that said the first thing he says when he lets me know he' s at my apt is you have expensive taste !this is really nice !uh oh . he made several comments about this throughout the night and seemed super distant . which of course made me nervous and say stupid things because i felt guilty he drove all the way over just to be bored or whatever . the next day we texted a bit , but i felt like he was over it . i told him hey tbh i ' m sort of nervous about dating again so i feel like i wasn' t myself . to which he replied honestly i just feel a friend vibe and i don' t see that going any further?? he said you' re beautiful and sweet and did everything right but i just have an inner feeling this won' t work out . which pissed me off haha so i figured ok well while this went to hell i might as well ask for feedback . so i said okay what happened that made you feel the friend vibe ? i' d rather know than repeat my mistakes . he said nothing you did wrong i just didn' t see it working out . so i didn' t text him until a few days later saying sorry i grilled you , and hey i thought about it and you' re right that we' d be better friends so keep in touch if you like( i honestly felt that way at the time but i ' m a woman and once i said it i realized that i don' t want to just be friends ). to which he replied sounds gooduhhh how did he lose pretty obvious interest in record timing ? !? !so it' s been almost a week since we talked and i ' m overthinking everything every day . i don' t get what happened ? did he assume i ' m a spoiled brat from my apartment ? did i smell bad ? is there someone else ? am i too emotional ? wtf? ? it' s driving me crazy . i figure if i want to keep any semblance of hope i have to treat him like a cat and let him be free and come to me if he changes his mind . but part of me also wants to call him out . he said his longest relationship wasmonths . we' re both almostand i want to be like dude if you ever hope to get married( he mentioned wanting to start his own family )you can' t run away at the first sign of conflict ? you have to learn how to communicate and not assume shit . that' s not what i ' m going to do but i so want to . is my analysis of what happened in line with type behavior ? i don' t think i know any others haha . i just need to figure it out because i already suck at dating and i think this will affect me in the future . plus you types are so dang attractive , i ' m sure i' ll fall for another one? and i' ll be honest that i still like him and am holding on to stupid hope even though i know it' s stupid . can anyone help a sista out ?

istj,"hi , i ' m an type , but lately because an overwhelming amount of work ( hours daily ), a demanding relationship hanging by a tread , and fixing my crumbling house and living situation , i have been pushed into the deepest cavity in my life . to support all these things , i subconsciously gave up my enjoyable carefree spirit . first i felt depressed , then i know i can' t give up supporting myself and the people i love , so i tirelessly did what i can . when i caught a break i ' m constantly talking to myself as to what to do now and next , and calculate my timing to see if my plan is possible . i find myself locked onto a specific task and abandoning bonding time . then i later realized that i' ve been stuck in this tunnel staring out for a while and i hear my girlfriend said i am not very imaginative , my mom said i am very cruel( i cursed all the homeless villages that surrounds my neighborhood , and anybody who drives very slowly ), my sister distance herself from me saying i ' m selfish . i lose my temper easily , i take bigger risks and work harder if that means improving my efficiency and meeting deadlines on any task on the job or at home . i am frustrated when i am met with demands and given no practical support or unrealistic time frame . i shy myself away from people fearing that they might give me more demands . took a test recently and found myself aligning with type . i ain' t got the time to dream right now , but once in a while i do wonder if i will ever return to old self before reaching the end of the tunnel . i fear that i might eventually go insane and losing progress to everything i worked so hard for."

entp,"type descriptions frequently have buzz words like innovative , bold , creative and while these things may be technically true in a manner of speaking( probably coined by an type marketing their garbage self as a desired asset )i doubt that i ' m the only one who' s innovative , bold and creative solutions lead to my mom describing me as ah yes , why buy something at the store forwhen you can figure out how to make a worse version yourself for only . . my innovations have included such wonders as a homemade flash light lamp ducktaped together instead of just changing the lightbulb until my housemate wondered why i was living this way and changed it for me , or the moment today when i thought , hmmm pooping would be a lot better if i had a black board to draw on during and that lead to this monstrosity yes , that' s chalkboard paint . now i can doodle while my body moves dookies. . anyway , post your shitty innovations."
esfj,"hey everyone , i just recently made an account after a year of browsing through perc threads . i felt like i should contribute back as much information that i myself have received from all of the forums . it is a little intimidating being an type and posting in the forums as we don' t have the best reputations online( don' t really have that same reputation irl from people who know me though ). i find that i operate on a need to basis for the most part . i like to feel needed and helpful . i' ve noticed that when someone uses that phrase in conjunction with a request , my inner hero switch is activated and i have found a cause to devote my energy to . this only applies to people that i care about though i ' m not too much invested in the lives of unfamiliar people unless i find grounds for mutual understanding . i am motherish which is what my younger brothers have told me but i mean , what' s wrong with mothers? kitteh i don' t actively dislike confrontations , conflict or leadership positions . if there is a reason to have a confrontation or take on a leadership role( because there isn' t a suitable candidate or someone whom i care about has asked me to )then i engage in it . every since i was young , i have been somewhat of a workaholic be it at school( being student union vp and p , full ib , specialization degree )or even when i worked during a gap year withjobs . i do dislike insincerity , laziness , and lying . i think that this is because all three of those said qualities interfere with my ability to trust a person and therefore have a relationship with them . if you' re insincere( pretending to dosay something for the sake of doingsaying it )then i know that i cannot rely that you will say or do something when the time comes up . if you' re lazy( and not like i don' t want to get out of bed but there is something that should be done affecting others and you don' t do it )then again , i can' t rely that you are able to take care of duties or handle responsibilities . if you' re lying( intentionally deceiving someone for personal gain )then i cannot communicate with you as i do not trust what you say . i likerequire these qualities in friends honesty , loyalty and a hardworking attitude . this is why i enjoy my friendships with other healthy sentinels a lot because we get stuff done when stuff needs to get done . and like me , we like having plans and sticking to those plans( i personally have the next decade of my life planned out almost to a t ). yes i can try a new way to do something but why take that chance when i know that the old , testedtrue way will give me the results that i expect . minimize risks and optimize your benefits . i don' t know why people find it so hard to connect sensory and intuitive types . it' s not that one is better than the other , or that sensory types are stupid . we just have different ways of interacting with the world . i' ve not had issues with types , types , types , types or types in my life whom i share common views with . any comments on your thoughtprocesses or similardissimilar experiences? happy"
estp,"i was wondering if anyone has experiences of types being shy and quiet types ? i ask because i?m considering type for my own type because in the past ive been exceedingly talkative , confrontational , center of attention etc , but i?m also very very shy and barely speak unless i?m in the company of someone i know well( and even then i can be mute )i also like my space and alone time and am quite comfortable being alone . i am also a highly empathetic person who never wishes to hurt anyones feelings , so i?m tactful , something types aren?t known for . so , have you experienced a shy type ? maybe with social anxiety or merely avowing a silence that is more comfortable to them than being boisterous and completely extroverted?"
intj,"hello all , i have ventured into your rational domain with a query that will require knowledge of your irrational , internal , fiercely guarded fi . advance apologiesi can already hear the fuses blowing on your circuit boards . two years ago i met an type female . the attraction was intense and immediate . i ask you trust my intuition when i say that i knew our colliding in the near or distant future was inevitable . it was stronger than a magnetic pull( duel ni dom perhaps ? )and i have only felt such immediate attraction with an exgirlfriend( an type ). in the months that followed we' d meet in happy' coincidence 'she' d show up at my stomping grounds and we' d steal minutes and hours in group settings getting to know each other . wide eyed stares( i mean , unashamed staringcontinuing even after i' ve met her gaze with a coy smile ), boasting of intellect and hushed tones when i' ve seen through her walls( which i know have been built very high ). i believe i understand her and that i have a solid read on her person but have myself been reticent in making my interest' obvious 'so as to see if her interest was genuine( foolish , i know ). i have a suspicion we spent this time trying to figure out where the other person stood and with classic introvert hesitancy , neither of us made a move . life has happened for us both and we haven' t seen each other in a couple of months with the likelihood of seeing the other again only happening in a group setting . what i am asking you all( and i acknowledge there is no universal answereveryone is unique etc. ) how do you process liking someone over the long term( maybe i ' m asking if your crushes are long termhow rare it is for you to genuinely like someone )? as in , as an type , is it likely her interest is still there ? admittedly , it is for me . crushes , hell , being genuinely drawn to anyone at all , is a very rare thing for me( we' re both in our late twenties )and i hope that in understanding your psychologyhow you work i can decide on my next steps . i' d be truly grateful for any insight you may have !

infp,"initially he said he respected my decision . he still wanted to stay friends . things started going for a rather dark turn when he realized i was unfollowing him on my socials and only( at first )blocked him on facebook . he text me asking why i blocked . i didn?t reply back at first because why should it matter if we?re broken up and i need time to myself and if you?re going to post on your socials things related to our breakup i?d rather not see it . he text me on an evening , i did eventually text back saying that , ?we broke up which calls for space and distance . also you need to talk about this to your therapist before we have any conversations? ? saying this cause i was thinking if you respected me before why is it seeming that you?re all of a sudden offended , if you?re having problems comprehending you should talk to to it therapist for more understanding i was his first relationship . later on after talking to some of my close friends , i was crying, lost , hurt and baffled at how he came to the conclusion that the reason why i broke up with him was because ?i cheated? ? mind you he text both my siblings( i?ve never given him their numbers )asking who the other guy was . it has taken me a whole week to come to terms that i may have just dodged a bullet with this relationship . to me i?m not sure if i?m expressing this the correct way . he text me a week and a half ago asking if we could so he could have clarity . i was and still am confused cause i thought i had already given him that . but since the most recent incident has happened i?m not sure i want to even be around him . the whole situation has made me feel unsafe and uncomfy all at the same time . i just want to understand why an type would go this far to hurt someone he always said he loved . this doesn?t sound like love to me."
estp,"i was just thinking about a couple of experiences i' ve had with a couple of people that i ' m at least convinced are type one male one female , of two different generations . they both let themselves be led by someone they were attracted to , and took whatever they said at face value . it seems to be a pattern with them , except sometimes , it sets them up for heartbreak . i ' m open to the idea that maybe it' s not a type thing , that maybe it' s just the unique circumstances of these two individuals , which leads to the questionhave you ever opened your heart to someone or trusted someone before you really got to know them , and ended up getting hurt as a result?"
enfp,"for example , my type classmate told me she wanted a boyfriend that takes care of her and stands up for her when she' s being verbally attacked and make her feel safe , because the man is supposed to protect their woman and family and that' s how it' s always been . she wants the feeling of protection from him . what are your thoughts on traditionaloldschool values like this?"

estp,"had a great time talking to an type friend last night , he even gave me his number . however , we' ve known each other for a few years and he' s asked me out on a date three times . i said no three times . none of these attempts happened in the same year . i just want to know , by not texting him right away , am i encouraging this chase ? i don' t consider myself very good at reading people , but i think he enjoys the chase . for more background , we primarily communicate through social media and i refrain from texting or calling him excessively . in general , i don' t text many people aside from a few close friends every now and then because i prefer inperson conversations . also , i am not sure how i feel about him . he' s hilarious , charismatic , and we have many common interests , but i can' t come to a conclusion yet . to be honest , my studies take up most of my brain space . is this chase something that interests you guys ? and to follow up , what would happen if i didn' t text him at all ? does this stop the chase in its tracks , or make it even longer ? thanks"
istp,"so i go on this website once in a while to try to understand myself better . but i have a dilemma so i created an account to get some insight . lately i?ve been feeling like i?m in that tini loop thing , and i?m having such a hard time getting out of it . i feel like i don?t know how to live in the present moment anymore . i used to find sensory activities very fun , like cycling , skydiving , swimming , etc but now i can?t even get out of bed . is this some sort of depression ? today i just lied in bed for about two hours , not even distracting myself with anything except my thoughts . i don?t find anything enjoyable . i try my best to get over myself . i list all my privileges and how i don?t deserve to be so lazy , but this selftalk seems to make me feel even more guilt . my question is can any of you types relate ? and how did you solve this problem ? is this even related to mbti at all?"
enfj,"please add if you know any examples . i' ll start with not quite type' s . when i was a kid , i loved the the' s xmen cartoon and it had a great example of an type charles xavier . now , most see him as an type which is probably true because he definitely doesn' t give off that high energy of type' s but the only problem is , no type would actually take that kind of relentless initiative for their cause unless they' ve been put into the position already without any personal effort needing to be carried out . they just do it in their heads and if it comes up naturally and it doesn' t take too much extraneous effort , they' ll fight for what they believe in . type' s on the other hand force what they know is good upon others and this is a good thing cos its force through kindness and empathy . but then i guess you can say what about martin luther king or hitler i make it sound like type' s are lazy but its not the case , they just have a different mode of being . but to really critique an type properly , you just have to mirror them to type' s . type' s despite being introverted have unlimited will and energy and summoning knowingness from other dimensions and wanting to integrate and manifest those things in actuality . the stereotype that type' s are lazy comes from the very real phenomena of type' s being overwhelmed by a flawed te set up of society that makes them feel impossible for them to achieve and actualise or even be able to survive the world they are in . then overthinking comes through the se in the world which stimulates their se and just constantly thinking about se to the point it becomes debilitating . type' s choose to be lazy . se is an immediate function , so to affect it takes no effort yet type' s still don' t bother trying while te takes generations to change in society because te is codified law and mode of being in society . picard from st next gen is also seen as an type but i see his character as an amalgamation of type and type . when he' s being unhealthy and unlikeable , he' s written as an type , but in flow , the te starts to sound like fe . in the new show , he is fully an xnfj . but its a terrible show."
esfj," ( i apologize in advance for the length of this lol )normally i don' t fall for guys. . i might date here and there , but it' s nearly impossible for me to actually be drawn to someone . then i meet this type dude at the bar , through mutual friends . immediately i was enamored with him . i knew right away that we are very fundamentally different( his house is clean , i ' m a slob i am blunt , he is not , etc ), but i could not( cannot )talk myself out of my interest in him . for our first date he invited me to a friends bbq , which struck me odd since i am very slow to let someone in to my inner circle , but i went . it was great . we spent the whole weekend together . also got intimate . i was leary about getting intimate too soon , not because i have slutshaming ideologies( i totally don' t ), but i liked this guy so much that i didn' t want to mess stuff up right off the bat . the next weekend he invites my son and i to a bbq at his parents house , which i declined because i am in no way ready for any of that . we hang out a few more weekends , mostly with his friends or at his place , and things seemed great . like perfect . then one night i tell him i have to meet my bff at the bar because she has something she needs to talk to me about . he was out with his bff , and he said to catch up with him later , we could do something . five minutes after my friend and i get to the bar( not a bar type or his friends ever go to ), my type' s friend , that he had just been hanging out with , shows up , acts shocked to see us there( it was fake shock ), so my friend and i had to scrap the girl talk night since this dude showed up . type came up an hour later , his friend , who had been sitting in the booth next to me , hopped up and let type sit there , everything seemed fine , but then type became super standoffish to me . i was shocked . for one , i was shocked that his friend showed up in the first place( checking on me ? socially oblivious? ? ), and for two , type has always been super attentive , but then suddenly he acts like he barely knows me . i eventually ask him what' s going on , he has no explanation , then , feeling insecure , i get in to the what are you looking for with me ? conversation , and he plainly says he' s just looking to have fun . i plainly say i am not interested in something casual because i have legitimate interest in him , and i can' t do it . we agree to be friends . a few days later i asked him if he wanted to go out with my friends and i , and we fall right back in to seeming like a couple . the next night i asked him if he wanted to go out to a bonfire with me , but he was already out with his friends , so he declined . an hour after i get to this bonfire he texted and asked for the address . i ignored the text because. . idk why. . i just did . there were a lot of people there , i was having a good time , and i thought maybe it' s best if i detract myself a bit from type . however , an hour later , type and his friend show up . he told me that he had heard through the grapevine where the bonfire was , and since i didn' t see his text , they just came out .? honestly i ' m not at all offended by either of those things him popping in to the bar or him randomly showing up at the bonfire , but all of this indicates actual interest . in my head , anyway . at this point it' s beenweeks since the i am not looking for a relationship comment . last night a girl he' s friends with( who isn' t the nicest person )told me that she heard how he explained that he' s not looking for a relationship and , don' t get led on. . he' s really not looking for a relationship . this infuriated him . he was so livid mad . however , when i pressed him on it , why are you mad that she just told me what you had already told me ? , he didn' t back out of it. . i was expecting a well at one point i felt that way but now i dont , but instead he held firm in the fact he isn' t looking for a relationship right now . then when i get up to leave( because come on , at this point i feel like a huge idiot for ignoring that comment in the first place , and carrying on like it had never been said ), he ends up walking me to my car and telling me that he' s a loser , and naming off all the things about himself that make him bad or undesirable , and how he just can' t do that to me , he has to keep himself in check . which to me seems. .? really ? i don' t get it . it seems like a blowoff excuse . then he continues on about how he can' t help that he really likes having me in his life , i say don' t worry , we can still be friends( and i ' m sincere , i would have no problem with this ), and he goes on further about how we have an intellectual connection , we get along great , etc. . and i repeat the whole that' s cool , we will still hang out , the only difference is that we' re not having sex anymore , it' s no big deal . since then we' ve been arguing about this for hours via text( we' re classy like that apparently ). so my question is( sorry that was super tldr )is this simply the cliche scenario where the dude really is just looking for a good time and the chick is all oooh i think he' s just confuuuused , he' ll come around soon , or( as i hope )is it that he really is interested but just digging his heels in( fear of commitment or whatnot )? ultimately i ' m trying to decide if i should ride this out and see where it goes , or if it really isn' t going to go anywhere and i ' m being a chump to think otherwise?"

enfp,its mainly about being a ne dom but i wanted to ask especially types because i want to see if i could be type soo can a type be sure of what they want in life ? and can they be specific about it ? i ask because ne is seen as being hard to commit because of seeing so many good possibilities.

isfj,"you all deserve better descriptions it?s bad enough that sensors get shitty descriptions , but i think si users get hit it worse than an se user . they see someone who is judgmental , rude , homophobic , etc . and they immediately think , ?oh that?s my momdad !? but like , not all types are like that . and i?m saying this as someone who is questioning right now if they are one . to be honest , i?m a teen , and i only got into mbti to figure out what was wrong with me i honestly wish i could quit , but now i?m just stuck in this series of over analyzing myself and wondering if this is who i am . i know i?m a sensor and i feel extroverted , because i feel like i need to be around people , or i?ll get lonely and start having dark thoughts . it?s weird because i?m usually between type or type , which are shadow functions of each other . because i feel like i?m both . like i act confident and i?ll say and do stuff without thinking and i?m impulsive . and i care about being true to myself and i can also relate to ni grip and a te loop . but i can also relate to the ti loop as well , when it comes to focusing on past mistakes , and trying to figure out what the connection is to who i am , and if it means anything . like si for example , comes when i organize , like i organized my binder yesterday and that made me feel really good as well as cleaning my room and getting my room done , and i got up early to make my lunch and get ready in time , which made me feel good knowing i had everything done . or like se when it comes to improvising , it can depend , but like for assignments or school or something , i?m good at it . like i?ll do assignments or essays at the last minute and get ait happened with an assignment i did yesterday . when it comes to fe , it?s a weird thing . because when someone starts crying , i don?t really cry . i?ll feel sad and want to help them though , in any way possible . and i?ll check up on them . i also frequently vent to my friends or i would vent online , which is something i need to work on , because i barely know how to deal with my feelings . i also feel like i can be a burden and annoy people . when it comes to ti , it usually comes as wanting to do the quickest thing possible or finding easy solutions to things or constantly re editing my thoughts and why i say and type , like what i am doing now, but i would also say that is te . for ne , i usually use it to say weird what if scenarios , like what if i just drank that weird shit or something idk , but i also use it to think of negative what if?s and think that everything is going to go wrong and it?ll be like that always . but idk maybe it?s also ni . but this turned into me rambling basically , i think you all deserved more credit . i barely see any good descriptions , only a few . you guys have such terrible stereotypes , which could make a lot of people not get their actual type , especially when it?s si . so yeah."

esfp,"in the past two years , i' ve had this continuous sense of fatigue from using my introverted sensing function . recently , i' ve begun to shift some attention into extraverted sensing activities that my opposite types do so i can better learn and be more balanced some day . so , what do you types like to do ? and more importantly , how do you do it or engage with it ? is there a certain mentality that you bring to your daily activities ? i think it is critical that i pick up an extraverted sensing activity now because sometimes i can literally feel a strong disconnect between myself and the world , as if an invisible wall blocks me from experiencing the world , and that the physical world is only an alternative to my actuallyreal inner world . this perception of the world is even stronger when i spend days in solitude working on something . when i come out of the cave , i perceive everything i see as almost an impressionistic collage( luckily , this doesn' t happen too often). i' ve thought about painting the visions i see , but what' s the point ? the age of prophets is long gone . plus , i am not good with colors . so yea , any suggestions ? happy"

infj,"there seems to be a general consensus flowing throughout the mbti community that nps and neusers account for the most creative of all the types . why ? i call utter bullshit on this . the first reason being that this sort of thing is subjective and therefore a declaration of one type' s apparent creative superiority is dreadfully unfair . i suppose the general view may just be that nps possess greater motivation to be creative due to their fiexpressionism . but creativity doesn' t necessarily have to involve expression . the second being that i ' m inclined to believe that creative appreciation is biased towards the neworld simply because we see it more often . type is the rarest type and not only that , but the only nifueled type likely to be driven towards artistic endeavors( although still not as many as i would have thought ). xntjs are likely to utilize their ni in a more analytic fashion and types are fe dominant and thus likely to use it as more of a tool to support their socially oriented activities . neusers on the other hand have the almighty types and types at their disposal . i present myself as an example of my point( assuming i ' m correctly typed ). ever since childhood i' ve always possessed an almost overwhelmingly powerful imagination . it has become one of my most valued traits within myself . i will lose myself in imaginative movies like pan' s labyrinth or inception . i' ll gaze for hours at the work of dali or h.r . giger( i salivated when prometheus came out ). when bored , i' ll envision the most vividly bizarre things in my head . you have no idea . any insightdiscussion regarding this topic would be interesting . feel free to disagree with anything above . how do you think an ni imagination and associated creations would differ from that of an ne' s ? examples ? opinions?"

isfj,"before i start , i want you to know , that the nicest person i have ever known is an type . and that i have been called an asshole many times , just for letting people know my thoughts on different topics . i am starting this thread , because i have searched the type forum and the only thread i found about the type asshole( yeah , i know , that' s quite subjective )was about type super villains in which people concluded that the type can at the most be some sidekick , which probably is against their will( wormtail was a really good example ). however , i ' m convinced that somebody i know is not only an type , but also a selfish egomaniac . let me explain i see a lot of sife . if you spend some time with him , you can literally see the si . he puts everyone and everything neatly into categories , and if someone or something has once been put away , it' s quite unlikely for his opinion to change on that .( exception someone or something that lately disappointed him , which can happen because of literally nothing . it' s unbelievable , how quickly he can throw that thing or person into another box in his brain in that case ). on the outside , he' s able to get along well with people , even though he is clearly an introverted person who needs much time for himself . he' s being perfectly nice to everyone on the outside , but examines their weaknesses while communicating with them , so he can expand the boxes he put people into . then he evaluates a way to deal with them via their insecurities and uses the weaknesses people have against them systematically . he does this in a very soft way , so people might not even notice that they are manipulated , but they clearly are . i have seen him doing this many times , and he tries it with everyone . he has quite an impact on many people , but him trying to convince people he' s close with about what they did wrong( bc he' s easily offended , but won' t look for the reason within himself )may be the reason he doesn' t have many close friends . the only one that comes to my mind is his girlfriend , who he doesn' t really care about( sending his ex text messages about how he loved and missed her on the day his gf and he moved in together is just one little example of his assholery ). i' d like to know about your thoughts on this topic."
infj,"my mom has been a fan of edgar cayce her entire life . she is visiting me , and we went to the a.r.e . center , which is somewhere she had visited someyears ago , in virginia beach . she had remained subscribed to this group pretty much her entire life , contributing money regularly and so on to help ensure this place is a success over the decades . she spoke about edgar cayce a lot to me , and conveyed a lot of his teachings to me . it has always been an important part of my life , and yet , it' s not well known or talked about in modern culture . i also did not fully understand the significance in my life , until a significant other came into my life . it is so randomly unlikely but anyway . i see some threads here on personalitycafe about him , but usually in passing and they are old , so i figured i' d post some pictures of the area which i took today and hopefully get some information from anyone who has knowledge to share about him , or insights they have had from his teachings or whatever . i actually know nothing about the man outside of the many stories my mother has told . i had not ever been to this location before today was my first time there ever , even though i live somewhat close now . the first picture is when we arrived . the parking lot in front of the( closed at this time )visitor center . the suv in the front , midright in the photo , is of some relevance to the story . the second picture of a garden walkway is off to the right of the first picture , and i just took a random picture into the nice parklike area for whatever reason . the third picture is my mom approaching the main building from the farright of the compound . she sees a girl who is pacing the path in the last photo . the fourth picture is of a stairway leading up into the middle building . it has some significance , and i wondered and swelled with emotion , but continued on . the fifth picture is of a walking path or something this dolphin , yinyang , compass , something or the other path . as my mom and i walked up towards this area in the fifth picture , there is a fountain near the main building( the building is seen in the first picture ), and there were stones removed from the fountain and laid out on the edge of the fountain wall . we both intuitively understood the rocks were out of placepeople had placed them there , stacking the rocks , but to the both of us , something was off , and we went over and put all the short pillars of stones back into the fountain . it was odd how we both at the same time understood something was off and even though she commented about we should remove them and put the rocks back into the fountain , i was already on that trajectory . we gently placed the rocks back , and we both felt the relief of it , for whatever it was . she then said the thinks the main building is not open i said , well then you' re wrong . she is an type , and i note that her inferior te is pretty much always wrong . she asked how i knew she was wrong , and i explained that because her thinking came from a position of fear( hard to explain , just go with me on this )that i can conclude she is wrong , because fear is always trying to prevent us from doing the thing we' re supposed to be doing . so , we walked up the steps instead of leavingcurving steps that lead to the main entrance . we get to the top , and we stand around , a paper sign on the door says , closed today , or something to that effect . it' s taped on and slightly curved and blowing in the breeze a little . she pointed at the paper sign and noted it' s closed , and said we should walk down the other side of stairs as we leave . i challenged her is the sign right ? i question signs they don' t always tell us what we think they' re telling us . sometimes , they' re trying to lead us down the wrong path or make the wrong decision . anyway , i just stood there and waited , and she eventually went to the door , reached for the handle , turned it , and. . pulled . and , it opened . i enjoy these moments , not because i was' right 'but because it helps me understand the lessons that i' ve been taught by god , to not live by fear , and to instead live by love . the door opened , and we stepped inside to the very cold air conditioning which provided relief from the heat and humidity we had been enduring walking up here . it was so , so nice , and i fluttered my arms around a bit to impact more cold air and cool off quicker . it was the foyer to the building , with a stand with pamphlets , and three doors , one leading more inside the building , one leading one way around the enclosed outer patio of the building , and another leading the other way around the enclosed outer patio of the building . there were nice chairs and tables in the patio area , for sitting and talking , maybe having food , coffee , and so on , chatting with people , and the main door leading inside to a lit room with seating and nice decor . we looked around a little in this small foyer , around abyfoot space , and then she tried the inner door leading deeper into the main building it did not open . the door to that area was closed . it' s interesting the building was open , but internal chambers were closed . i ' m not sure the significance of this , and sure , you could say , well then it was closed !and i wouldn' t argue i know what' s going on . the building was open , but the internal chamber doors were locked . it was good . we looked around . from above now , we saw the lady walking around the path , tracing the pattern on the walkway , walking in circles and so on . she was maybe talking to herself , wearing a colorful dress and had a piece of paper she was looking at sometimes . i could tell she was in some turmoil . i told my mom that maybe she should talk to this lady and tell this lady that she herself was thereyears ago( it didn' t look like thisyears ago , she commented a couple times ). she responded , no , in such a way i knew she was not going to . we eventually got our fill of the very cold air conditioning , and exited the building . we walked down the other set of curved stairs which lead up to the entrance , and . . right before i left the stairway , i paused at the two pillars on either side of the bottom of the stairs . my mom walked ahead , to the left , maybe heading slightly back to the car , and i paused . is it me ? do i go talk to this person ? it stands out to me i suppose so . i asked god for guidance , and then stepped forward , to the right , towards the path with the lady walking the walkway . at this point , she had sat down in the middle of the walkwaythe dolphin yinyang symbol in the fifth picture . i walked over , and sat down right in front of her . she looked up from the piece of paper she was holding and said hello . i said hello and looked at her . she was in turmoil and sad , and yet she did the social thing of trying to hide it . how are you doing ? i asked . i ' m fine , she responded , kind of holding back her emotion and so on . you don' t seem to be fine , what' s bothering you ? i asked , going right to the core . she bubbled with emotion and began to cry , tears coming out of her eyes someone saw her in pain and noticed her all alone walking the path . she didn' t sob , but she cried , tears of pain held inside . i know these tears . i . . the pools of water that were her tears , they were heavy . it was not light , and it swelled under her entire lower eyelid and then poured down her cheeks . she wore glasses , i think of a blue color , and . . i just remember watching the tears as they formed and fell , the different shapes of pools of water they made under her eyelid . this happened over a few minutes as we initially talked , but as i looked at her into her eyes and questioned her , she was emotional and tearful and this stood out to me . i dug into what was bothering her right awayan type thing , sure , but , just a me thing , too . and of course , she opened up right awayan type thing , sure , but just a me thing , too . she told me how she has a situation where she has to leave people and she is sad and upset and doesn' t know what to do and so on . before digging into the situation further , i asked her about her paper that she held . she told me it was a saying , a reading from edgar cayce , that she had been trying to make sense of this entire time . she had retrieved the piece of paper from inside the visitor center , which was now closed . i asked her if i could read it . it was curled up into a tiny scroll in her hand . she accepted and handed me the paper . unrolling it , i found the back side of it , listing the edgar cayce website . i held it there as i noted something of significance , perhaps just for my own enjoyment of the design in progress . she had obtained this paper from the visitor centerit' s a little thing where you can pick out a random piece of paper , a reading , and just take it , free and so on . it' s something akin to a fortune cookie fortune and what not , where visitors can take one if they want . it' s something my mother and i would have likely found and taken had we been there on time and so on( we' re always on time !). so i noted to her that she got it from there , the visitor center , which was closed to my mother and i . anyway. . i flipped it over and read it . i can only paraphrase here it was an something reading , i don' t know . it stated , again , paraphrased , men who seek material things to satisfy them they often find it . they will find fame , position , power , fortuneit' s all for nothing something is still lacking . key words which were in the actual reading are material ( ism )( istic ), fame , position , power , and still lacking . it' s not concise language , so it' s hard to understand , especially if you are already blind to the message !my paraphrase is much easier to understand the point of the reading . this was significant to this lady , as she had picked it up randomly out of a bunch of other onesthis one belonged to her . i told her that i think i understand the message . she asked me what it was . i told her . if we look to fulfill ourselves with things from the material worldwe will find it . if we want ice cream , can we get it ? yes . we can go to the store and buy ice cream , all manner of flavors , and satisfy ourselves . if we think that is what makes us happy. . it' s for nothing( i think naught was used in the reading ). if we mow lawns , where we are only feeling good because we mow a lawn , we will feel unhappy and unfulfilled , because mowing the lawn will never make us happy . we' ll say we are the lawn mower , but , in doing so , we attach ourselves to the idea , so when we are not mowing the lawn , we are not happy , we are not fulfilled . we can seek out fame , power , position , and fortune , but if we do so as a means by which to fulfill ourselves , that we' re only content when we have x position , x thing in our lives , x material object , we will never be satisfied it is for nothing , something is still lacking . i made sense of that part for her she said she kind of understood that part , but said she was stuck at the end . what is lacking ? i posed the question , guiding her towards the answer . she went around it a couple times , and then i settled her on the point what is lacking , is love . now , it' s kind of amazing , because in the bible there is this exact same concept , this exact same truth . in the bible , there is something about how if you have wealth , but you don' t have love , you have nothing . in essence , this reading is another way of saying the exact same truth . i didn' t tell her this , but it' s important to note how truth is truth and found in all manner of places . she was finishing her tears and told me she thinks this is why she came here today , to get this information from me she came here for answers , and she felt more understanding about her situation . around this time , it began to rain , lightly at first , and then harder , but not storming , through the conversation . the fifth picture shows thisour two dry spots upon the wet ground where we sat . i dug into her situation more , and she revealed her turmoil , that she has been accepted to attend a college for a doctorate degree towards helping people with their hearing , and she is trying to cope with losing her friends and family in the area as she goes into the middle of the country to another college where she knows no one , has no place to stay , nothing set up yet , and so on . she hasweeks before she has to go , and she' s not sure how she' s going to do it and so on . she mentioned how she asked the universe for this , for some change , some way to become better , and she attributes this opportunity to what she asked . i explained that she has nothing to worry about , that she asked correctly !she asked , and the universe( god , but i hadn' t mentioned god yet )had given her what she asked for out of love !that she is being cradled and loved by the universe and being given this gift , where she will be ok if she decides to go , that it' s there for her to be happy about and not stress about . eventually she revealed the spiritual reasoning for her stress . i say spiritual , because i see it clear as day , but she was blind to it . she mentioned how she is stressed because she is not aware how to solve her financial issues to get there , and that love can' t solve everything , and that we live in the world where money is important and so on . i asked her why she wanted to go do the doctorate degree , and she said she wants to do it so she can have money and a good life and not have to worry about money and so on . i expected the answer . i explained to her that when she asked for the universe to help her , to give her this change , she was in the right spot , asking , not demanding , not taking . asking is the right way to submit oneself to the universe and get a response . she did it right , however , her motivation for doing so after the gift had been given had now changed she was not doing it out of love , love to care for children and heal their hearing , or to heal othersshe wasn' t motivated by love , but instead by the desire for money . i explained how once her energy in this direction became thoughts of money and so on , versus being happy and optimistic that she would get to help others , the internal stress and anxiety came and a wall appeared , perpendicular to her path . in short , the universe is almost blocking her way , because she' s going about it for the' wrong 'reasons . in my perspective , god loves us , and will give us what we ask if we are genuine in our reasoning for asking , but if we oppose the reasoning and act selfishly , not out of love , he has no problem letting us struggle against our inner self , loading us down with worries and stress and anxiety the stress , fear , anxiety , resistance , is evidence that the action is not being done with love . i went on to tell her how if she is acting out of love , she would have no issue going to every bank in the area and trying to get a loan , or asking all her friends and family for support and help , so on and so onlove will find a way !that if her motives were for the love of others , to help others , nothing would get in the way and she would make it happen no matter what . she' d go into debt or do what it takes to make it happen . i could tell that she could not accept thisshe' s not in love with her dream , she' s in love with the life she thinks she will have if she gets the doctorate and is finally happy due to her material accomplishment . she was not willing to accept this in her spirit , i could tell . it mattered too much for her , the money , the life in her mind it wasn' t for love , and she struggled in that moment with the idea . we began talking more she attends a buddhist temple nearby . i got to asking her about things , coming back to the universe who she asked for her gift , and. . i asked her , who is the universe ? she avoided the term , revolving around it in different ways . eventually i made the connection she understood but was unwilling to approach the universe is god . she agreed but said she thinks it is a universal energy , the source , she said , and that different cultures and religions call this different things . i agreed , and explained that , to make it easier to communicate , we can just call that energy , that source , that mystical thing , that unknown , whatever it iswe can simply call it god . in this way , we can communicate easier . i went on to explain that i know how the modern religions and churches have twisted things and corrupted the view of things to make god become a bad word for a lot of young people . i explained that no matter what someone calls god , be it the universe , allah , the source , or any other term , any at all , whatever it is you want to call godgod knows your heart and knows you' re talking to him when you' re talking to him . so , if you can be brave , you can use the word that commonly connects you with others who believe in god , believe in the universe , and so on . she didn' t like iti could recognize her hesitation , because i was once there . i fell for the trap of evil which makes people think the word god is a bad word , versus an easy way to convey a common understanding of the creator in common language . i walked her around her own position , eventually leading her to admit that it doesn' t matter what any religion calls this energy , this creator . ah , my job was done , she has taken my own position it will take some time for it to settle into her mind that she' s avoiding the use of the word god simply due to stigma . i tested her in a way as well during this part , preparing her for the question first , and then asking her , do you believe in god ? her inability to answer as she stared off in thought was very telling . she knows god means the universe , the creator , buddha , and anything elseall cultures and all people are talking about the exact same energy , just perceiving it differentlyand yet here. . the stigma , the corruption of the word here in this country , she could not say it , even though she could probably say she believes in the universe and buddha or whatever else . the conversation began to fall apart . i could tell she wanted to leave we were wet from the rain and sitting on the hard ground was uncomfortable . i would have sat there all day and night if she wanted to , if she needed to , but it was more that it was uncomfortable and other thoughts of people she knows popped into her mind . i kept my presence , fully there as long as she needed , and eventually as the conversation dithered out due to her subtle motions that she' s ready to go on , she said she had to go meet some friends , thanked me , shook my hand and we stood up and parted ways . my mother was sitting the whole time on the fountain wall behind me . she got rained on , too !she' s awesome . i walked the short distance over to her and we talked a few moments . i explained a tiny bit of the story to her , and we walked slowly down towards the car , through the stairway in the middle of the first picture . the girl was in her car , that suv , looking at her phone , as we walked by to our car . i waved at her goodbye again and we continued to our car the lady left as we got into our car , and then we proceeded to head home."

estj,"introductions myself( f )type my husbandtype my friend( m )type this is longwinded because i don' t want to miscommunicate the context here , so tldr.i can' t tell if my type friend is starting to show interest in me now that i ' m married and what to do about it , if anything ? the long version.i' ve been friend' s with type for a long time . we didn' t see each other often , but we went through a lot of trustaffirming , surprisingly deep experiences together . i know how he gets when he' s romantically interested in someone . and i' ve observed over the years that his behavior in our friendship was kept in a strictly different category than how he pursued prospective partners . since i married my husband , type has grown to be a friend of his as well , despite the fact that type is a ceaseless jokester and his trolling peeves type . we' ve all been steadily hanging out as a trio more frequently since lockdown and i thought this was because of our assurance in each other' s health and his added friendship with type . all good and gravy to me . i ' m starting to wonder if that' s actually the case , though . type and i get along about as well as i' d expect in marriage and we' re five years in , but there is admittedly tension with his carefree impulsivity , especially with money even though i ' m impulsive too , money is something i don' t play around with and type pointed this out one night , saying how exhausted i get at having to reign type in all the time , which depressingly enough is not wrong . this is making me take keep mental tabs , though . since work has kept all three of us in our homes , type' s getting a little more demanding of attention , i ' m becoming a little more guarded for want of some solitude , and i ' m noticing type' s starting to do things around us that he usually does when he likes someone . type started following me on reddit last year not a big deal , but i found his sudden interest in my frequent reddit haunts a bit peculiar . having worked with p.i.s , i know the databases to access public records and personal info.i know type uses one of them to backgroundcheck his dates.nothing odd about that , until i noticed him looking at my info on that database one night , and he wasn' t really trying to hide what he was searching on his phone , either . another thing he' s started doing that he' s only ever done before for dates is when he comes over to hang out , he' ll bring over fooddrink that even though all three of us snack on , are things i' ve specifically stated that i would like to try . now he' s also starting to call out type more on things that aggravate me . i' ve never gone into detail with type about things that type aggravates me with in our marriage . it' s putting my marriage in a really awkward spot , because things i dislike and usually brush off for the sake of peace and quiet are being shoved in the spolight . i' ve called type out on the changes i made it pointblank clear he' s acting different and there' s a reason . i told him to stop stirring the shit pot in my marriage . type didn' t deny he' s acting differently , but he wouldn' t own up and tell me the reason why . even though he relented and promised he would stop stirring things up , he shot back pretty angrily that i , .need to start speaking up when type pushes it . not that it' s gonna change how things are going to go . and he wouldn' t elaborate further . i asked him later if we' re still friends , given how angry he was and he assured yes . i ' m not unaware of what' s happening , but i can' t figure out the' why. 'type seems unfazed , they still invite each other over to hang out . i ' m just confused.trying to maintain my friendship , my marriage , and wondering what to expect next , if anything and this all has my brain fried . i ' m hoping some other types could lend some perspective on what' s changed here , why , and how to handle it ? i apologize this dragged on and if it doesn' t make any sense."

enfj,"the different enneagram types have a very distinguishing effect on how types manifest their personalities . each enneagram type creates a different type of type . this is because each enneagram type affects how the type uses their fe . first , let' s define fe . at it' s core , fe is simply feeling and extraversion . those who prefer feeling tend to come to decisions by associating or empathizing with the situation , looking at it' from the inside 'and weighing the situation to achieve , on balance , the greatest harmony , consensus and fit , considering the needs of the people involved . click to expand. . myersbriggs literature uses the terms extraversion and introversion as jung first used them , and preserves the original spelling of extraversion . extraversion means outwardturning and introversion means inwardturning . these specific definitions vary somewhat from the popular usage of the words . the preferences for extraversion and introversion are often called as attitudes . briggs and myers recognized that each of the cognitive functions can operate in the external world of behavior , action , people , and things( extraverted attitude )or the internal world of ideas and reflection( introverted attitude ). the mbti assessment sorts for an overall preference for one or the other . click to expand. . when we combine these factors , the result is something much more encompassing than the simple factor of ?caring about people? ? which is honestly a misnomer based on the misinterpretation of the use of the word' extroversion '. jung?s definition is spelled' extraversion 'to make the distinction between social attitude and mental perspective . the definition of fe is much broader than that , and is more literally ?feeling based reasoning oriented outwardly? ? that being the case , how each of us manifests our fe is strongly influenced by our enneagram type . while mbti type indicates perspective , enneagram indicates our motivations . for types , this means enneagram type will flavor the focus of our fe because our outward feelings are influenced by our motivations . type? in this type , fe manifests most strongly as a sense of right and wrong , how things should be . in this type , we see fe?s drive to control the user?s environment and apply ideological truth more so than fe?s desire to care about others . typetypes are commonly w . type? this is the most common type for types , and therefore it?s no surprise that with this type , fe manifests as a care and concern for others . because this combination is so common , a lot of the standard description of types includes enneagram typesensibilities . if you?re a different enneagram type , this will explain why some of the type description isn?t quite accurate for you . type? fe manifests as a sense of how things should be , and creates the drive to make them so . there is also an expectation of others ? reaction , as well as a clear sense of where the individual should be socially . typetypes are commonly w . type? fe manifests as a sense of how things should be both for the individual as well as their environment in a rather self oriented manner , insisting on aesthetics , conventions , and their unique tastes . these types can be very elitist and feel very passionately about these things . typetypes tend to have a notably strong ni that can often confuse them with types or types . type? these types are quite rare , but when they manifest as type s , these types feel very strongly about what they know to be correct and incorrect , as well as their need to be useful to the people they care about . typetypes often have a strong ti . type? these types manifest their fe in a balanced mix of concern for others , their social status , security , loyalty , ideology , and their physical environment . this is a less common enneagram type for type , but is actually the most balanced use of fe , focusing on everything fe is used for rather evenly . type? fe manifests itself in a whirlwind of care for others through the need for fun . these types are the life of the party . while other type s can be very self serving in their pursuit of fun , excitement , and happiness , type s use their fe to make sure everyone else is having fun too . in a way , type s are much like lively s . type? these types primarily manifest fe?s need for right and wrong and to control their environment because of a need for justice in an unjust world . fe?s sense of how things should be includes self sufficiency , strength of character , and independence , which can seem paradoxical to fe?s standard definition . type s almost always have a strong se and are often ws . type? fe manifests as a desire for harmony in the environment through fe?s sense of how things should be . for an type, things should be harmonious . right and wrong , caring for others , and control of the environment are also important , but are secondary to the imperative for harmony . type s are often ws."

enfj,"oh boy !here we go laughing i' ve come from a long hiatus to yet again , discover more about the inner workings of types tongue i ' m curious about type and sex . i ' m struggling to form a question here because i don' t have a particular question , just a desire to understand what makes types tick sexually frustrating there' s the problem of , every type having different desires ? so to cover this topic generally. . how to phrase this question. . mmmmhh . if you had to create your ideal sexual partner in terms of their attitude( let' s forget physique lol )what would it be and why ? please be as detailed as possible but also try to perhaps selfreflect on why you believe it works for you . i can say this being an type and nidom. . i' ve read a lot about how an type' s sexual experience is spiritual , and i don' t know if i necessarily agree with that . i think , the best way to sum up an type' s sexual experience isn' t so much that it' s spiritual but rather that the experience itself is magnified by the intensity of a soultosoul connection with the person they have fallen in love with ? so the deeper the bond , the more pleasurable and exciting sex' can 'become . trust i believe is a huge factor for types , but also on the complete opposite spectrum. . with type' s having inferior se , if an type is on an sebinge they can be an animal . i think how this manifests itself in a relationship for an type is that most types are kind of like caged sexual beastswaiting a lifetime for that special person who willingly locks themselves in and play with us for eternity laughing( did i give away an type secret ? whoops !lol )i often view sex , as the mechanical( body ), the mind , and then the emotionalrelational( you could say is' spiritual 'but i think of it more as a level of trust that allows one to' let go 'of the world and get lost for a moment and then fall back into the arms of someone special instead of just falling ). often times i think of casual sex as mechanical , and sometimes if the person you' re with is creative enough( engages your mind )you maybe can get off if you can let go of your inhibitions entirely( i don' t think most types can ). even if they' re not the most engaged mentally , if you' re able to stimulate your own mind , you can make it work too( ie just using each others bodies to get off ). i think the emotionalrelational aspect is what throws the experience to a new level . being nidom , i' ve noticed that sex is most enjoyable if it engages , at the very least the body and mind . if the brain is not engaged , everything seems to fall flat . if relational aspect is copacetic , then it' s a dream come true for any type . since types and types share the same cognitive functions in a slightly different order , i wonder a lot about how an type gets the most out of sex ? being a fedominant , do you feel that types get off on sex slightly differently from other mbti types ? i wonder how fedominant plays into the whole thing or if it has nothing to do with it at all . i wonder if fe is extra focused on the other person where as nidom is more focused on the idea of something happening . i ' m hoping that i ' m making some sense here i' ve been thinking about this alot , and i just wonder. . sometimes i think types being nidom can get off on what' s happening instead of necessarily being entirely in the moment . it' s like , the' idea 'of it is enough to work it' s magic . where as i wonder if fe is more focused on the give and take in that moment ? how the person is looking at you , how you' re making them feel which in turn is making you feel ? etc. . so , quick overview)if you had to create your ideal sexual partner in terms of their attitude( let' s forget physique lol )what would it be and why ? please be as detailed as possible but also try to perhaps selfreflect on why you believe it works for you .)how does fedom affect your sex life ?)do you feel that types get off on sex slightly differently from other mbti types ? curious to hear your thoughts types !"

estp,"hi guys , i ' m new to the forum and hope you could help me out . recently my type exchange friend fromyears ago came to my country for a holiday . i kind of fell for him after one day of bringing him around and decided to sleep with him , messed up , and he ignored the photo that i posted of us . what does he think of me ? does he still respect or like me ? and if not , what can i do ? my impression was that he' s the life of the party , never knew him well . he messaged me sporadically over the years teasing me about exchange shenanigans , called me innocent for choosing love and commitment , said that all men cheat and love is an idea invented by movies , called me all grown up and he wants to' eat me ', called me a good girl , asked about my country , asked whether it' s easy to hit on girls here , linked me up with his friend who was looking for work in my country . i' ve commented that he will never be the good guy who gets married , and he said he' s a kind guy . i' ve always brushed off his comments and replied neutrally . i was pleasantly surprised after catching up with him . he' s driven at work and flies internationally to make things happen . proud of the fact that he' s learned more from expanding a startup instead of being a cog in a large mnc . he goes ahead with his plans until the boss scolds him . when he scolds his team , he forgets about it the next day but they remain jittery . i type him as type , enneagram w or w . relationship wise he' s been cheated on by his first gf . left his second gf hanging onoff for five years . had a short relationship during exchange and he fucked around more after working . he said i ' m insecure about my ex( because his ex contacted him and i was unhappy she said inappropriate things )and that romantic love like that isn' t good because it made him jealous and accept more than he should from his cheating ex . he had standards though , when his second ex contacted him while being attached he felt that was wrong( that kind of contradicted my stand with my ex ? double standards ). he knew i was in a funk over my career transition and shared his own experience and some great advice , and i appreciated he wanted to help when he sensed i was keeping a cheerful front . he was touching me , teasing me , calling me crazy , repeating my phrases , when i played the piano he was impressed( his sister plays the piano and i think it' s a' thing 'for him ), discussing current affairs and companies at the forefront of ai and automatiom , played intense eye contact games with me . at other random moments , he mentioned my proper english , that i ' m smart , that he liked that i was open to new people and experiences . he also asked what i thought about him and i jokingly said' a pain in the ass 'because he mentioned that people say that about him a lot . at the end of the night , when i kissed him and hinted that i wanted to sleep with him he was shocked because he always saw me as innocent , and he was even more shocked that i' ve only slept with two guys . he also thought that me waiting one year after my breakup to date was too long . he was a bit protective and kept asking me if i was drunk , then flipped a switch . he became a bit cocky ? humped me against a lamp post when we were flagging a cab , asked me to split the alcohol bill with him , asked me to pay the cab fare .( i don' t know , making use of me now that he knows i like him ? ). he was too rough with me , and didn' t let up when i was in pain , he fingered me and triggered my second period when the first just ended days ago . i was freaking embarrassed and said i should leave . he went so what should i do with a hard on ? and i started giving him a blowjob . halfway through , i felt really cheap and used and said i ' m not getting anything from this and left . i was really conflicted and didn' t want things to end badly( people pleasing type urgh )and asked him if he wanted to meet for dinner the next day . he declined as he was accompanying a colleague and didn' t reply when i asked if i could send him off at the airport . at the airport , he said that he felt i was selfish when i said i wasn' t getting anything out of this . to him he felt he couldn' t have done anything since i was bleeding . but i thought he was really insensitive and not aware that after a year of not having sex i needed some foreplay instead of a wham bam thank you ma ' am . i accidentally insulted him when i said my ex had a larger dick , probably could have put the point across without reacting from my shame and hurting his ego , that it' s not about size it' s about the patience and care . i asked him if he liked me , he said he liked me for showing him around more attractions than he could in one day . i asked if he he was attracted to me he said i ' m an attractive girl . my heart was sinking and i just said so you aren' t attracted to me more than a friend and he went well i could' ve visited prostitutes with my colleague but i didn' t( what ? )and love can' t be said , it has to be experienced . when i was looking around for a sofa that could seat two so i could cuddle him he was pissed that i was looking around and not focusing on himhe also said he didn' t cuddle urgh . my selfesteem was shot after that lol . i get the sense that he was trying to ask if i set aside time for him especially . and when i said he' ll find a nice girl one day( out of resignation that he probably doesn' t like me and would never come back to my country unless he relocates for work )he said maybe the girl will get tired of him being a pain in the ass . he noticed that i travelled a lot with my ex which showed he' d been stalking me . he asked about my travel plans( he' s a huge travel junkie ). he said i insulted his looks and figure( it was just teasing !)and that he thought i felt obliged to continue hanging out with him at night( i was just trying to hold back tears as i really enjoyed time with him and wanted to spend more time with him lol ). when he was about to enter the departure gates i was vibrating with hesitation and he hugged me twice . and said that he might be coming again end of the year for a conference . i decided to post a picture of us with a flattering caption about him( which was not meant to flatter just the truth about what i loved about him spreading happiness and fun , being positive and trying to bond with local ppl )and he didn' t like both the fb and ig posts  ! while posting lots of new pictures . why is he ignoring the posts ? i like and admire him but my brain knows he' s still sowing his wild oats , has a few girlfriends and side chicks . i like that glimpse of a caring person but what happened in bed turned me off , and must have turned him off as well . i don' t regret wanting to give him something after a whole day of insane chemistry but it backfired so bad . did i lose his respect ? was he even interested in me romantically or was he just enjoying my company as a friend ? obviously i don' t know what' s an type' s baseline behaviour . and if by a fluke he comes back end of this year what can i do to build attraction again ? i kind of want to write him a sincere letter now in the mindset of someone who' s never going to see him or be with him again as i want to properly end things on a good note and acknowledge all the great things about him . i can' t exactly show love by action , the only thing i can use are words . should i write the letter to mend bridges or will he just scoff at my naivety ?

isfp,"what ' a your eq( empathy quotient )result as an type ? on this one that i took , i got a score of, which is above average . on this one that i took twice , i got aand then a, which is just barely average , and almost in the aspergers range i ' be never been diagnosed with aspergers syndrome . i do have a mild form of spastic hemiplegic cp on the right side of my body due to a prenatal stroke , and i have been diagnosed with adhd and ocd , though i am treated with medication for both . most people i' ve asked don' t consider me socially inept . i ' m not usually outwardly social , but i don' t consider myself unempathetic . i guess , i was just thinking about it and feeling selfconscious about it because my brother who is probably type and overly critical of other people' s flaws said that i was too blunt with my refusals of other people and oblivious to the feelings of other people . i explained that that wasn' t true , and that i just like to be true to myself before i am of other people . i immaturely said that i like to please myself more than i enjoy pleasing others , and that he was too much of a people pleaser . but in all seriousness , i ' m not insensitive to the feelings and opinions of other people . i can put myself in their shoes , and i can feel what they are feeling . but i ' m just not good at outwardly showing my empathy for other people , i tend to feel more emotionally detached if someone else is talking to me about something that they consider important that i don' t , and if they go against the grain of what i feel is right for myself i can be blunt if they don' t take me seriously . i know that sounds selfish , but isn' t that often true for most fi types ? anyway , what was your eq score ? in the two quizzes above ? were they different ? were they the same?"
esfj,"type women.so , i dated two types in the past . the last relationship lasted a bit over a year and they were both really good relationships . this seems to be a pattern , theres something about types thats really draws me in and its fun and exciting . im wondering if its the same the other way around , im type."
istj,"hello , i am a female type and recently broke up with my type boyfriend . we have been together foryears . throughout our relationship , we maintained an onoff relationship , and the main cause of the' offs 'since the very first , is that we can' t understand each other very well . he' s been ignorant and very sharp to me( i think it' s just his type side ), and i have been too demanding for him( he finds me illogical ). he' s always the one who call it quits every time . i always apologize to him when things go rough( even though i know it' s not really my fault ), but he never apologizes . i guess he' s selfish too in nature he never prioritize me over things , he never tried to understand me like i tried for him , even he never appreciates me !he blatantly said that sometimes he' s bored of me , sometimes he just doesn' t care about me , and many things he said that hurt me . but in happy times , he would do anything for me . i know , it' s complicated !after about one and a half year , i managed to adapt with his preferences in the relationship not being too clingy , not being too sensitive , putting much space for each other , holding down my expectations for reassurance , etc . i have used to his sharp mouth . for some time , things happened so smooth and great for us . but in the end of our relationship , he states that he' s more comfortable being alone . he also said that he should' ve broken up with me so that i can be with another better person , unlike him that has been rough on me , he said we' re very different and we will never match . actually his sayings( comfortable being alone , should' ve let me with another person )have been lingering during our relationship , but i guess this time is different because he doesn' t show the same energy when we' re on a trip together lately . and i can say that this is kinda out of the blue because i thought i have adapted with his ways in the relationship . so he asked for a break , by not seeing each other in a month , he said so that maybe i will find another person or decided to go out of this relationship . i really don' t get him because i have been doing so much for him , but he always tried to push me around . i get exhausted sometimes but i always try and try and try for him . he never have the will to try to fix our relationship , he never does anything , it' s me who' s always adapting for him . after a long consideration , i decided to broke up with him before doing the one month break , because i see it clear that he states he' s more comfortable to be alone . i sent a break up letter but he didn' t reply it . but he expressed his sadness on social media. . i am now back and forth on thinking whether i should let this be or i should get back with him . i still love him so much , and i still want to do anything for him . now i ' m thinking , am i wrong to break up with him ? maybe i should' ve done the one month break thing ? i thought the break wouldn' t give any much different on our relationship as he' s always been rough on me . is he serious when he said he wanted to be alone ? or is it just he' s being driven with his emotions ? why do i have given so much for him but he never appreciates me ? is everything that i' ve done for him indeed doesn' t mean anything for him ? why doesn' t him have the will to fix the relationship too , even though he always knew that i did everything for the relationship ? would he contact me , would he even want to get back together ? i seek answers in this forum , because i have never found anyone like him , and all my friends don' t get him too . i ' m sorry if this was really a long post , but i just wanted to show the details . i really wanted to know the type perspective on this issue. . thanks ! "
esfp,"ok , so an type that liked me since we were young.in fact we were each other' s first everything( kiss , etc )found each other after more thanyears thanks to fb . so , he made professions of you' re my soulmate and i want to marry you and make future plans and all this stuff and said i love you immediately when were started talking on the phone . i was hesitant to say it in case he was full of bs and not genuine and just in the moment.but i eventually started saying it back . he' s in the middle of a divorce , he lives with an exgirlfriend right now that he claims he has no feelings for and is just a roommate and has his own room.he just lost his job. . he' d tell me how much he loved me and wanted to see me and marry me and be with me forever.then says how a kid that he recently found out is his.and had been adopted and is an adult that he just found out about.comes first and this very kidadult made an ultimatum.that he had to choose between her and i. . and my type suddenly stopped talking to me.then days later emailed me and told me what happened and that he told his kidadult that he had to do the right thing and that he loves me . then tells me that the kidadult comes first.and if made to choose again with another ultimatum.that he' d choose her( his kidadult.she is married with kids of her own and has a huge family.i don' t get why the ultimatum ? ). when he stopped talking to me.he had sent a last text to make it sound like it was my fault and that i was the one breaking up with him.and he changed his phone number . like i said , days later he sent me an email and then started calling me again . it shocked me.i said , why can' t you choose us both ? why choose one or the other ? i don' t understand ? and he' d say he loved me and called me every night and complain about having to talk on the phone every time . so , me being an type wanted to take a step back and was overwhelmed.i asked for a break from talking on the phone and told him that i' d rather he just text and not call . he took this to mean that i broke things off with him.or used it to manipulate and use as an excuse to claim i wanted to break up . he' s been insecure from day one of seeing my pictures and seeing my achievements and life that i have.he had said he felt like if i hadn' t moved after my dad died that he would had been different and feels like he was never himself and that he didn' t achieve who he was meant to be without me.and that he feels i' d complete him , etc . he said so many times that all he could think about is what he would had been like had i not been taken away to another state following my dad' s death when i was in high school . anyway , i haven' t heard from him and think he' s basically rejected me . he stopped texting and calling last week.and hasn' t returned my calls , texts or emails . was he just playing me all this time ? is he a womanizer ? ? he said he doesn' t understand me or who i am.i gave him a link to read up on type' s.i don' t think he read it . he only read his personality , type and felt it was accurate about him . he definitely got hurt that i wanted to stop talking on the phone and take a break from the phone for a while and only text and didn' t understand my need to take a step away from the phone . i just got tired of him complaining about calling me every time he called and tired of him saying that his adult kid that he just found out about.comes first and how if she made him choose again.he' d choose her , because she' s blood and you' re nothing but an exgirlfriend those words hurt me and i guess he doesn' t care or get it ? i also found some of his behavior to be manipulative and gameplaying at times . he told me that he was tired and hates the phone but still called , because he needed to and because i needed him to . however , he told me that he talks to his adult kid on the phone a lot after finding her a few weeks ago( they talk several times per day and he tells her everything.it' s kinda weird.he told me that he talks to her the same way he does me.which i was like , where' s the boundaries ? and he didn' t know what boundaries meant.i explained.i think he was offended )and he talks to a ton of other people.so , by the time he calls me or i called him.he didn' t want to talk and would complain and make excuses to hang up . i can tell he gets his emotional needs met by his adult kid( that was adopted and he found only a couple weeks ago )as well as from his roommate the exgirlfriend.so , i think he just doesn' t really need me and that' s why it was easy for him to just stop communicating completely and break it off . i ' m thinking about giving up . i emailed him yesterday to tell him that i love him and stuff . he still has not bothered to call , text or email me back . i already deleted him off my fb.i did it to heal and get over him so that i wouldn' t have to see his face every time i logged in . i tried to explain why i needed a break and didn' t want to talk on the phone for a while and to only text.but he never responded . and by the way , i never make this many attempts to work things out and communicate( i usually move on ) .he was special to me.and i ' m not clingy or needy.i just really hoped to work things out with him.but he' s so stubborn and possibly maybe he is just a womanizer or something ? i don' t know ? i hope this makes sense to someone ? thanks in advance for your advise and help . kitteh"
entj,seems like everywhere you look groups are being turned against each other.tensions are building all over the globe it doesn' t seem like the world is headed in a good place . your thoughts?
entj,which test is scientific mbti or enneagram ? ? why people are born with a particular type ( is there a supernatural power behind this )? ? what is the correlation between mbti and enneagram? 
infj,kiersey really thought that type' s were especially kind and loving . but certainly that can' t be true of all of us . i ' m sure there are some that have psychobiological problems that warp them . others may have been so deeply traumatized that they become jaded and shut down cold . what are your ideas ? what might cause an type to become truly evil ? what kinds of evil might an type do ? can you think of any evil type' s?
entj,i love y ' all when you' re thinking. it' s so linear and congruent over all . mm !have a big fat kiss? .
estj,"i ' m wondering what i should look for to indicate a compatable personality type to me , but also , how to relax a bit because i am naturally more tense than most people . i wish dating would be simpler i like you , you like me , lets go out but i think i ' m over thinking it . i don' t know anymore."
infp,"i recently figured this out . it' s a big relief . i can see all the things i have been through , for which i held myself singularly responsible , in new light . a four , seven , or nine year old cannot be held responsible for the ton of things i have felt responsible for . eventually some narcissistic tendencies developed in me too and i was rather uncomfortable with those . i spent many years in my twenties trying to reach them where there was no one to reach . i exposed bits of my vulnerable past . my grandiose narcissist father just ignored it and my covert narcissist mother threw a tantrum . it was a cyclical trap that i was stuck in . eventually i got out . i have been financially independent for about a year . i feel constantly drawn towards them . the sense of inner emptiness , lack of those relationships that i imagined in idealized forms for much of my life is biting . there is guilt as well for abandoning my parents . there is a sense of responsibility towards my younger brother who is still trapped there( he is not marrying for he is afraid he would be stuck there forever ). my older sister seems lost forever . this is too much of a strange reality to come face to face with . it looks like i have no relations left . all the people in my relatives are under enormous debt from my father( favours or finance )and they always praise my parents . i have worked hard and sacrificed much to get out of that shadow . but this isolation is very debilitating . i guess i have some need for admiration myself . at the same time i am also rather uneasy with compliments . at my workplace i am happy to do my work and get out . colleagues are mostly nice . but then when i return home at night , the isolation from the world feels biting . i cannot enjoy anything . i feel inhibited from talking about anything . this stresses my wife and then she goes very careful around my agitated mood , which , in turn , makes me feel even more isolated . my kid is a delight but she is also a handful . i am trying to focus on my own life here . but it is hard . how do i deal with this?"
istp,"you sexy handsome idiots . it' s not like i wanted to get married or chain you up in my basement , you can totally go rock climbing as much as you want , all i wanted was to cuddle and have sex with you a few times a week . but now you went and made it all weird like i was literally asking you to be my boyfriend when all i wanted was a straight answer as to how you feel about me . though i guess i ' m just not ready to be in a relationship is a pretty telling answer , just. . didn' t make sense in the context and made me feel like i was being clingy although i really wasn' t . i ' m not ready for a relationship either . i don' t commit quick . you clearly don' t even know me , but then again , i don' t get you either . from now on i ' m just gonna admire you from a distance and not trust it when you look at me with hearts in your eyes or cuddle me all night . no , but in all seriousness , is this a common type trait ? like , are you typically bad at knowing what you want on an emotional level ? does it change day by day or from moment to moment ? is it even a concern for you , or are you just too invested in whatever your current intellectual interest is to even care much ? hope this doesn' t come across as too snarky , i realize you' re not all identical copies of my crush lol , just getting out some frustration."
esfp,"ed first and foremost i' d like to say how embarrassed i am about the fact that i doppelmoppled the title . for me it' s probably the fact that i dance like a wild animal gone loose . even though i did watch a fewepic dance movesvideos here and there , i' ve never actually actively tried to learn dancing , but i still do and it somehow works . it doesn' t even look half shitty and people love it what is your most unique trait ? recurrences of traits are warmly welcome , since it would only confirm our typeness !laughing"
enfp,"i ' m and type male and i am now dating my nd type woman in a row . the first one did not work out for value , moral and character reasons , not personality differences , plus she abused alcohol , occassionally used recreational drugs and liked to party , at the age of( i am). it was fun and exciting at first , but wore me down over time . i am not an extreme i i am social , i like to go out , and most of my friends think i am an e . but her drinking , partying , late nights , some of the life decisions she made just did not settle well with me . the current type i am seeing(weeks so still nascent )is amazing . in the pastweeks she has had to deal with a mini , rather significant crisis in her life her ex husband is spying on and stalking her . she thinks it' s because of us dating . he' s done this in the past , especially when she first kicked him out of the house and during their divorce . i' ve been the supporter , listener , and she has done an amazing job keeping this out of our relationship and managing it on her own . she has said she has no control over this , she is moving full speed ahead with police , the courts , filing charges , etc and choses to not let this become an obsession in her life . she is trying her best to live a normal life while managing this crisis , too . this weekend , being an type , it caught up with me . it was right ever he walked into a restaurant where we were two days prior . she thinks he did it on purpose , knew we would be there , and was trying to intimidate both of us . there was no communication , no contact , he looked directly at her as he walked in , and kept his back to me the entire time . we left immediately . seeing this , seeing him , made it more real to me . i shut down this weekend , got cold , terse in my text replies , distant , and did not want to see her . i quickly realized my actions and behaviors were wrong , she is a victim , this is not her fault , and in a way i was blaming her . we met to talkdays later . she said me shutting down made her sad , that she needed to be with her gfs over the weekend , which she did , needed low key and no drama , which she did , and needed time to process all of this . she , like me , is now questioning if a nascent relationship has a chance with this crisis in her life . we both agree we don' t know , we like each other , and this really , stinks . we talked for about two hours then she had to go have dinner with a gf . we had dinner plans last night , she had to cancel because of a tough day courts , police , prosecutors , having an alarm installed in her home , a sick child , and an unscheduled evening work meeting . i got mad , felt hurt , rejected , and almost sent a forget about it type of text reply . rather , i took an hour to cool off , realized she needed support , not more dumping from me and texted back i am sorry you had a tough day . i think you are amazing being able to manage all of this . no worries , i understand . that' s not what i wanted to say , but i thought it was what she needed to hear . she immediately replied stating thank you , you just made my day by stating that and understanding . she texted me again a couple of hours later after her meeting to say thank you again for understanding . i kept the texting lite and we said our good nights . she moved things around in her schedule and asked if we could have dinner thursday . so , i ' m here to ask the types , how should i handle this ? what does she need from me right now ? how would you as an type woman be handling this ? have you ever dated and type man , and it worked ? if yes , can you share you experiences and advice ? i am very attracted to her emotionally , personality wise and physically . she makes me smile and laugh . she' s not super affectionate , not a pda person , though i am seeing her come out of her shell a bit over time as i kiss her , try to hold her hand , hug her and such in public . she' s becoming more flirty over text , esepcially since we started being sexual . my last gf was the extreme oppositie , she loved pda , was very touchy feely and affectionate , was very sexual , even in public . the current woman is not very affectionate , which i am struggling with . i never used to be , but i am now , and want to be with her . thanks !

entp,"hello nice people so lately ive been struggling with my feelings a lot and maybe you can help me figure things out . the biggest problem i have , is to develop deeper friendships with the people i have in my life and form a stronger bond with them . while i definitely know , that these people really like me , they never reach out to me for a hangout , but mostly say yes , when i ask them . even though they share deep personal things with me , i always have the feeling , that they never really want to commit to the friendship and it often feels one sided . sometimes i just feel like a trash can for problems . and its that , what i seriously dont understand . i show them my loyalty and trustworthiness . a once told secret has never been mistreated by me and i have no problem putting me out there , be there for support , if neededemotionally and rationally . i feel trusted by all means , but not treated as a friend and i dont know , how to overcome these feelings or behave diffenrently . do i invest too much ? maybe you have a better insight and know , what to do . every comment is welcome"
istj,finish the sentence !. . you make lists of lists . haha) 
estj,"so since i got into this whole mbti thing i' ve been trying to figure out one of my friends 'personality type , i don' t really know why i ' m so hung up on this but i just want to know for sure . my guess is that' s she' s an type because she' s definitely extroverted and sensing , no question about that . i struggle with the whole feeler vs thinker thing though . she isn' t very emotional , or at least not around me and she isn' t very touchyfeely either . i' ve never hugged her and we' ve known each other for almostyears now . when it comes to giving out advice , she always gives solutions( not necessarily god ones )instead of support . whenever i talk to her about careerchoices and other related subjects , she' s always kind of predictable , traditional and boring . i ' m not saying all of you type' s out there are though . she can be very impulsive , like she says stupid , strange and irrelevant things pretty often and can be very attentionseeking which is why i ' m doubting that she' s a thinker . also , she gets very easily offended and can' t take criticism . i don' t think she' s afraid of conflict but sometimes when'' arguing ''with one of the annoying guys in my class she jokes it off and laughs like she' s afraid of them or something . she shares most of the typical judging traits but she is kind of an procrastinator and is relatively unorganized . i ' m a rookie when it comes to myersbriggs stuff so , correct me if i ' m wrong !

esfj,"maybe you guys can help me help him consider some different careers . he is good at school , very responsible . he tends to listen to what careers his friends are interested in and hasn?t gotten a good idea of what he wants to do . he is much more creative than he will own up to and i think he tries to downplay this part of his personality , but i think it might be an area that gives him a lot of joy in actuality . he is creative with computer art and video editing , and especially skilled in tangible art like with textiles , he?s kind of a natural . he enjoys cooking . he also plays blues guitar and is good at piano . he is dependable . i think he likes building computers and knowing detailed knowledge about computer technology . right now he works as a busser at restaurants . he is still a teen . your feedback is appreciated , i?d also like to hear your thoughts on what you were like as a teen and how you found your career path . thank you in advance !

esfp,"i am an type( occasionally type )and i have known an type for a few years . i want to be with him . he experiences highs( energetic , confident , fun , social , likeable )and lows( anxiety attacks , stress , bored easily , feeling like a failure , upset when criticized , catastrophises , histrionic ). we are not in a relationship and we see each other every few months . he works in a different country . sometimes he comes back to my country to visit his family and sometimes i visit that country because i have siblings there . we get along really well and have been friends for a long time . we speak every day and he says i ' m the closest to him . we admitted we had feelings for each other and he said he wants to be with me . however he has no plans to move to my country . i often think about moving but he told me not to move country to only be with him because it' s too much pressure . i understand and i agree with him . however we will not magically be in the same country unless we make a decision and plan . he says he hopes we end up together in the future . my question is in two parts)he tells me every day that he misses me , he wishes i was there etc , he makes up scenarios where we are living together and he jokes about marrying me and meeting his family . i honestly don' t understand why he says these things if he has no intention of us being together . is it a joke ? does he actually want these things ? does he say it because he' s bored and can easily say it to any other girl ? should i tell him to stop saying those things if they aren' t true ? but if i restrict him i worry his feelings would fade if he can' t share with me his daydreams and feelings . should i let him continue so that his feelings grow for me and eventually he will really make plans to be together ?)when i do talk to him about more practical things , such as his plans for us being together , when we are next booking flights to see each other , that i ' m willing to relocate for him etc , he disappears for days( very strange when we speak daily ). sometimes he gets back in contact to tell me i ' m stressing him out , or sometimes i get back in contact with him and try to be light hearted and say sorry for making things serious , then we resume our normal fun , sweet conversation where he tells me he misses me and wants me there . but it' s very annoying because i think i can' t rely on him when things get tough and he' s going to disappear each time he feels like i ' m hinting at commitment . how can you communicate to an type who wants you but doesn' t make plans to be with you ? i ultimately want to end up with him."

estp,i am looking to learn more about each personality type so please answer for your personality . as an type i would give it away and help people that need it more than myself . of course i would keep enough so i would not have to work in the future . but i wonder what others would do with such a large amount of money?
estj,"as described in this thread , all types can apparently go through dominanttertiary loops . i ' m not particularly satisfied with the description there because i think it focuses on nete loops a bit too much . so to get to the point , has anyone else experienced this ? what' s it like ? i think personally for me it leads me to completely disregard what i' ve learned before and to obsessively keep moving forward . this can of course lead to me glossing over details and is ultimately detrimental."
intj,i really need an advice on this one since i been thinking about what to learn to make that goal happened hehe thank you in advance
estj,please tell me your enneagram with wing if you know it . im collecting data for a paper im going to write on correlations between personality typologies.
entj,"i wanted to post this here and get people' s thoughts on this , this is probably the last place i' ll post this too . i feel i got her type down but sometimes there' s some confusion and mistypes out there i' ve seen like type or type which i disagree with in my opinion . boa hancock seems like a clear type and here' s why i think so , feel free to share your opinion down below and what you think . boa hancock is an typemyersbriggs one piece typing boa hancock is a very confident , future oriented , intuitive , and assertive character . she is very head strong , tough , insightful , and logical and she knows how to plan ahead . boa hancock cares a lot about efficiency and has no patience for people most of the time . she doesn' t like when people waste her time and and focuses on handling tasks and is a very structured person . she showcases characteristics of an type and uses a lot of te and ni over other functions and she doesn' t use si all that much to rule out type and doesn' t care for si hardly at all . when momonga shows up to bring her to marineford after calling her to serve in the war against whitebeard and his fleet she lies to him and says she only came to take his cargo and that she doesn' t want to fight in the war at all . momonga gets angry and tells her its her duty and apart of the rules to follow orders as a warlord and serve the marines when necessary . boa hancock as a warlord has to listen to them when summoned by them to do things like fight in the war in exchange of her island being protected and not attacked by the marines since there an island of pirates at amazon lily . boa hancock understands this duty and rule and completely doesn' t care and says no even if she knows he' ll revoke her status as warlord and put her country amazon lily in jeopardy . even with her dark past with the celestial dragons and hating men and the world government , she completely doesn' t care even knowing the consequences of her actions and she completely ignores her duty and rules to follow the marines orders as a warlord and ignores her duty to protect amazon lily as snake princess and pirate empress of the island , which granny nyon scolds her about . granny tells her what will happen if she doesn' t follow her duty and tradition as warlord for the marines , hancock says she doesn' t care and that they' ll forgive her because she' s beautiful and then throws granny nyon out of the window and moves on , showing she doesn' t care much about si or duty and rules at all concerning the marines or her people as pirate empress of amazon lily . having a dark past that haunts you does not mean si , the only si moments she did have is following the no man rule on amazon lily and putting luffy on trial to fight and turning the women to stone and then testing him with the two choices because of her experiences in the past will evil men as a slave . that example was a good counter example but the first one got debunked and lost any weight because she ended up letting luffy stay on the island anyway and breaking the tradition specifically for him once she fell in love . i think hancock is even the only and first pirate empress to break the rule to let a man stay and be allowed to come there anytime because she fell in love with him so it doesn' t even matter because she breaks the si rule and tradition eventually here anyway , the exception is specifically for luffy though but the point still stands of the tradition being broken here by her love . and again her breaking the warlord rule and ignoring her duty to the marines and as pirate empress for amazon lily is a major antisi moment and is way more important and on a bigger scale since that decision she made affects her island being destroyed by the marines . her warlord status will be removed for not following the rules of the marines and their orders and this will destroy amazon lily and she doesn' t care despite it being her duty to do so and care about those things , so because of this she' s not an si user and instead an ni user who just seems to be spoiled in her case . now for examples of ni in hancock . she is very future oriented and insightful , she thinks behind the scenes and is always thinking one step ahead in an ni way when dealing with a situation or problem that needs to be solved . she' s shown to be be clever and crafty with her thinking in the moment in situations and is very good at making good plans on the spot , in a judger way of course . she did a good job getting luffy into impel down and did quick thinking to turn the security to stone and camera . she used her charm to fool magellan when they heard luffy was making a ruckus , she did it again when they got to ace with the prisoners and magellan and distracted them while she told ace that luffy arrived to save him . she then later gets ace' s keys for his handcuffs at the marineford war , she completely planned ahead and thought of the future and figured out that he would need ace' s handcuffs keys to save him and planned that all out ahead of time entirely on her own and then gives them to luffy when she meets him again . she also is always in her head imagining and daydreaming about luffy and is always thinking ahead for the perfect things he needs and isn' t very down to earth and rather focuses on her thoughts and planning more often for another ni point . anyways luffy is happy beyond belief of her perfect thinking and hugs her and then she gets embarrassed , her inferior fi comes out around luffy and she gets flustered and says no problem and says go on to save your brother . all those examples are good ni moments in her and go hand in hand with her te and se and fi as well in the series . boa hancock is type and one of the best ones in the series next to crocodile as well . and arlong as well who is also an type . i type our rubber boy luffy type if you were wondering and i can explain more and why like i have in the past if necessary , i have a post for him coming up since my old post was done so long ago even i still agree with it now and think it still holds up . i also type shiki type from strong world . that' s my thoughts and why i type hancock as a type , and how i see clear te and ni in boa hancock in my opinion , sometimes i do think boa hancock uses fe and si at times when she gawks and overprotects luffy but these are rare cases that are usually exceptions that she only acts and behaves like since she fell in love with luffy . and she simply wants to be a good wife , on a normal basis she uses te and ni more often with her regular personality to fit type better for her and she even uses things like se and reacts on impulse to help luffy during the war for instance so her base personality still shows and stays the same even when she loves and shows affection for luffy anyway with her actions in the story and she still struggles with her inferior fi as well . one piece is still going on at this point in time so i' ll be excited to see more of her character and how she interacts with the characters and how she decides to do things in other situations . thanks for reading."

istp,"hello !i know guys heard this song and dance a thousand times but i ' m still stuck in trying figure out whether i ' m an type or type . i made a few threads in the type me section and get no closer to figuring out . but , it suddenly came to me , why not ask the stps themselves( i know , such an ingenious idea !). appreciative to all input  ! happy demeanori ' m pretty laid back . i ' m quite selfcontained , i ' m just focused on my interests . in terms of relationships , i don' t really have any friends . there' s not really anyone around that share my interests so that exacerbates my selfconfidence issues . i ' m pretty apathetic to people i don' t know . even so , if you ask me for help , i will most of the time . when it comes to decision making , i focus on pros and cons . if the cons outweigh what i want out of a situation to a significant degree , i may not do it . schooling i kind of enjoyed my years in school but not for the schooling . to me , being in school was just part of life , i just focused on the social interaction and extracurricular activities( i.e , combat sparring ). i never resented school but it was generally boring . i got along well with teachers because i rarely disrupted class or got in trouble but i barely did a fraction of the homework . you bet that got my mother a fair share of calls from the school advisers . i was hounded to change my habits , and i did , temporarily . i graduated high school with a c . i barely got into college due to my low act scores but managed to graduate with a. gpa with being on the dean' s list a few times , so standardized tests are a great way to access college readiness. . careerlife goals i really don' t have any . the only thing really want is to be content . i ' m low maintenance in that regard . that also lead to issues . i never knew what i wanted to do . in turn , i can' t really have a career path if i don' t have a career i want to pursue . things that annoying me busy work i hate the concept of busy work , always have . why do something when it isn' t of interest or doesn' t benefit anything in one form or another . this is prominently why i didn' t do as well as i could in high school , just didn' t do the homework . overly sensitivewhiny people they annoying me because they take the fun out of life . i hate to admit it , but a large part of my humor is sarcasm and putting people down( playfully ). this also applies to people who catastrophize everything . i mean , i ' m prone to worrying about things too , but i don' t worry about outcomes that have a extremely low probability of happening . people who can' t let things go this does not often happen to me personally but i hate when people keep bring up old shit to justify the crap they do( excuse my french ). yeah , things have consequences , but don' t bring up things that happened all the way back in high school or generations ago . if it' s not directly affecting you now , don' t talk about it . things that lead me considering each type type over type i' ve been lurking between type and type forums to see who i have more in familiar with . i have to say from observing both camps , i ' m leaning type over type . when looking at the type threads , there' s generally this raw drive to experience all life has to offer , just for the sake of it . for me , i like to experience things but i don' t go out of my way to do so , i just let it happen . i ' m more picky in what i want to do in that i am drawn to things that pertain to my interests or catch my intrigue . i know type' s can be just as quiet as any introvert , but they seem to have this urge to go out and do something . for me , i can be quite content staying in one place as long as i am interested in what' s going on . my focus is on day to day like most stps but i just focus on the moment rather for the moment like types do . also , i notice that type' s have this just do it approach in what they do . naturally , i can' t really just do anything without contemplating tactical options , proscons , and outcomes . this in turn leads me to decent ni rather than inferior present in types . type over type to start , the biggest factor for me leaning toward type is my seemingly healthy fe . many have commented that my fe is to pronounced to be in the inferior position . reading through the type threads , i' ve noticed that during early years( childhood through high school ), there' s this annoyance that is felt regarding the social plays of those years . for me , i was ambivalent toward it and just accepted it as part of life and even enjoyed it as it was one of the few things that made high school worth it to me . as for people in general , i don' t really have the cynicism that i' ve observed with type . i' ve been happy go lucky through my life , not critical of anything in particular . on another note , i never had any goals career wise , even up to college( still don' t ). the only rough outline of what i really want to do is to do something in creating( car focused ) ."

istp,"i saw this topic in the type forum , i thought it was a good one . what' s your view on casual sex ? what' s your view on intimate sex ? can you only see sex on a physicalpleasurable scale , or only an emotionalbonding scale , or both ? how old are you and how many partners have you had intercourse with?"
entj,"hi type' s , i' ve begun talking with someone who is an type . at first , she said she is an type , but when i mentioned casually that i never met an type before , she followed up later saying she went back to look at her records and is actually an type . i gave her my number and she followed up in good time . she describes herself to me as an outgoing introvert and , as i have a very good friend who is an type , i know how that is . in addition , i know how the communicate when i feel like it happens and how long bouts of silenceno texts backetc are just how this type works . contrary to how i' ve connected with others in the past , with long deep conversations , this is more her wanting to arrange dates to meet up and get to know each other . it' s nice . she' s quite a bit younger than i am . do you have any fav spots around town ? she asked .( no. )she said she would show me around town , which i appreciate since i don' t really know much of the area . she asked me what church i go to !very impressed by that question alone . she will be going on a trip for a week beginning this weekend , but is interested in going to a brewery with me when she gets backif you can wait that long !i told her in response , no rush . she' s been moving things forward , while i sit back and say sure , whatever works . it' s nice . i will browse these forums , but if anyone is inspired to give some tips on dating an type , please let me know . i have some good reference from my friend . type are peoplemanagers who don' t like having their emotions pulled out of them . i love to pull emotions out of people  ! i know how awkward an type gets when someone is compelling them to reveal emotion . i found out , with my type friend( male )that his mom was an fe dominant who abused him emotionally in ways that suppressed his fi so he became an type . so , i know how it' s hard for my friend to handle emotional stuff . he' s much more interested in people , what they can do for him , and so on . i know she' s interested in a long term relationshipmarriage . i know i am only an option in the mind of an type . i am only interested in a long term relationship that leads to marriage as well . her faith is very important to her , which is refreshing to talk to someone who shares that . i think i get along well with types , and somehow i fit in their mind as a valuable friend . romance ? i ' m not so sure . i' ve become much more whatever happens , happens in the past year , not worrying about the outcome of relationships , and it' s done wonders for me . i think that is the attitude necessary for many different types , however i still want intensity and connection i just deny myself . anyway . if you have some tips for how i should approach things , i' d appreciate the input . i perform subtle things to coax out emotions from people i find myself brought to tears almost daily for different reasons( today was a conversation during a meeting with my pastor about some disagreement inside the church ), and that usually comes from eliciting emotion off others , and then i take it and let it swell and overflow . inferior fi means the type will be very weirded out if i do that . so my thinking is to be very friendly and casual and lighthearted and to live in the moment doing whatever as if i ' m not thinking about the next step , letting her direct things( even though in reality i ' m cranking out a thousand contingencies per second regarding all the different possibilities of all interactions ), while ignoring my desire to dig deep immediately , letting her open up as she feels comfortable . sound good?"
esfj,so an type male wants to ask an type out but he' s a bit shy and afraid he won' t be able to get a word in edgewise . is there something i can tell him to help him have a chance ? any additional information about what you appreciateenjoy from a man in a relationship would also be greatly appreciated.
estp,"hey guys !so i ' m coming here because i ' m having a relationship issue and i need help !so , i am ayear old type female dating ayear old type male . we have been together for a little over a year , and there is no doubt that i love him . i would do anything for him , but i ' m afraid that i may end up prolonging a relationship when i shouldn' t just because i believe in trying my hardest . so here' s the situation my partner and i have both always leaned more on the aggressive side( high type' s ). after huge arguments in the beginning of our relationship , we both learned to calm down and communicate better . also in the beginning of the relationship , i had huge jealousy issues . if i even thought he was looking at a girl , i would flip out . but i worked on that and left it behind me . so neither of us have been perfect , but we worked on ourselves a lot for each other . we have great chemistry and are best friends . however , lately my boyfriend will freak out on me for essentially nothing . for example , he claimed that i liked too many pictures of good looking guys on instagram( i never like shirtless pictures or anything inappropriate i like even more pictures of girls and he likes just as many pictures of other women ). he proceeded to call me thirsty and throw a huge fit with me . he has been insecure about his looks lately , so i thought maybe that' s why he was acting like that . but in another example , i made a comment about how a black basketball player with big hair was blocking the other players with his hair . he claimed that i didn' t make the same remark about the last white basketball player who had a huge mohawk.he proceeded to act childishly and refuse to cuddle me that night . we are both black , but before him i only dated white guys so i figured that' s where his sensitivity came from . today is taking the cake for me . his close friend is visiting from out of town , and we visited him last night . we went to visit him again today . usually i am very bad with directions , but this time i happened to remember where he lived . my boyfriend acted rudely to me all day because i remembered how to get to his friends house , as if it implied something shady about me . i have tried to be understanding of his insecurities , because i can be insecure at times as well . and i also know that he is dealing with a lot at home . but i feel like he fabricates arguments , and i ' m not sure if it is because he has issues he needs to work on , or he doesn' t want this relationship anymore . i have never cheated on him , and i am a good girlfriend to him . i don' t think he has any reason to act so crazy with me . should i continue to be patient with him ? or are these signs of a bad relationship ? also , outside of this problem he is great !i have no other complaints about him except for this issue . are any types able to relate to him and explain his actions to me?"
isfj,"types are pretty good at reading people , right ? so if someone they had feelings for( feelings they felt they couldn' t act on )confessionstyle subtly hinted at having feelings for them for some two years , which of the following is more likely ? a )they are oblivious to the message of the shaky person in front of them and take the subtle words at face value . b )unable to reciprocate , choose to feign ignorance so as not to embarrass the speaker . asking for a friend"
enfp,"typically when i meet types , there' s some sort of connection that makes me want to know them more , regardless of whether i know they' re an type . but as i get to know them better , i also get into disagreements with them a lot .( then after this argument phase , we become really good friends. )it' s not like i ' m trying to seek out arguments either. . i find it weird . i love types to death and i know they enjoy my company too , but why do we seem to know exactly what ticks them off and vice versa ? i don' t want to argue with them anymore . i don' t understand why this is happening."
intj,is an type expressing verbally their appreciation of you a common occurrence or is this a rarity ? for example an type saying i appreciate your confidence.

entp,"hey , everybody !i have an type friend and it always seems that he is always getting into troubleawkward positionsbad luck . for example , if a bird had to poop on one person in our group , it would be the type . if someone had to accidentally run into an old lady and knock her over , it would be the type . is this just this one person , or does it overflow into all type' s at some level ? note he always takes these situations in stride , and with humor . just wondering."

infj,"hi everyone . i used to post on here a long time ago . great that the place is still around . even the poem thread still exists . cool . i have cptsd . i go to therapy , i ' m doing the work , and i am getting better . a lot . and have , for awhile . recently i wanted to look up an type personality profile again , because of a conversation i was having with someone about the decade of recovery work i had been doing , which started with the myers briggs . i had gotten out of a bad situation , and maybe i just really needed to feel seen at the time , but i remember sobbing reading the type profile for the first time . reading it again , overyears later , i had a very different reaction . it felt like they were describing the coping mechanism of people that experienced prolonged trauma in a situation they cannot escape from . it felt like the personality that is being described is that of unrecognized trauma , because i recognize that person as the traumatized labor of love who didn' t yet know how to deal with all these feelings and experiences he was having , and who didn' t have a context to make sense of them , yet . so , i got curious . i ' m going to post the list of traits of adult children of alcoholics and dysfunctional families , and i ' m wondering if any of you guys resonate with it . the laundry list ? ? traits of an adult child of an alcoholic or dysfunctional family we became isolated and afraid of people and authority figures . we became approval seekers and lost our identity in the process . we are frightened by angry people and any personal criticism . we either become alcoholics , marry them or both , or find another compulsive personality such as a workaholic to fulfill our sick abandonment needs . we live life from the viewpoint of victims and we are attracted by that weakness in our love and friendship relationships . we have an overdeveloped sense of responsibility and it is easier for us to be concerned with others rather than ourselves this enables us not to look too closely at our own faults , etc . we get guilt feelings when we stand up for ourselves instead of giving in to others . we became addicted to excitement . we confuse love and pity and tend to ?love ? people we can ?pity ? and ?rescue. ? we have ?stuffed ? our feelings from our traumatic childhoods and have lost the ability to feel or express our feelings because it hurts so much( denial ). we judge ourselves harshly and have a very low sense of selfesteem . we are dependent personalities who are terrified of abandonment and will do anything to hold on to a relationship in order not to experience painful abandonment feelings , which we received from living with sick people who were never there emotionally for us . alcoholism is a family disease and we became paraalcoholics and took on the characteristics of that disease even though we did not pick up the drink . paraalcoholics are reactors rather than actors . tony a . , "
estp,"hi , i ' m wondering if an type is easy to forget a mistake or a problem ? i mean , is an type they type of person who holds grudge or as time goes by they' ll forget and think that nothing happened ? there was an type guy that' s interested in me( he said it to my friend directly )but after a while i think that i did or said something that made him backed a little bit and now he doesn' t talk to me . he didn' t say anything , he just disappeared but he said to my friend he didn' t want to pursue me again( plus he' s having a conflict with his friend who also likes me so he decided to surrender and let his friend chase me but i don' t like him ). is there any chance that when everything' s settled down a bit , he forget and wants to pursue me again ? i mean me and this type guy only chatted for about a week , he still didn' t know anything about me yet and so do i to him . i think it' s a little too early to drew a conclusion to back of just because of that . what do you think ? any inputs are welcomed thanks."

entj,"i ' m curious how you( xntjs )experience rage . for me , i used to have outbursts quite frequently when i was younger . i would find the most hurtful things to say and have no issues trampling on the feelings of family and friends . now that i ' m older , i spend more time venting rather than actually blowing up in people' s faces . it might be a british thing . but i ' m done with causing actual hurt to people . now , i' ll stand up for myself but more in a these are the facts. . kinda way . i' ve read that types in particular have rage issues . i wonder how true that is?"
isfp,"sometimes i find that type men can be somewhat ambiguous about their sexual preference , therefore never quite being certain if the type men that i ' m talking to are just being affectionate , or if that' s a sign of sexual or romantic interest . i have had suggestive interactions with three type men who claimed that they' re straight , but they often heavily flirty with me in a romantic way that suggests they want more than a platonic friendship . with me being an type who takes relationships quite seriously and practically( i flirt for a reason rather just for fun ), i can find myself being harsh towards them after a while because then it comes across as if i ' m being emotionally and sexually toyed with for their own selfinterest in feeling wantedlovedlikedattractive . this results in them stating that they' re straight and then acting confused as if they didn' t spend the last month heavily flirting with me both in text and in person . i don' t want to make this an type type thing , but rather it' s more the idea that this has been a common pattern that i' ve noticed in straight type men that i have built closer bonds with . i was curious to see if other straight male types have recognized this in themselves , or if they' re aware that sometimes they can be a bit ambiguous in their intentions which can lead to people becoming confused and frustrated by them."

esfj,"okay so i' ve been left out by nearly everyone my whole life . including family members and friends . i remember when i was a kid and kids would come in and hand out party invitations to the entire class except for one person me . even when i considered those people to be my friends . of course , now i realize they weren' t and i hate them . then in high school everybody made fun of me all the time , and now in college people avoid me . no one sits near me in class . every other seat in the class will be filled except for the ones around me . i even annoy my parents just by talking . i hate all these people . i ' m never the most important person in anyone' s life and never have been , even if they are mine . even the girls i have dated didn' t care enough to respond to my texts half the time . it makes me very angry that these people have left me out and i' ve decided that i hate them . i don' t know what' s so wrong with me that people don' t want me at their parties , to sit near me , or even talk to me . this is why i want to ruin everything for them."
enfj,"what do you think of the following statement ? since types are ultimately unsure of the soundness of their own logic( ti ), they may unwittingly try to convince themselves through the act of convincing others . the more people they can convince that an idea is sound( fe ), the more confident they hope to feel about its veracity( ti )have you done this ? still doing it ? are you unsure of the correctness of your own logic ? does it bother you a lot ? and a scenario have you ever learned something through studyti activity( like discovering something in a documentary ), that happened to be a minority opinionbelief that you could not get approved by your familyfriends . and what did you do ? did you stick to your newfound belief or did you forget about it ? please answer one or more questions or just say something else about it."

intj,"hello types !in this group interview with all types that have extroverted sensing , introverted feeling , extroverted thinking , and introverted intuition in their function stack , we discussed introverted feeling , extroverted thinking , introverted intuition , and extroverted sensing . julien( type ), abby( type ), alan( type ), and josh( type )each shared how each of them experience their functions based on their specific personality type . we started our group interview with everyone discussing their ni followed by their se . this was then followed by everyone' s te and finally ended with fi . we purposely saved fi for last because i knew it would open a can of worms and it most certainly did . the discussion had a heavy turn as we discussed life' s meaning , depression , and how very different those with masculine fi are from those who have feminine fi . it was also interesting how the feeling of unhappiness was greater in those who had ni as a saviour versus lead se . julien' s phone died and so he disappeared from the interviewin . but it was definitely interesting to see the different dynamics and how type and type tend to envy each other' s abilities while the type and type shared their annoyances with insects . watch this interview here"
estp,"hello types !in this interview , i got a chance to talk to lauren about what it' s like to be an type seti cps ( b )ff . lauren talked about ni being her biggest problem when it comes to her type . understanding and using ni is a huge challenge for her and planning is definitely something that doesn' t come naturally for her . she also talks about being an exxp and obsessed with gathering things and having no breaks when it comes to gathering the new . lauren seems very balanced with self and tribe . she also talked about having things problems , especially dealing with health issues . she also talked about loving the ixxjs doing the planning and control for her which she really appreciates . lauren is also blast last so i do think she personally knows how to use many of her animals but explaining how she experiences them is a challenge . watch this video here"
isfj,"hey types , i wondered if there is someone who has similar experiences as i have just simply because we have the same personality type . i' ve been reading many posts by types here and am amazed at how similar my experiences are to theirs . last night , my friends , who are extraverts , and i were having some fun since we' re in college and this semester is almost over . even though , i got pretty tired by putting so much energy by socializing with them for one whole day but i was having fun . one friend of mine is so into personality types since i told him about the differences between introverts and extraverts , that there arepersonalities , and all interesting stuff . he found a demographic on the personalitypage website on each personality type and told us about the intelligence level according to personality type listed from highest to lowest . all of their personality types were listed higher than mine and all of them looked at me like i ' m stupid . i didn' t make a comment on that because i felt judged by them , and i didn' t really care about this demographic and thought it was pointless . it doesn' t prove our achievements because we can be successful no matter what type we have . another friend was trying to explain to me what was on the website and tried to show me the demographic . i repeatedly told him that i can read and will read it later . i just wanted to talk about something else but they were so obsessed about this demographic as they felt so superior , regardless of how often they ask me what the vocabulary words and the sentences mean and i could answer all of them . i ' m known as a sensitive person , and i got so upset and hurt that i became withdrawal and just wanted them to leave . around an hour later , they finally got a hint that i wasn' t interested in their talk anymore . throughout my life , i' ve been told that i ' m very intelligent . but i ' m still struggling with my selfesteem and used to believe that i was stupid because of the way other people treated me for years . things have been improving for me but it takes time . so , does my reaction to this situation make sense ? if you were put in this situation , how would you respond to it?"

infp,"to my fellow types what is your relationship with social media ? i' ve decided to delete all my accounts , save for here if it counts as social media but whatever( you can' t delete it anyway soo. )personally i find it distracting and brings flashbacks to when i was a stupid attention seeking scamp commenting weird remarks on other' s posts for attention and without a second thought . it also harbors a lot of the emotions i' ve felt in the form of stories and posts( archived as well ). i also find it absolutely frustrating because a )i do not feel fulfilled by it at all , as a burgeoning artist and writer it is fruitless . sure i ' m not remarkable at what i do whatsoever( i am still learning after all ), but i find that hardly anyone notices what work i used to post despite the number of hashtags and stories and even asking people to promote it through their accounts just the same . i find myself constantly swiping down on and on reloading the page hoping a notification pops up but nothing . it just leaves me with a bad headache . b )it' s already clear to me that no one texts me , so why do i keep logging back in everyminutes as if someone will ? and when i try to stay clear , as if succumbing to a withdrawal symptom i am once again forced to sustain my social media addiction , only to see not a single red dot up the heart or the dm icon.i attribute that to my previous habitual use as mentioned above . it is more or less a hollow habit . c )i twist myself into a pretzel when i submit to the urge to post stories with cryptic messages aimed towards people who wronged me and old memories that surface thinking i can vent it out when i know damn well that isn' t the case . made worse by the fact that nobody replies to them , asking me the story behind it , if i ' m alright and i need someone to talk to.these are mindgames because that is the last thing i need , and besides it won' t happen anyway . my actions are as if they are dictated by a soul completely different from mine , a strange paradox . there are other ways to establish my career that help me to work hard towards my goals , such as a website , as well as a blog , publishing to various magazines and the like . i feel that for the betterment of my mental health , and also since i am hardly a social person , this might be the way to go . but i feel as though something is missing , as if my decision is not valid for some reason . after much thought i realized , that i don' t really have anything to lose nor will anything change with my leaving . then why am i still hesitant ? i' d like to know your experiences . do note that i am not asking for a solution , but for something to evaluate my situation with so i can make my own decision . i ' m being as careful as i could with this."

enfp,"matching most type profile descriptions , i identify myself as an individual with some extremely unrelated skills and interests , from the creative( music , web artdesign )to the encyclopedic( history , geography ). i introduced myself already as a business and social sciences student at university level with plenty of psychology courses , and each of the interestsskills i mentioned here share the same importance and value in my perceptionsome of them having started many years even before i finished middle school !while studying , i ran a small business in the travel sector and have founded several nonprofit projects in the field of environmental sustainability . in each of these projects and business , i always used my full range of nonspecialized skills , however. . there' s one thing that i am very sure about even though i enjoy entrepreneurial activities , i don' t see doing business as my ultimate professional identity , but rather as a skill to be able to promote something i am good at . i think the main problem i would feel in being just a businessmanselfemployed all my life would be the lack of sophistication and intellectual challenge . holding everything else equal to the type standard , i value sophistication a lot . two realistic career paths i have given serious consideration during my time at university , but rejected includehuman resources development , training , recruiting , etc .international affairs , diplomacy( facilitating conflict resolution between countries )one option that still seems viable isacademic researcherprofessor( research and teach in the different fields i am interested in , and eventually also consult whoever needs expertise in such fields )among the less realistic ones i still haveexploration or emergency pilotorchestra conductor less realistic simply because unless i become a millionaire( not possible with small business ), i would not be able to fund the training for those careers  ! yet , i have a considerable amount of basicamateur experience even in these two fields( have written actual orchestra music for noncommercial projects , and have very deep interest in aviation ). to sum up as you can see , i have many interests in often unrelated areas , and to be successful in either of them i would need to train and invest a considerable amount of time . type advice articles around the web seem to suggest finding a way to include all interests . how is this realistically possible in my case ? thank you for reading . maybe you have some ideas for me?"
istj,"hello fellas !i am an type girl who is having a crush with an type guy . honestly , we met on a dating site like six months ago . i stumbled upon his profile , read it , and i could see that he is a very kind man and that he is just different from the other men i had dated previously . so , i initiated the contact with him and he responded it warmly . he lives in europe , while i live in asia . we exchanged messages daily , it started out as a rather short messages but then as we communicated furthermore , we started to exchange longer messages . we have quite a lot of things in common , he even told me that he had ancestors who came from my country and it only makes our messaging activity more exciting . i took it as a good sign when he could told me about some things that are considered as very personal or even spilled some of his secrets to me , despite he confessed that he is naturally very shy when it comes to interacting with strangers , especially girls . after almost four months messaging through dating site , i asked him for his social medias , but it turned out that he doesn' t use any , so he suggested me to contact him via email and he also gave me a link to his blog . since the second month we met , i actually have waited for him to ask me first about my social media or number etc but since i know that he is an type , so i think he doesn' t want to rush things and just go with the flow i was just trying to follow his rules . but after waiting for another two months , he doesn' t seem to have such initiative , so i think i have to make a move first . we keep exchanging messages , but less frequently as our messages size are getting bigger and bigger so it took a considerable amount of time to compose a reply . we actually talk about lots of serious things in our conversations . at one point , he confessed that it was scary to see how we both have a lot of same characters , visions , dreams in the future . we have both tell our parents about each other . my parents are quite happy about him and on the other side he also said that his parents are also positive towards me , even his dad is really excited about me . he also shyly told me that he never had a great time talking with a girl( he never had a girlfriend before ). we were also mutually asking each other about relationships of course , like the criteria of our future spouse , the definition of ideal relationship for us , cultural difference in relationship , gender roles( he is naturally very traditional about it but he said that he' s okay with a girl taking initiative to start a relationship )and that he is a very serious person when it comes to relationship . of course there are some disagreement and differences in our views , but i don' t see it as fundamental though . he also gave an important point that when he find someone who is serious with him , he' s going to be all out for her but when someone is not serious with him , he will instantly give up . i told him i have serious plan to move to his country( not because of him , i have settled this plan long ago )and he was very excited about it . i also planned a vacation to europe this winter to visit my family members who live in the same country as him and we have agreed that we should arrange a meetup while i am there . he even invited me to spend a day along with his family together . then one day he expressed his intention to spent his summer vacation to volunteer in the states for three weeks . we still got along very well , and he sent some updates on his preparations and just minutes before he fled , he messaged me to let me know that he was ready for an adventure . during his time there , he rarely communicate with me , maybe justmessages in three weeks . but i don' t think it matters because later he told me that the internet connection was really bad at his place . after he got home , he sent me a message telling he had a great time there and he met some great people there , including a girl that he said is quite close and compatible in terms of personality with him and that they keep in touch through whatsapp . we exchanged other two emails but i sense something different about him in those messages , he usually seem to be a detailed person and he will provide comprehensive answers on my questions , but i don' t see it anymore in his three latest messages . he just seemed to be very distant . he also told me that he was never really thinking about having a girlfriend until recently . i am not sure what did he mean with recently , is itmonths ago ,months ago , or justmonth ago . just recently( finally )he asked me to do a skype with him . i gladly accepted this and we managed to do it properly , having a good time together for almost two hours . we laughed quite a lot during our conversation . then the following week we did anotherhourish skype session an it was just good . we also agreed to have skype again soon . i was just waiting for him to initiate some talks about relationship during the skype but nothing serious came out of him . we just had conversations about our daily life , family , my plan to go to his country , traveling , and such things . he didn' t mention even a single thing about our intention to arrange a meetup when i am in europe . then , since i thought he is an amazing person to chat with and it seemed like we have known each other quite long , we even had seen each other , although in digital manner . i asked him whether it is okay for me to add his number( which is provided in his skype profile )and communicate with him via instant messages instead . but he hasn' t sent a reply to it and it' s been like a week since i sent the message , i knew he had read the message but somehow i haven' t seen any reply since.sad he tend to delay replying to short message though , but usually withindays , i already got a reply from him . i admit that as an type girl and hsp , i tend to over analyze things . and these are the questions that bother me a lot all this time)do you guys think that he is actually not very much interested in me ? or in other words , that he is just trying to be polite around me all this time ? for me , with him calling me as his little ones , me having a special personality , asking if my parents are okay that i am being close with him , what my parents think about him , caring about my health and always reminds me to get enough rest , etc . honestly i have a little higher expectation on him . i think he might like me( or is it just my hunch ? )but later he reminds me that i should tell him when he is romanticizing things because he feel he is not that experienced dealing with girls . that was confusing to me . all this time i tried to be sensible and rational that i shouldn' t hope too high about our future , although i admit it' s hard , because i think i just like him a lot already .)is it a typical thing for type( guys )to delay replying to short messages ? ok , i know he was just busy with his internship and all , but i was just asking for a yesno question , and it took days to reply to it ? just nonsense for me .)should i just wait for him first to confess if he loves me( or not )? or maybe at some point it is better that i express my feelings for him just right away before he does ? crying)i am in doubt whether i should continue to wait for him any longer if i can' t really see that we have prospect in the future . it was confusing when he suddenly sent mixed signals about me lately . of course i am just willing to wait for him if he doesn' t behave strangely like what he did recently . i don' t know if it' s just my assumption or is that a sign that he starts to feel disinterested about me ? or that he needs a little more time to process all information he got and decide whether he want to be serious with me or not later ? should i just wait patiently until i meet him in person before taking a decision ? frustrating hopefully anyone here especially type guys can help me to figure this out . any insights and suggestions would be very much appreciated thank you for reading ,"

intp,"why do the intuitive think like this ? sensitives live in the moment and look for practical and concrete solutions to problems . but the intuitive see the bigger picture as if they were in a bird' s eye view . they think abstractly and theoretically and they think on a meta level . often the ideas of the sensitive appear to them as pointless , because the intuitive , in contrast to the sensitive , see where the path leads . some people have very strong intuitions and are at a much higher meta level that is not understood by most people who see them as visionaries , but also as crazy people . that' s why i ' m going to tell you how you can imagine the life of a few silicon valley ceos silicon valley ceos recognize the insignificance of their companies and instead deal with immortality a month ago i watched the videos on bryan johnson' s youtube channel . he' s a typical silicon valley ceo . but then he changed his life completely and now he spends most of the day with sports , nutrition and his selfoptimization . because he' s trying to become immortal and get the body back from an yearold . he no longer takes much time for his company , concentrating only on biotechnology . there is also a trend among the other ceos in silicon valley to research selfoptimization . e.g . jeff bezos founds the company altos labs , they work on biotechnology and immortality . or elon musk founds the company neuralink , which aims to develop an interface between the brain and the computer . videos of bryan johnson' s private life can be seen on his youtube channel . when he says that being an entrepreneur and being rich is no longer fulfilling for him , you might think that having a business is just smoke and mirrors . and that it' s the wrong goal and at a certain point you ask yourself what the point of having a company is . even though bryan johnson and the rest of silicon valley' s ceos are entrepreneurs , they' re just regular people at home or at the gym . four confident super technologies that turn humans into gods one can guess that they are focused on exactlysuper technologies in the near future that futurologist noah harari describes in his books the nanobots , genetic engineering , braincomputer interface and the ai . harari warns that transhuman beings could emerge in the future , replacing humans as the crown of creation . the special thing about thetechnologies is that you can use them to optimize your brain . you can also get new insights through e.g . studying or new experiences . but if you optimize your brain with one of the technologies , it has a much larger impact . with this one could expand one' s awareness that one gets a new horizon for experiences . what do you do with your time when you' re immortal ? immortality is not an end in itself , but one lives longer so that one can experience more . if you live longer , you have a chance to experience the great technologies in the future that you can use to optimize yourself . therefore immortality also comes down to the optimization of the brain . all people who have the potential to become age researchers should do so from this it can be concluded that the researchers from the companies developing thetechnologies have the ultimate profession and meaningful work . and if you have the skills to advance the technologies , you should work for a company like that . this means that starting a startup and being a ceo doesn' t have to be an incentive . because many people with potential go to silicon valley and try to make the world a better place there . you can help the transhumanism companies with larger or smaller steps . even if you don' t benefit from the work yourself , users can in the future . if you do research in the wrong field , you have a wasted researcher' s life another problem is that you have to speculate when you decide on a research area . it may be that one or more technologies don' t work and that nanobots or braincomputer interfaces. . aren' t possible . noah harari also mentions this in his bookdeus . there is probably only one technology that will make a breakthrough in the near future . it is then either the result of the physicists or biologists( roughly classified ). you' re either on the winning or losing side , a real dilemma . which technology could have a breakthrough first ? i ' m not an expert on thetechniques , i chose biology as a main subject in high school in germany . how can i find out which technology is the most promising , who can advise me ? i' ll try it anyway nanobots in my opinion , nanotechnology is not very advanced . it is possible to bring substances to certain parts of the body through the blood system or to let them swim through the eye . but they will probably not be able to intervene in the cell metabolism of individual cells any time soon . brain computer interfaces there are several problems with brain computer interfaces that need to be overcome . one problem is that the cables have to grow together with the neurons . and for it to be an effective improvement , different neurons need to be activated or read in a pattern , so that you can move a prosthesis or mentally pull up a website on the internet is even further in the future . ai it could be a long time before artificial intelligence overtakes humans . genetic engineering the best method for genome editing is of course crisprcas . a difficult problem is that more data is needed on which gene is responsible for which trait . it can be used to determine the dna of a zygote , but changing the dna of an adult human is even more difficult because the genes that are to be incorporated must first be inserted into the nuclei of every cell in the body . rejuvenation is perhaps the better technique after all . cellular reprogramming cellular reprogramming is one promising method , which is being researched in altos labs , among others , to stop or reverse the human aging process . top researcher juan carlos izpisua belmonte and nobel laureate shinya yamanaka , who invented this method , also work there . jeff bezos is investing billions into the company , so he really has high hopes for the method and thinks it' s a hot lead . in cellular reprogramming , a person' s cells are turned back into stem cells , which then turn back into tissue cells be specialized . this rejuvenates the cells . shinya yamanaka has already done the experiment on mice , it has indeed been rejuvenated , but tumors have also formed , which is a problem that needs to be solved . immortality could be anotheryears away , or we' re close to a breakthrough . in summary , i would bet on cellular reprogramming . but like i said , i ' m not an expert . which course is the best ? if you want to do research on cellular reprogramming , the obvious thing to do is get hired at altos labs . but which tasks are important there ? for example , biotechnologists are needed there to build devices that can be used to observe the processes in cells . and you need biochemists who know how which substances affect the cells . you also need programmers and much more . which course is the right one molecular medicine , biomedicine , biochemistry or biotechnology ? they are all very similar . but likely , in the end , the molecular madizen has the crucial hypothesis that makes cellular reprogramming work . like juan carlos izpisua belmonte and shinya yamanaka , who developed the method significantly , who work with molecular medicine . that' s why i think the molecular medicine course makes the most sense . conclusion one can doubt whether it is really the right goal to be an entrepreneur and a millionaire . looking at it from the meta level , you might think it' s better to work on selfimprovement like bryan johnson . preferably as a molecular medicine scientist at altos labs . perhaps bryan johnson and jeff bezos regret that they don' t have the expertise to work at altos labs and have to settle for only small contributions through donations and project blueprint."
esfp,"ryuji mbti typepersonambti types ryuji typepersonamyersbriggs types ryuji is a type from persona, he' s a se dom and fi aux user , he is not a type , not even close . i saw that mistype for him once and i completely disagree , ryuji acts nothing like a type and is definitely a type and fi user . crap , i hear footsteps comin '!lots of' em !ryuji se coming out in this scene as a dom se user and type character . ryuji is a type character that' s always relying on his senses , notices details , and lives being fully in the moment . he' s also very impulsive and spontaneous in the game and very hotheaded too . he asks why does everything have to be so complicated to morgana and struggles a bit to understand the concept morgana is talking about at first . he' s bad at grasping concepts and ideas when morgana explains them like with trying to explain how kamoshida' s palace works . of course theres plenty of intelligent types out there but ryuji' s case even if he can be smart too in the game he' s just bad at grasping concepts immediately . he lives by his morals and values strongly and cares a lot about authenticity showing his clear aux fi . morgana tells him to not be so angry and emotional and to calm down in the kamoshida palace when there talking . ryuji feels strongly and emotionally the entire kamoshida scene before his persona transformation . his fi is stirred and pushed hard in this scene as he speaks about his dark past on the track team with him . his aux fi is driven and he even gets roasted for being too emotional again by kamoshida again here in this scene , his emotions are shot and pushed to his limits . his fi is pushed so much as he says all the things he' s emotionally angry about at kamoshida in this scene and it drives him with his strong emotions and fi moments in this scene to his ultimate persona transformation , captain kidd . things get badass and he can joker get up and start the fight and go in as the cool rock music plays . ryuji at times cares about efficiency with his te tertiary , he wants to usually hurry up and get things done and is a goal oriented person even if his te is usually weak and he' s laid back and bad at school and getting things done most the time . his te efficiency is usually focused on things he' s interested in doing like stopping a bad guy or corrupt adult or going to something fun with the group as well . he hates studying and struggles with it and procrastinates like ann who is type in her case . ryuji usually jumps into things without thinking and is not very future oriented and not the best planner . people roast him a lot and say he' s dumb and he even admits it himself once , but he has plenty of smart moments in the game too like with speculating things shido might do and so on and some insightful things he said in the game at different moments . he had an amazing moment when he saved the party by running and getting the life boat even with a bad leg in shido' s palace . his friends thought he was dead but in the end he made it out of the explosion somehow . he' s always a great best friend and he takes responsibility for his actions , especially in the royal maruki content and apology he gave , all the cast apologized but ryujis was the most genuine of them all . ryuji is usually used for comic relief and thinks a lot things of overcomplicated and struggles to get concepts usually but despite this he' s an amazing character and a amazing best friend to joker and has a heart of gold and amazing morality in the game and it just a great person in general . he' s one of my favorite type characters as of late , he' s up there with kuwabara from yu yu hakusho and i love him and his character in the personagame . thanks for reading."

istp,"this goes out to the type christians on this forum . i accepted christ at ageand from the age ofto the present , i' ve been all over the place with christianity . i' d go into detail , but i ' m on my phone.if you need the details , i' ll hop online later and give them . i' ve reached a point now , where i truly desire to live according to god' s word . i believe jesus is the only way i can be saved and i accept him into my heart . my problem lies in that , the deeper i think about christianity , the more i wonder if my belief is true . christians always ask the question , if you were to die tonight , are yousure you' d go to heaven ? and when i think about it , i can' t even picture heaven . i can' t see myself standing face to face with jesus or standing before god in judgement . heck , i can' t even see myself dying . i live so much in the moment , it' s hard for me to grasp any past or future . and it' s not like i believe anything else , like evolution , the big bang etc . i just can' t honestly say i can grasp the conceptwrap my mind around god being out there watching me right , now . so i ' m stuck between belief and( doubt ? ) .it' s really bothering me because i want to have a genuine belief , but i can' t reason it into existence and i don' t even know if the belief i have is false to begin with . also , when i get really involved with church , i almost feel like i ' m in a dream or something . like none of this is real and i ' m just gonna wake up and go back to a normal life where all i ' m concerned about is mechanics , thrill seeking and the thought of death never occurs to me . it' s weird . the more i think , the more confused i become . i tried talking to the college pastor at my church and he tried to help me , but he drew some blanks because my , thoughts were so deep i guess he didn' t really look that deep into the topic before . also the bible preaches , to keep your focus things of heaven , not on things of the earth . and it preaches to follow it' s scripture , but he more i focus on heaven and following scripture , i can' t seem to function in day to day life anymore and i feel bogged down by rules and regulations . i know( from what i' ve read and my own experience )we type' s tend to have trouble believing in things we can' t see and looking into the future . how did you overcome this struggle and accept christianity as a reality ? or did you even have this struggle?"

intp,"i had a relationship with someone who claimed to be an type , and who attributed much of his behavior to being one , but i fear he was a narcissist instead . i want to highlight that i always thought types were nice people , i knew many along my life and they always were cool people to be with open minded , logical( in ways i am not ), interested on how stuff works.mentally stimulating . but my ex.eh , let' s begin . this is going to be a super long post , but i have realized only some weeks ago that he might have been a total emotional abuser , and i didn' t have seen it coming at all . my questions , after you read my very long explanation , will be a ) is this behavior normal in types or not ? b ) if it is , can you explain me why ? i just want to understand . i don' t plan in going back to this person at all , am happy now , but i want to know for my own psychological narrative if he abused me or if it was just that we were not compatible at all . i met my ex through tinder . this is not a good signal , maybe , or even a place where you would meet an type ? i don' t know . that was the first reason why i contacted him i liked types from before , and he was attractive , hehehe . let' s say first that i had sexual problems when we met .( dyspareunia and virginity , and some other stuff xd but that' s not the scope of this post , anyway( although i don' t really mind speaking about them now ). at first he seemed to be very in love with me , he wrote me every day , he was very sweet , deep , profound , connected with me , we talked about art , even about my mental illness( i am in the schizo spectrum ). he said he was reading stuff about the spectrum to understand me better . but.some things were odd . and they turned odder with time . if i had to describe it in a few words , i would say he emotionally neglected me and gaslighted me . although the phrase i like to use is that for him , i was nothing more than a prop . i was someone that made him feel good , loved , desired , but when his need for me was over , he said he needed space and retreated back into his shell . he always did this , even when we had sex . he stayed with me in bed , but he often fell asleep and didn' t listen to what i told him . i am not saying he had to listen if he didn' t feel like , but communication in general is something he wasn' t good at . i think he didn' t even try . for him it was himself all the time . hence my question about narcissism . having said this , he was incredibly extroverted for an type . by extroverted i mean he had many friends he met , and liked hard partying . but i have the feeling behind this , there was this need for distance in everything he did . i don' t know even if he had many friends or not , because he never spoke about his past life , the things that shaped him , his exes , more than as a side note . i don' t even know the name of most of his friends . let alone his exes . i know well he disguised all of these behaviors as independence and freedom , but i have the feeling those were a mask for something darker . he even chatted to girls he had in his phone that he knew from tinder , which irked me a lot when we were together . he said i was being possessive and unreasonably jealous because those were only friends , not giving me many more explanations about it . he seemed to be absentminded to me , and he said he did not answer my messages because he was busy , but when we met he was always texting someone in the phone . busy when ? he didn' t like attachments or emotional responsibility i remember i had sexual problems and he said he wanted an open relationship . i am not said he would have needed to say yes to my problems , but if he felt unable , it was more honest leaving me , and i would have accepted it . i left him because of this , and all the times we came back( because we broke up and fought frequently )it was when he took the next step in our relationship , because he was always frightened to take it , despite the fact we had been dating foryears . he even told me , when i was dating another guy and we slept together once , that he wanted it to carry on , the cheating , because the whole situation turned him on . maybe i am being an overly ethical type now but i think it' s a bit sick to put yourself first that way , and i was suffering with the whole situation too . i think i felt thankful that he put up with me , because i thought myself so broken in so many aspects . i can' t say the relationship was entirely bad at first , and was good in some moments . but after i overcame my sexual problems , things seemed to change almost forever . we barely met only to have sex , and there was a time he was stressed with work , so he left me . he left me because he couldn' t put up with it . i was angry and heartbroken . when it was over , he wanted to come back no strings attached , slowly . the other part of his behavior that strikes the most as purely narcissistic to me is his manipulation and gaslighting . like i say , he was very silent , sometimes i would talk to him , even about important stuff , and he would say or do nothing . when we fought , he usually left for hours because he needed to think . it irked me a little , but i always understood . he never did stuff i wanted to do , for example watching a movie or sometimes even paying attention to the music i sent him . when i remarked to him he didn' t , i felt super guilty , but i felt certainly not heard . he always said i did listen or i did listen to x( any other song i had sent him ). i don' t know , it was weird . i think in a couple effort must be done . not as a sacrifice , but.you can' t expect things to be a one way street . it' s not . we never did stuff i wanted , or i felt heard , and this went on stronger until i couldn' t take it anymore( along with other stuff )and i broke up with him . this takes me to the sexual side , which entails two aspects i want to talk about domination and infidelity . i won' t tell you how he was sexually , with many details , because i think it' s not your business , but he was dominating . okay . but sometimes his dom side went a bit too far , because i felt commanded and i felt in fear of saying anything . i felt in fear , in general , not only in bed . i feared his silence , his seriousness , his brick wall . also sometimes i did not want to have sex and he pushed me to . i said no , but it didn' t matter . i had to give up . also , my orgasm was secundary to him , it seemed . as long as he was satisfied( specially towards the end of the relationship ), it was fine . infidelity really was for me the last straw . i am not sure he was unfaithful , but there is a high chance he was , even if it hurt me lots to think about it when we were together . like i said , he talked to girls from tinder . in fact , i find i can' t really speak with certainty about many things because i don' t know him . i knew nothing about him . he always hid under this i need my space thing . there was a girl he talked to a lot , in the time when he was stressed about work and then left me . when we came back , i said , i want to speak about this issue , because the same day we went back together , i saw her talking to her on the phone( no , i don' t nose into his phone , i would never , but he texted her in front of my face , although i was supposed not to look and not know about it , as he told me ). i asked him , who are all these tinder girls you chat to . he said , when i was feeling lonely i relyed a lot on tinder to feel less lonely and chat . strange , but i accepted it . anyway , he kind of skirted the question , which made me feel hurt and i began to cry , and he made me feel like i was the one abusing him , he went all angry and serious at me , and i felt so sorry , i did anything for him to feel good . i asked him even on the phone( text conversation )about these issues , and he always answered monosyllabically , had you any affair while we were together ? you can tell me , i won' t get angry no . who are these girls from tinder ? are they exes and friends ? yes . however , he did tell me that the one he talked to the most , was a girl he had an affair with but now they were friends . they were chatting all the time though , and met in her house , often , and everytime they met , he messaged me very sweetly . also , once he denied having talked to her during one of our trips when i knew he did . i felt gaslighted and even dissociated for the night , but i wanted to believe him , not myself . that was the beginning of destruction . since i knew that this issue was getting at my nerves to some point , i told him . hey , why don' t you introduce me to this girl , i want to let this thing go . and he told me( he , the perfect feminist , he claimed to be )that she was a feminist( ! )who opposed age gap relationships( ! )and would not approve of us . if they are such close friends , why can' t he tell her this ? is this his way to go through life , not talking to his friendslovers ? if so , i think it' s very unhealthy . i think he was using my own disapproval towards certain sectors of feminism to make an excuse that i wouldn' t refuse . but hey , i did . he did a lot of manipulation in this last straw , i asked in a forum about this because i felt crazy , like i was being played but did not want to believe it really , and he said why do you ask that instead of ways you can trust better your boyfriend ? nauseating . he has continued to write to me until not very long ago , but i blocked him for good . sorry for all of this . if you need any detail , i will be glad to give it to you . the doubting is killing me i don' t know if i am the asshole or rather he was . lots of thanks for the help xx"

infp,"hi guys . my name is lanco , and i am a rluaitype . there' s been a topic about rluais in the past , but i don' t feel like necroposting . we know that the description from similar minds of this type is very negative . i think it' s quite accurate , but i don' t take it too seriously. . for a couple of reasons)it ignores positive traits i think i am a good person and i highly value some traits that i have such as being friendly , intelligent , flexible , honest , and openminded . these are all part of rluai , but they weren' t mentioned in the descriptions .)many of the items in the overly negative description are not true of me at all . most of them are true , but many are not .)even for those that are true , they are true only up to a certain extent . for example not good at sports . it' s generally true for me , especially when it comes to team sports such as soccer or basketball , but it hasn' t prevented me from enjoying bicycle rides , roller skating , ice skating , and table tennis . i reached a decent skill in these sports , so that i can play competitively with my friends . i admit though , most of my friends are better than me in table tennis , and i have much more lost games than won , but i always give some decent resistance and try to win and enjoy the game. . also , when it comes to bigi don' t believe too much in types , that you can describe with general descriptions like that. . i am more interested in traits themselves , what causes them , and how they interact between themselves to influence behaviors and life outcomes . i see this personality as a cards i' ve been dealt , but it' s up to me how to play with these cards wisely . as this combination of traits is not often associated with much traditional success and popularity , i think it' s rather important to know ourselves best , so that we know how to put ourselves in situations where we' re more likely to thrive. . to associate with people who will have understanding of our shortcomings and help us overcome them while supporting us in things that we are talented for . and now , here' s the thing. . even similarminds is not all that negative . while the description of our type is terrible , the list of suggested careers is very inspiring . favored careers philosophy professor , novelist , poet , philosopher , bookseller , author , bookstore owner , freelance artist , professor of english , freelance writer , museum curator , playwright , anthropologist , art historian , artist , research scientist , archeologist , egyptologist , researcher , art curator , songwriter , comic book artist , screenwriter , composer , book editor , musician , scholar , historian , theologian , research psychologist , school psychologist , library assistant , part of non profit sector , paleontologist , cartoonist , astronomer , painter , english teacher , theatre technician , illustrator , environmentalist , music therapist , publisher , psychotherapist , history professor , ecologist , psychoanalyst , curator , clinical psychologist , psychologist , video game designer , wildlife biologist , scientist , art teacher , photo journalist , activist , drummer , librarian , cinematographer , music journalist , graphic artist , travel writer , filmmaker , music educator , child psychologist , marine biologist , editor , art director , zoologist , art education , research assistant , botanist , professional college student , forensic anthropologist disfavored careers businessman , business manager , manager , athletic trainer , supervisor , office manager , event coordinator , management consultant , model , sales manager , real estate agent , event planner , sports management , athlete , executive , personal trainer , business owner , marketing manager , office administrator , real estate professional , real estate investor , business administrator , ceo , marketing director , fashion merchandiser , financial manager , salesman , financial planner , public relations specialist , corporate lawyer , sales associate , project manager , admin support , executive assistant as you can see , our favored careers are all very interesting , cool , edgy , etc. . and our disfavored careers are all sort of boring and conventional . we can take pride in our friendliness , openmindedness , integrity , idealism , etc. . and i guess a lot of you are also quite smart in terms of iq as well . we' re more fools than assholes. . and conventionally defined success typically favors assholes over fools . we' re kind of the opposite of assholes . but we can be fools in spite of high iq. . fools more in behavior , than in thinking."
esfp,"i' ve noticed this pattern all the popular girls are pretty blonde types , always dating the sporty type guy . it' s a media thing , but mud sticks . basically , i want to know what types you think we' re most likely to end up with and whether you think the stereotype can be true . personally , types can keep up with me , are often good looking and as sexually charged as i am most of the time xd in britain , all guys play' footy 'unless you' re a rocker . it' s stupid , but you can expect esp guys shirtless and running across a field all day . enough said , guys i tend to lean for are either types , an type who i think is cute or an type . why type ? i don' t know , ask my childhood self . i' ve always leaned to types the most for some reason . i don' t know why , but it seems gospel when i found out about duality , you couldn' t believe how big an ahhah moment i got i don' t go around typing people , i don' t even think about mbti for irl people , only for characters , but i smelt a rat and i was right who do you guys lean to ? and for the thread bombers out there , who do you think we might lean to?"
entj,"unfortunately in my team no discussion culture exists . people are aggressive towards one another and interrupt one another , even offend one another . honestly , it' s like in the kindergarter , worse than that actually . there' s especially one person who dominates each and every discussioninterrupting the others , changing topics , boasting herself on unrelated topics . i now need to present something in front of the team and thinking about getting this kind of feedback gives me the creeps , as i know people will interrupt me , change topics and similar . do you , dear types , know any playful way i could prevent that ? i don' t want to introduce rules at the beginning as it sounds too serious , but maybe i could bring a magic wand or something and introduce the rule that only the person with the wand can talk and the others can' t because if they do , put something here happens . or bring some cookies and give them to people who only said something after being given the floor . i know it' s childish but i hate shouting matches so i want to try something out to prevent it . i want to have a calm , inclusive( i want to hear all team members 'opinions )discussion not a battle where the strongest( unfortunately in case of my team this means the dumbest )wins . could you inspire me?"
istj,"i ' m experiencing a lot of confusion about my type right now . on free online tests i' ve come up as several different types , most often either type or type . lolbig difference !on a type me thread in the type forum , i finally realized that the cognitive functions for type don' t really fiti definitely prefer ne over ni and fi over fe . so.i' ve narrowed it down to either type or type . i lean toward type.even browsing through forums here i feel like i resonate more with type points of view than type ones . but , i ' m pretty close to the line on thinking and feeling , and judging vs perceiving . so , as types , could you all give me your perspective on what you think ?( i ' m posting this in the type forum too ). so here' s me in a( large )nutshell . i am always thinking about other people?s feelings , sometimes to the detriment of my own . i?m very tactful , patient( usually ), and a pretty good listener( if i don' t zone out from boredom with the conversation ). i definitely prefer oneonone , indepth conversations and quality over quantity of relationships . historically , i?ve been shy and quite lacking in social skills , but as i?m learning how to socialize i?m starting to find that i?m quite good at bringing people together , and to my shock have been referred to as a ?people person. ? i tend to be as stubbornly independentminded as concerned about what other people think . i?ve been told that i look like someone that can be trusted , and that i seem to have a keen ability to see myself and others as they really are instead of how they portray themselves to be . historically , i?ve had a tendency to not show my emotions to others , to be quite reserved , serious , and even to have a stoic expression on my face . i do love to laugh , however , and have a dry sense of humor . i have a hard time holding back tears when i ' m upset , and while i' ve begun learning how to manage it better , my temper has been explosive in the past . i' ve also tended to be highly anxious and phobic( which are changing slowly ). i tend to doubt almost everything , especially myself and god . i ' m a very spiritual person , but things happened when i was younger that caused me to question my faith . i ' m hanging on as best i can now while still exploring and searching for answers to my questions . i can' t separate things like truth and love or mercy and justice . i believe that true love encompasses every good thing , including mercy , compassion , justice , morality , truth , forgiveness , selfsacrifice , etc . i value honesty as much as i value other people' s feelings . i can' t stomach darkness or violence , and find it difficult to kill even a mosquito . i don' t believe it' s morally wrong to kill animals , but i do believe it' s not acting in the highest form of love to do so . i tend to constantly feel guilty , even defeated , for not living up to my own high standards , however . i ' m highly sensitive , creative , and enjoy writing . my interest is in understanding and helping people . i didn' t used to feel that way when i was young( shy , social anxiety ), and wanted nothing more than a behindthescenes job . i love interacting with people now , although preferably oneonone . i have a hard time relaxing , given that i have an anxiety disorder( ocd ). i ' m also an obsessive researcher . i ' m not into facts( hate memorization )but i love learning( when i have the selfdiscipline to actually open a book ). psychology , philosophy , sociology , and metaphysics especially interest me . i think and analyze a lot , and can stay in a room for hours just thinking or researching topics of interest online . i' ve been accused of being too logical( by someone who leans the opposite direction ), and have been told by one person( type )that i sound like a thinker as opposed to a feeler . i ' m very much a perfectionist , organized( when i want to be )and tend to be someone who tries to keep the rules to a t . i feel like i have to , but i hate having so many rules for everything in life . i crave independence and being able to makebreak my own rules more than i currently do . i am also detailoriented , and when i get tuned in to a detail will see it everywhere . but i hate dealing with detailsagain , because i ' m a perfectionist . focusing on precision , details , etc . makes me want to scream , even though i ' m good at that . i also have a tendency to be very indecisive( like right now , lol !), and tend to seek advice but like to make the final decision . i hate feeling controlled or rushed , and have issues with procrastination , time management , and project completion . i get frazzled in fastpaced or highpressure environments , especially if someone is watching me . oftentimes , i feel like a ditz . and even at, i still struggle with coming across as naive and childlike to other people . okay , sorry for the essay y ' all !i ' m having an identity crisis right now , so clearly i' ve been pondering this for a while . but any input you could give me would be greatly appreciated."
istp,"hi !i have a really good type friend who has had problems with alcohol foryears( he' snow ). at one point he was even using opioids , and he has pretty much tried every drug that exists , but luckily he has quit everything else except for weed and alcohol( only beer and wine , no hard liquor ). we live in a different countries , so our friendship is mostly online . i met him last summer and because of a pandemic i haven' t been able to meet him this year. . during all this time since i know him i' ve been trying to help him get sober . he has had some shorter and longer sober periods , but it always ends with him getting seriously drunk for a few days in a row . he says that he drinks because he' s bored and being sober is boring . but i think the problem might be deeper than that because it usually is . honestly , i don' t know what to do . and i guess only being able to communicate with him via text messages makes it all even harder . and this probably even isn' t typespecific but more general problem . however , i' ve read that types often have problems with substance abuse , especially alcohol , so maybe there is some typespecific language that i could use to make him change . or how to talk to him to make him want to change ? how to make him value and love himself more ? maybe someone has had a similar experience and can share some insights . maybe it' s my type optimism , but i do believe he can fight the addiction . he is so smart and knowledgable about so many things . we have had plenty of great discussions about various topics . i can see so much potential in him . that' s why i want him to get sober so much . he' s just too good to destroy himself like that . and i wish he would think the same."

enfp,"ok , so i ' m going to put shame to one side and be honest . i ' m a big baby when it comes to getting things done . i give my mind a lot of leeway . i work on a project when i ' m interested , and then move onto the new thing when my interest shifts . to make sure i get key projects done , i find creative ways to be frequently reminded of them and hopefully i get reinspired and work on it some more . i repeat this until things get done . the way i currently get my reminders is through family and friends . i share the important projects i have with people i ' m close to and i ask them to frequently remind me about my project in the most random and silly of ways they can imagine . i also ask them to be as unpredictable as they can with their timing . the less i expect the reminder , and the more silly or random it seems , the more likely i am to be inspired . the pros i actually get shit done . it' s fun . the people in my life who help me have a lot of fun being silly with the reminders . also , i get a lot done in a short amount of time . the cons it can take several reminders before i act on it , resulting in large gaps of time where no progress is made . i worry if i ' m burdening the people i love . it just so happens that the most creative among my friends and family are also the least likely to tell me when i ' m asking too much of them . i know my methods suck in terms of efficiency , but it' s the best i' ve got . the thousands of efficient plans i' ve come up with have sadly failed . so anyway . what works for you guys ? have you ever been able to sit down and just get shit done , day in and day out ? if not , how do you make sure you get the important things done?"

entp,"about two months ago members of this forum typed me as type due to ne but i ' m not sure if i really am an type . the first reason why i doubt it is because i ' m not sure if i ' m a judger actually . it is true that i tend to procrastinate and that i like change but i ' m also a planer and strategist . when i built my own business i was a mess but ever since things got back to normal( finally aftermonths of hard work )i feel like i ' m back at being the same old structured person that i used to be and i write plans for everything and get things done . the second reason why i doubt my type is because i don' t enjoy talking too much when not necessary . it is true that i could talk about ideas for hours but i hate it when someone comes up with his what if ? and what about talking . when my mother complains about something or mentions that she will do this and that i often interrupt her and say mum please . instead of speaking it out just do it and instead of complaining just ask yourself this one question to fix the problem . it' s the same when my friends talk politicsi think it' s just pointless because things are the way they are and if someone asks me about my opnion i come up with an answer like well , if you want change go vote . i ' m a very resultorientated but yet a very indifferent person when it comes to things like that and i don' t like talking about things i can' t have an impact on right away . i ' m a good mix of many personality traitsoutgoing , great at storytelling( i must say i ' m a good liar when it comes to that )and i ' m attention seeking . on the other hand i have very deep thoughts and i can become a philosopher . in contrast to my pragmatic behavior i can be very warming and supportive if someone really needs me and i hate it to talk bad about someone who is next to me , i just like it to give other people the feeling of being good at something and i ' m a good motivator . i took the enneagram test with type,andbeing the highest and,,being the lowest( in order ) ."

infp,"so i learn recently to accept my paranoid thoughts and to defuse them and i join a discord group . i get attached to them . there was great moments the person who introduced me was very nice!and she introduced me to her friend as people that were very tolerant and open minded . i am open minded and an type so to me it was very important . then they began to use n words( my pp was my true face so i appear to them as explicitely black or from indian descent ). at first i was very chill because i thought they used the n word with irony . but i began to feel they used the word as something very pejorative and something in their voice triggered me i am very nice so sometimes people overpass my limits and at the end i think i was mocked . their humor became condescending and insulting in particular two other men( it is often other men ). by the time the girl i first talked took a test and she was type and i think it was very coherent today , it was another joke i felt it was mockery , and another use of the n word , and i just loose it and tell them they were hypocritical and racists so they banned me but what i think is interesting is the way the girl reacted . she said that she knew totally that her friend were racist and that i meant nothing to her . and i find it fascinating the way she had a dissociation promoting their friend was tolerant( she was arguing i was incapable of taking things with irony ). i felt guilty for a second and it was basically the same relation i had with my mother . things are unfair but fe is too strong and strive to defend the group the most strongest way possible . whereas my high fi is striving for individuality , authenticity . i like the way guiltiness is used to impose and control somebody . sometimes i think she struggled to impose equality( some of her friends were gay whereas the other part was homophobic )and i liked it when she could impose herself i felt guilty i need help . this group was an enormous support for me( i had a neglecting family , and i developped a schizo affective disorder ), i use to be alone for a lot of time since i find cbt it pains me a lot to have such a hard experience i felt guilty because i have the illusion i bottled up my anger but i hate it because i haven' t bottled anything , i was really living the moment and discovering all that , it is painful to be judged on things i have not the control of i need to be estimed and respected but i have the sensation i wasn' t good enough that i behave incorrectly what do you think?"
isfj,"type' s are known to be fairly caring people . they seem to have a hard time letting go of love and relationships in general . from my time on the internet , i' ve even come upon some types who would describe themselves as people who live for love . but what about the other end of the spectrum ? do types hate ? for me , i don' t hate people . everyone has different experiences throughout their life and grow up differently because of it . there are certain actions and behaviours which i would not condone , but i tend to just attribute it to their opinions and choices . i usually just accept people for who they are . there are definitely people who have wronged me and my friends , but in the end , i tend to be able to rationalize why they may have done x , y or z . even if i have a strong initial reaction , i tend to forgive them after awhile and move oneven when i probably shouldn' t let it go."

esfp,"so , here is the whole story i was seeing some girl , i?d love to call it dating , but she?d always say ?we?re not dating yet? ? so , it all started at the bar , i was going out a lot back then , i was trying to get over my previous relationship and honestly , as soon as i met this girl i completely forgot about my ex . this girl was sitting on the couch at the patio with her sister . i approached them and asked them if they?re mediterranean they said no , they?re mexican , we started talking about various things , everything went well and even my friend came to wingman me talking to her sister . i remember i even told the girl that i?d love to take her out and that i?m not playing , i really liked her and later when me and my friend went outside we saw from the far some dude kinda bothering them i went to them with my friend and took the guy off . specific interesting moment from that moment was that i just came and stood next to her and when the guy asked'' how do you know her ? ''she said ?we?re dating ? and i repeated after her ?yeah , we?re dating ? and that was such a good feeling for me , because i didn?t expect her to say that , i was even afraid that she will reject my help to handle that guy . but everything went well , we started walking all( me , her , her sister , my friend )together to the parking lot holding hands . and it turned out they live at the same apartment complex that i live in and their building is right by mine . but she actually doesn?t live in the same town that i live , she lives. hrs away but she comes very often on weekends to visit her sister . so anyway , we reached that apartment complex , her sister and my friend walked away with her sister , kinda leaving us alone . and this girl came to me after getting off from the car and started making out with me , i didn?t even initiate that , she started kissing me . that was also very happy moment for me , because i had very low expectations , i didn?t think that she really likes me , because she is above average in my opinion and i thought she probably gets a lot of guys like me hitting on her and i?m no different( later , i found out that she actually participated in some beauty contest during her undergrad and she took the nd place , i never imagined that kind of girl would be into me lol ). and then we walked and sat in front of their building and she came to sit on my knees , that was so sweet . honestly , at that moment , i felt like i sealed the deal , that she?s mine , that we?re gonna date and stuff . and then i got her number and snapchat before i left . and then after that night , the next day we went to coffee place( i invited her ). i tried to kiss her there , but she covered her face with her hands and laughed and said ?you?re making me shy? ? but then after coffee , before leaving i told her something like that i?d want to date her , but then after seeing her kinda confused facial expression , i tried to fix my mistake , briefly i just messed it up , but she asked ?you mean you?d want to see me again ? and i said ?yes , exactly? ? anyway , after all this , we were talking for some time through snapchat . and the first thing she told me was that she was engaged for some time and she was supposed to get married last summer but then she called it off( she didn?t tell me what the reason was )and she told me ?she was deeply in love ? and ?imagine frustration coming after that ? and she offered to be friends . and first i rejected that saying something like i would not play games with her , it?d either be relationship or nothing . then the next day i agreed to be friends . i know , i know , i messed it up a lot , i?m embarrassed . then we?ve been talking for some time , and i need to be honest , although she was randomly snapchatting me but we were never really talking about something and at the beginning she wouldn?t even accept my invitation to go for a lunch or smth even with her sister . again , i have to be fair , at the beginning i was feeling pretty unhappy about how much we were communicating . but surprisingly , over the time , it got better , but to be honest i felt like it?s all because i was kinda pushing it . i started trying to keep her interested , sending her snapstext that would make her laugh or make her interested or make her just to reply me with something , then we went for a dinner( me , her and her sister )then we hanged out few times , and then i even invited her to coldplay concert( i payed for her ). we went to that concert , that was probably the peak of my happiness . all the time we were together , we were making out during the concert , then we were making out all night after the concert at the parking lot by the building i live in . i don?t know if all this is very usual thing for her , but it was new experience for me and i felt really happy . then , after that , things get messed up , once when we were talking on sc , somehow we ended up talking about commitment and stuff , and basically , she was saying that she has no commitment with me and she can?t promise me that now , and i was being very frustrated by that and almost kinda judging her that it?s wrong that after all this to think that ?it?s okay to see other people? ? anyway , there were few other small fights again because of the same commitment thing . and then i did something that now , i think , was very immature and stupid likeortimes i posted snaps with girls( like each time with one different girl ). i did that trying to make her jealous . i don?t know what she thinks about it . but , anyway , the main reason she?s been mad at me because of trying to control her or make her not to talk to some guys . after that , i asked her to block me on sc( she didn?t want to do that btw )and i deleted her number and i didn?t talk to her formonths . now , aftermonths , although i deleted her from all social networks , somehow i still had her on my whatsapp , so i texted her first asking how is everything and stuff and she replied . then like a week later i saw her at the bar but didn?t even approach her and didn?t even talk to her , but looked at her few times , to be honest i felt like she was deliberately standing nearby just to be able to see me , but we never had an eyecontact . anyway , few weeks later i texted her saying that it was pretty sad that i saw her but couldn?t even say hi , and she replied'' yeah it was a little weird ''and i replied that i just didn?t want to disturb her . then few weeks later , i texted her again asking if she?s coming to the university x( university i?m studying at ), and she replied( this time she replied fast , right after i texted ?hey ? she said ?hi? ? and she said that yes she already is living in town y( the same town i?m living in )and then sentmore lines about how she?s looking for a parttime job and stuff and i replied saying that i ' m glad that she got admitted . so , probably you guys will criticize me on how much i messed it up and how pathetic i sound and that i should move on . i realize that myself too , but it?s easy to say than actually to do that , i tried to move on formonths , but somehow i ended up remembering her again . so , anyway , dear types , i need advice from you , is it possible for me to win her back ? i believe the only way i can run into her is some bar in my town that we both like going . tl dr if i made type girl mad at me because of controlling her freedom , is there any way to win her back?"

istj,"a few days back i posted in random about passwords . one of the links on the site pointed to this why steve gibson' s password padding works for humans? eric gerlach which this part of the post i had never been consciously aware of let' s start with a discussion of the psychological . it has been known foryears that memory stores things in chunks . for example , if i gave you the following list of letters frgthiofwcaqnmfkip , and then took it away and asked you to repeat it , the research suggests that you' d be able to get aboutletters in a row right , plus or minus. however , if i gave you this list abcqrsefglmnxyzijk you' d probably do much better because your brain is able to break it into six chunks of three consecutive letters each . click to expand. . thinking about past memories( circular loop )i realized that much of my memory works in chunks like this . i also learned at one point( through nlp )that many good spellers actually have a mental image of the wordthey( often subconsciously )reference that when spelling it .( check out the eyetechniques of nlp for mapping leftrighthandedness in people. )this chain of thought also took me down to the business of ancient memory techniques like this which also brings up mindmaps and the like( something that i' ve been very undisciplined about using these daysstress will do that i guess ). all are reminders of things . us si users often have some interesting memory stuffi remember niss stating some time back that he can reexperience his memories sometimes . something that at the time i didn' t know i could do , yet in retrospect( and now )i can . a bunch of curious questions what might your reminders look like ? do certain things trigger specific memories , moods , and the like for you ? if they do , are they limited to visual or are they composed of other( or perhaps many )senses ? is this conscious or unconscious to you ? if formerly unconscious to you , what is it like now that you are conscious of it ?( as in , do you now recognize it as familiar ? or something else ? )addendum to clarify what might your reminders look like ? in reference to nlp having images of words , and mostly about ancient memory techniqueswhere deliberate images are chosen to act as a reminder . when you learnmemorize something , what do your reminders look like mentally ? have you chosen them deliberately( as in ancient times )or are they some form of habitual process which has developed organically over time ? for myself , my mental reminders seem to be in the form of chunks of text .( perhaps this is because i seem to have a very large vocabulary , as one of mbti enthusiast' s tests discovered several years ago . from memory , something like k words . which might be a correlation with my high te function. )second edit found the original thread , not mbti enthusiast after allwas kittychris . i also got k words , not k( my memory must be melting lol ).

intj,"as an type , do you prefer to extrapolate abstract , and at times subjective datapatternsinformation from an experience or specific example ? or do you prefer to be given abstract concepts which are subjective and apply that to specific instances ? i?m not sure if i have adequately conveyed my meaning , so here are some examples . event to abstract you are at the grocery store with your partner and you have plans to watch your favorite tv show , which you have recorded ahead of time , when you get home . your partner is at selfcheckout and you notice that it is taking them longer than you?d expect for them to scan groceries . you have a faster way of doing it , but when you attempt to take over , your partner resist because they prefer doing things their own way . you become agitated and irritable to the point that the two of you have an argument . using this experience , you are able to determine that you are impatient regarding the inefficiency of others , and that your reaction this inefficiency is much more extreme than what you have observed in the general population . further , you recognize that there was no time limit in place , and your reaction resulted because you wanted to move onto the next item of your agenda . you consider that your reaction would not have been as severe if you had no interest in progressing to the next planned activity and recall experiences where you know this to be the case . you make further observations in which time limits are a factor . abstract applied to an event you read information online that types can become impatient and stressed at the inefficiency of others . ?types are actually extremely focused on efficiency and awareness . they prefer to get things done the most efficient way possible , and can become short tempered with people who cannot do this . types are constantly learning and researching new topics which helps them to remain more aware of things.? ? you then use this information and apply it to experiences you may have had or in the process of them occurring . if anyone knows , what functions are being accessed to perform these tasks ? are they the same ? if not , how are they distinct?"

intj,"dear typeusers , there is something that has been in my chest for some time . i might be just here to seek validation . maybe i just want to let things out somehow . i do not feel efficient or intelligent enough in the ?eyes ? of logic and the sciences . i am having a bit of a hard time , i do think i am intelligent and my abstract thinking is quite high . but if it comes to understanding certain topics fast enough and processing them accordingly , just be it linking a connection to another topic , it seems a bit disorganised in my head . i love philosophy , but some theoretical constructions are quite hard to grasp to me or to separate them strictly like a knife . i only intuitively sense connections , but i can not depict them precisely . this feeling of probably never being able to understand many other sciences and not being capable to see global links and connections as good as the intelligent human beings who walk on this earth , leaves me with an emptiness . hence , i do not even feel worthy to help other people , since i can not systematically deconstruct thought processes efficient enough . i will always have to try harder and invest more time to learn things . i know , life is not all about logic . being a ?good ? human holds value too . but the sensation that there is knowledge out there exclusively accessible to those who are just born more intelligent , where i will always look up to with wonder and curiosity for the unknown , is very heartbreaking . to those who are intelligent , i feel like , i am perceived as someone who is wasting their time with feelings , arts and other disciplines . someone who is not worth of their time and affection . i do try to understand feelings with heart , but logic and reflection are required in order to help others in the most helpful way . basing your assumptions only on intuitive feelings is a high risk i do not want to take in helping a human being in their hardest of times . i have responsibility . thank you"

istp,"my type and i( type )have been together over three years , and we' re stil having the same fight over and over again . i ' m not sure what to do . last night i go out with my friend for dinner and text my type afterwards and am like hey , are you coming over ? and he said yes. . just calm down .( backstory on this is that i generally feel like i do not get enough quality time from type to feel loved , so i know what he means by this . however , i have been trying to be less needy , and i only asked him if he was coming over because earlier in the day he said he was and was only confirming . thus , i was calm , and his text surprised me ). in my head i was like okay , that' s weird , but whatever. . but then i called him from dunkin to see if he wanted anything( who doesn' t love dunkin ?  ! ? !). again , he responds all mad and says he has stuff he' s trying to get done( a.k.a . laundry )and he' ll get there whenever he can . again , i ' m like. . what is your problem , dude ? i ' m not being demanding , i ' m not rushing you , i ' m simply asking if you want coffee or tea. . asecond conversation . at any rate , he appears to understand me and end scene .hours later. . he shows up at my house . i greet him smiley with beverage for him in hand and he angrily goes sometimes i need to stay at my( parents )house where i live and i can' t be coming over here all the time . i say , i know , you didn' t have to come over. . i try to diffuse it . but , too late . argument ensues . the basic issue is that he thinks i ' m asking for too much , and i feel like he' s giving me too little . and , to be honest , i can' t tell if i ' m being unreasonable. . because i do feel like i ' m trying as hard as i possibly can . there are a number of background issues that are causing us to get upset with each other . type recently moved home with his parents because he is in school parttime and trying to figure out what he is doing with his life . he is. i am mostly fine with this because i know it is temporary and i know he just needs the time to figure out what he is doing with his life . on the other hand , sometimes i am sad that we do not live together . i often feel like we are not progressingmoving forward in our relationship , and that frustrates me . but , it' s like i forget about all of that when i ' m with him , and so that sort of serves as a solution although the underlying issue is probably still present . it' s when we are not together that is the problem . it hurts me when he will not drive over to see me or when he chooses school over me . i get it . he has school to do . but. . he' s in school parttime(classes ), and working not at all( collecting unemployment ). i know that makes him sound like a loser , but he' s not , he' s just in transition . but. . that' s just it. . he' s in transition and apparently , all his time is being sucked up by what is there. . which appears to me. . to not be much at all . i know that i have a tendency to be overly dependent and needy , so to help with this , a month ago , we came up with a schedule( neither of us are planners , but we tried to plan to avoid conflict ). i work full time during the day and he has classes on such and such days , so he said you can have this and this and this . which of course is not enough for me , but i was okay with it( really !)because at least i knew what i could count on and it made me feel loved that he would plan time with me( instead of assuming i' d rearrange my schedule for him ). yeah. . plan definitely didn' t work . one week in and he' s like hey , can i have off on monday because i have to study for this test. . of course this upset me , but now i am the jerk who won' t let the poor guy study !he' s like you knew the plan had to be flexible !i shouldn' t have to be kept to a schedule !i ' m not your dog or on demand !sigh . now , i know that it sounds like i' ve made him my life . f ' n busy yourself , type  ! find things that make you happy !i ' m trying , i am . i joined a theater group , and i have performances , fridaysaturdaysunday , i rehearse two to three nights out of the week in addition to working full time. . in addition to trying to make plans with the few friends i have. . in addition to living with roommates and spending time with them . although , none of these things measure up to spending time with type , and he knows that . if i could find something that fulfilled me as much as quality time with him would , i' d probably be fine . but , should i be punished because i haven' t found that yet ? i am at least going through the motions . i guess i ' m just wondering. . what is reasonable for me to ask of my type ? is it normal for me to be upset when he cancels on me or doesn' t want to spend time with me ? to be fair , he does not see it as him not wanting to spend time with me . but , i see it as , if you wanted to spend the time , you' d make it happen . i feel like i ' m some sort of obligation and it' s overwhelming for him to fit me into his schedule . and , i know , this is ridiculous to say. . but i guess the type side of me thinks that when you want to be with someone you are excited to see them and express this( i would go to the ends of the earth and back for you. . is how i think i am. ). type is already not verbally affirming , which i can deal with. . he does a million other things for me( make killer sandwiches , for example ), but if all i have to survive on is his actions. . and his actions repeatedly say. . oh hey , i ' m not coming over tonight . and his attitude says hey baby , i ' m relaxed about us . it makes me feel uncherished and like i ' m just there . does this mean i need something more or am i just comparing to what i see in other relationships ? obviously , types value freedom , and i do want to respect that . do you think we' re just not. . right for each other ? i mean , i know i ' m emotional and ridiculous. . so i ' m really having a hard time with feeling like i ' m already giving as much as i possibly can. . but. . blah . i just don' t know what to do , and i would like to find a solution before it gets worse."
isfp,"so last year , i( type )was ghosted unexpectedly by an type guy who expressed interest in me first and talked up a storm about how much he liked me and wanted to know me . he reached out several times later on but i?m not into onagain offagain dynamics so i didn?t pursue that further . fast forward to nowmy type best friend has been in a relationship with a different type guy , who is now demonstrating the same onagain , offagain stuff with her that the other type did with me . having more knowledge of her situation , it?s obvious that her boyfriend has a problem with their relationship and he has trouble being straightforward about it . both he and the type who ghosted me opted to distance rather than communicate . my question to type guys here if you?ve ever ghosted someone , why did you do it ? i want to understand what is the driving force . in both of the above cases , the type was the initiator and pursuer , so the actions don?t make sense to me."

esfj,"well , finally got the point of actually reading about the functions , comparing them and trying to decide which would hit me best . result would be that fe,si,ne,ti stand the most true for me , which would apparently put me into type or type . my roller coasters direction so far typetypetypetypetypetypetype ? no biggie , it doesn' t really feel like big miss shot and after surfing some comments from users who seemed most certain about their type and had stuck to it i ' m feeling slightly more certain about this too . though , what still feels mysterious to me is that generally there are stuff thrown to the type such as strict , bossy , mean , unchanging ? i mean , wth ? . those couldn' t be less like me , basically my leash doesn' t have any length at all , i let people do whatever they feel like( unless it is negatively affecting someone else )without putting any harsh judgement' s on their decisions because it' s their life , why should i point fingers on them . and not into change ? i could have sworn that the p at the end would have to be found from my type , i reflected it to being spontaneous and into new stuff and what not . but ques not . or does that automatically mistype me off from here already ? i am very into new stuff , experiences and changes . not that i completely leap from thing to thing regularly and forget previous things , but rather that i wan' t to keep going somewhere while still regarding the previous things somehow , memories as the worst case . plus my desk is a dump . which is why i though that i would have rather been type or type , the function descriptions however , would not agree as well as with these . not to mention that i ' m basically always on humorous mood , be it enthusiasm , excitement , self irony or simply because i feel like it for oblivious reasons , which again apparently isn' t presumed from typetype ?though there are other indications that seem promising , such as the type not being much into this whole type thing , very big part of me keeps whispering to my ear that you do not care about this which made the whole process bit slower , but my curiosity got the best of me once again . another would be the thing that types doesn' t seem to be that much into writing things generally . i do like to ramble and make oceans of text when it' s to specific faces at a time , but shooting stuff to masses , meh . ball so , i' d like some external thoughts so that i could maybe even conclude if i am or if i ' m not . then perhaps that information could prove handy in something , sometime . whoa opinions , directions , criticism , anything is welcome and appreciated , i don' t miiiiind .

esfj,"i have a strong feeling this is my personality type . at first i thought i was an xnfp and became really excited because i' d always wanted to be a writer , and here i am sharing the functions of shakespeare and tolkien . instead , my inferior ti drove me to question whether i really was an type am i really that creative ? i can' t come up with a million ideas on the spot , can i ? probably not . so kept digging deeper , realizing i ' m a fetype , and fit more the type function . i looked at the top notch careers for us , and came across our career description on personalityjunkie . some things written the investigative domain includes careers and majors in science , research , law , medicine , and scholarship , as well other forms of investigative work . this domain is associated with myersbriggs thinking and intuition . therefore , investigative careers are typically not recommended for types or types . click to expand. . okay fine . whatever . i had an interest in perhaps pursuing medicine , specifically psychiatry or neurology , but hell maybe i won' t exactly be the best fit here . but then. . the artistic domain entails creative work like writing , music , film , poetry , and literature . this domain can be associated with intuition , feeling , and perceiving . while sfjs may aspire to be creative because of their inferior( or tertiary )ne function , artistic careers are typically not their strongest suit . click to expand. . well crap . that just destroyed my dreams right there . not my strongest suit ? i spent nearly all of my life thinking that i was terrible in many areas but at least i have my creativity.i was so excited at the idea to write a book at some point . but here i am realizing i am a blip compared to the genius of the nedoms and aux types .oh and get this. . social interests are common among teachers , healthcare workers , clergy , trainers , caretakers , etc . click to expand. . caretaker . i ' m not saying there' s anything wrong with being one , but i never aspired to be a nurse . the idea of waking up every morning to look forward to cleaning someone' s poo or to deal with a bunch of kindergarten brats as a school teacher doesn' t make me try and leap to the future . i pretty much lost any hope and aspiration i had at this point . i guess i ' m trying to look past this and think yeah mbti doesn' t determine your life . hell , there must be an type writer or famous person somewhere . and there are a few , like anne hathaway i suppose , but still . i ' m just trying to salvage whatever little hope for me i have left "
entj,"i ' m an type and i am usually the best dressed person in the room . i wear mostly sweaters , button ups and nice pants( dark denim , grey or khaki pants ), wearing a pea coat in winter . i was wondering if types dress to follow style or dress to impress based on their personal preference . i attempt to dress in a manner that coveys that i actually give a crap about how i look , however , i never follow trends . my dream wardrobe would consist of suits , polos , sweaters , and khaki pants , clothes that give me more of a business or business casual style . i intend to look serious , and composed where ever i go , from class , to student government , to the dining hall , to football games . i have noticed that the couple of other types i know seem to behave in a similar way , they dress well but in accordance to what they perceive is well dressed . nonnt types seem more likely to follow fashion trends , and their peer group . what do you think?"

infp,"i highly recommend all types to not overuse the word sorry . this is my message to all types after being on this forum for a few days i' ve come to realize that this is something that many types would be able to relate to . as types we are very sensitive to how we make people feel , and how we express that might be self destructive if we aren' t careful . i' ve come to learn this over a long period of time the hard way and i want to share my experience for the sake of any others who might not have realized that they do this themselves . this is something i' ve learned the hard way over the years . i used to say sorry all of the time because i thought it was the nice and curious thing to do . it came naturally to me because i was always concerned about how people feel and how i made them feel . sorry i was late , sorry if i upset you , sorry , i cant do that right now because i ' m not home , hey sorry it took me so long to answer , i was on the other side of the house whenever and wherever it slightly seemed to apply i would use it . what i' ve come to realize is that when i too often say sorry , eventually it changes the tone of the relationship between me and that person . after saying sorry so many times for so many things people eventually come to believe that you are actually doing a lot of wrong things . it took me a long time to realize this . i never would' ve thought that before . they may even believe that they' re behaving much kinder and better than you in that relationship , whether its just friends or acquaintances or whatever . in high school i had friendships that ended up becoming very lopsided this way . i had friends who treated me badly to some lesser or greater degree and i was always apologizing to them for every little thing , and they never apologized to the same extent . in retrospect , although not perfect , i was very kind and very understanding . when a few of those friendships ended badly , they were wholly convinced that i was the bad one . i even had a girlfriend in high school break up with me after cheating on me who probably didnt even care much me . it was a one way relationship about how she felt , never about how i felt . even she believed that i was the bad one in all of it when it was all said and done . even after she cheated on me and left me i was still apologizing to her , and what for ? i actually cared about her and i didn' t ever cheat or do anything worthy of being considered a bad boyfriend . it took me a long time , and i didnt figure out until after high school and after falling out of friendship with a few people that i was always the one apologizing . i didn' t understand that i was making it appear as if i was doing everything wrong , and they would believe it . i ' m by no means a perfect person , but i now realize the true value of the word sorry . it is a word with a much more profound impact than what most people realize . maybe just try to say . save it for when it matters , use it wisely , and use it when you mean it . as types we are very sensitive to how we make other people feel so i just thought i' d put that out there can anyone else here relate ? thanks to everyone for being so welcoming on this forum . there are really a lot of rare and genuine people here."
estj,"when times are chaotic and the business is done by f' s and there is a lot of quick change or ideas thrown out , how can i help an type adjust ? would giving them access to their own folder where all changes are immediately placed help her feel more stability ? i know she wants black and white . she comes from one funding stream that does have very clearly defined black and white rules but now shes trying to figure out a budget that has that funding stream but also flexible ones where they are gray and no black and white rules . she desperately wants all to be black and white but to get that , all the other funding streams would have to change themselves . i think she brings a lot to the table , big on fiduciary and governance . what can help her feel secure and adjust before she ends up alienating everyone elseseems the more stressed she is the more blunt and less thought to the people around her and basically calls other peoples integrity into question in the grey areas because they dont match her black and white background which to on type really is like putting a red flag to a bull . they take their rep and integrity very personally . how to get her to understand she is right in the area she knows but she needs to be open minded and learn how the other areas work ? i just want peace and a climate for everyone to be productive and feel successful."
entp,"i' ve noticed a divide in types. . some are assholes , some are secretly assholes , in so many words . seriously though , most are witty and hold your word against you at all times , but i' ve also encountered ones that are generally easy going , non confrontational and dare i say sympathetic , peaceful seeming people that still encompass all traits of an type . i think the former individuals are often just people putting on a facade on the internet , jacking off to themselves and their reputation over their pseudoscience personality type( i cringed just writing that ). talking face to face with many types who fall in the more personable category give off an entirely different vibe . so , what the hell is up with this ? why is this type so polar ? curious if anyone else has even noticed this."

estp,"he' s clearly into me . i ' m into him.but the whole thing' s weird . i think he has a girlfriend .( i ' m not sure he knows i know this. . might. )at the same time i know , he genuinely feels for me ( ni ) . . its not just lust . i' ve seen protectiveness , jealousy , and utter adoration although it shows up for a second and then he hides it . being an type i ' m not easily duped and if it was just superficial i wouldn' t be interested at all . it' s weird . i can see him mentally thinking . i don' t know what exactly he' s thinking . he hesitates . but i know what he' s feeling about what he' s thinking and i know what he doesthe decisions he makes after the thinking . it' s just weird.kinda hard to read . then when he' s not thinking its likeattention on me . or if the thinking led to an opposite conclusion he backs off.always in control of his actions . none of these feelings are explicit.and i have a feeling if any of them were he' d step back . i ' m usually blunt but i realize being blunt with feelings would be a bad strategy with him but then i just hold back the feelings and i feel this translates as that i ' m being cold or not interested when he gives me all the attention . he' s playful and always wants to hug me , and somehow very good at getting it out of me ( i ' m not a hugger , but i can' t really say no to him ), he' s called my name out as he was walking away from our group to his car and he shoutedi love you !in a joking tone , but i knew he kinda totally meant it . i started grinning and put out my hands in a heart shape to which he did the same .( walking backwards )our mutual friend type was looking at him like he was an idiot. ( like a what are you doing ? look )probably because she knows he is with someone . xd he somehow compartmentalizes things in his head.not sure how . i really don' t know what' s going on . i don' t even know what my own ethics are at this point . i don' t know him well enough . i do really care about him though . i don' t wanna ruin a good thing if he has it . his girlfriend is a sweet girl . probably type so we didn' t vibe too much but i hope they work out.she even told me they were going to get married next year. ( don' t know if she said this because she' s noticed the interest he' s taken of me ) . . but you can' t stop yourself from feeling what you do towards people.so i' ve reverted into polite niceness with him , which i don' t know if he' s taking well . it' s all so weird . i ' m conflicted . i don' t want to pull away completely or go cold because i don' t want to hurt him . at the same time if i stay close , i ' m gonna give in .i wouldn' t ever explicitly state how i feel ( though he probably could put together to a decent extent )i' d probably start the indirect playful undefined suggestive flirting that' s comfortable and then i ' m gonna care eventually and then it' s gonna hurt .that fucking sucks.,. . this is why feelings suck . . sometimes anyway . he' s the one person that i don' t wanna hurt at all . usually i don' t mind breaking the fe or poking at people cuz it works them up , but once i was joking with him and called him an idiot or dummy or something but in an endearing way .( that' s kind of how i ' m used to showing rough affection , i grew up with brothers and many male friends etc . i ' m not good at the soft stuff. )he took it to heart( but didn' t show it , but like i said those quick micro expressions )and i felt like i never wanted to hurt him again . usually i' d rationalize why someone is wrong to feel offended when i mean well , but with him i just wanted to stop .and make sure i never did that again and then it made me want to learn to be affectionate in a better way . i think i' ve learned a lot from him about showing affection , about people , and accepting affection and love which i will forever be thankful for , definitely a milestone in my life and development . how he got me to want to , i' ll never know . but anyway none of this is the question . it really just brought up the question in my head . would an typetype really ever be able to have a good healthy long relationship . have you seen it ? i ' m not asking to see if i should pursue that guy , that' s really not the point of this question . i' ve learned to go with the flow and watch what happens with situations like this instead of think myself to death.yay for developing se . i just want to know and am pretty curious how these relationships play out.or any semi duality pair for that matter . thnks for the insight in advance!

enfj,"i' ve done the test plenty of times . i finally convinced my girlfriend( ofyears )to do it . she is a type . everything appears to say we are doomed . in fact it almost appears that since we only see each otherora month , that is why we have stayed together so long . the only real info i found on us together was from this site . soniocs webpage( i apparenlty can' t post links )but it says i ' m the benefactor to her( she is the beneficiary )it describes our relationship on this page our relationship is as follows these are relations of mutual respect between partners . superego partners may think of each other as a distant and slightly mysterious ideal . they often show interest in each other' s manners , behaviour and thought composition . both partners experience a warm feeling towards each other , but for the outsider , these relations may look cold . if superego partners cannot find common interests , their interaction can become very formal . partners normally think more about expressing their own point of view than listening to their partner . this expression comes from the confident side of one of the partners reaching the unconfident side of the other partner . the latter tries to defend themselves by projecting their confident points in return . partners normally show interest and respect to each other if they do not know each other well enough . when partners start more close interaction , they start experiencing many problems . superego partners may think that they understand each other well . however , when it comes to day to day matters or cooperative activity , partners start thinking that their partner is deliberately trying to do everything wrong . superego partners are not interested and do not make each other aware of their intentions . therefore their actions may look exactly opposite to what was expected . although the hope and the feeling between partners may remain as before , it does not prevent the conflicts penetrating their relationship . when both partners are extroverts one of them usually feels more unsatisfied with their position . the explanation for this is that they believe that the other partner does not pay as much attention to them as they should and are too occupied with their own matters . click to expand. . its kind of depressing . am i( are we )hopeless?"

infj,"it is not a lack of love , but a lack of friendship that makes unhappy marriages . i ' m currently into nietzche' s philosophy in life because i feel it' s not only true but also resonate with my inner thoughts . this one is particularly standing out to me as i am still searching for the one to be married to . i agree that what it needs in marriage is friendship because i think the saying love is blind is so true . it' s not true understanding . but with friendship there comes tolerance and understanding as we still need the person to be with us . even though love also makes us want someone to be with forever , it' s more romanticized and there is a pedestal or fantasy to uphold . therefore too much love in a marriage means there are more fantasy to complete which isn' t realistic . but without the fantasy marriage might fall down because the feeling might be empty like there is no relationship . and friendship is like the glue to be a bridge between fantasy and reality."

isfj,"good morning !my type and i have been talking about getting engagedmarried , but we' re in a bit of a unique situation . our one year anniversary is coming up , but we were in an open relationship up until last month . while i wasn' t seeing anyone else , he was living with his other girlfriend and continues to do so after they broke up , though she has become hostile . we' re trying to decide timing on getting engaged , seeing as we' ve only truly been monogamous for a month and would expect to be monogamous in a marriage . i always felt i' d be ready for engagement after a year( and i do ), but he' s still struggling with the breakup and not wanting to get engaged immediately afterwards . any thoughts on timing ?( i' ve been over his ex since i met her , but i understand it will take him longer tongue)i want to give him time to get over her , but i also don' t want us to wait indefinitely."
isfj,"type here and i was wondering how significantly jealousy affects you . i' ve been close to a few types but am only in a romantic relationship with one for the first time in the past year . there are multiple factors at play in our circumstances , one being temporary long distance . possessiveness and jealousy occasionally get triggered in my so because my functions naturally cause boundary difficulties in my life . this vulnerability of mine is actually a big reason i was looking for a relationship with an type because i need that kind of protectivedefensive functioning in a mate . i hate the way my instincts can unintentionally lead to distress on his behalf . so far we' ve worked through every problem well and my main focus has been on ensuring that we are on the same side of his defensive instincts rather than letting anything get between us . when something is important , i defer to his requests because he' s reasonable and considerate and not in the habit of casually trying to control me in any unhealthy ways . i' d like to know how you experience jealousy and how territorial you consider yourself . i would also love any practical advice for how i can better anticipate his concerns andor sensitively respond to his feelings in this regard ? ? thank you"
intp,"edit type not type . sry . dear type' s , i stumbled across this forum because i was searching for information on type' s . i' ve really enjoyed reading your posts on here !anywho , i was wanting to know ya' lls thoughts on an interesting situation i' ve found myselfgotten myself into . yeah. . i ' m one of those people who signed up on this forum just to get some luuuuvvv advice.ok no . sort of . moving on . i hope you can tolerate the length . it' s a mini soap opera but i would very much appreciate your input .the story first , he' syears younger and i ' m in my early' s . i met him over a year ago when i moved into town by myself to pursue a career( skipped college ). my first thought of him was wow . he would debate a rock wouldn' t he ? and , he says his first thought of me was i don' t know what she has , but i want it . when i met him , i was dating another guy , but we ended up breaking up , which was a sloppy and confusing affair . meanwhile , he had begun to follow me around a little . not too close , but i definitely noticed that he was paying attention . as i went through the emotional breakup , he was there and we basically fused into a mysterious bond of friendship . i' ve gotten to know his family very very well , and sadly , i' ve observed that there are many scars that haven' t healed yet . most of the conflict has been between him and his parents . he' s a pretty typical type , and i quickly saw that the strife was the result of)poor communication)impatience)fear for both parties . i didn' t find this out until i got to know him better . as we' ve spent more time with each other , we' ve gotten kinda familiar . for example , he picks on me and tries to get me worked up just for fun. . and i can' t retaliate logically so i end up throwing little punches and calling him names . laughing often times , the way he treats me can annoy his parents , who seem to have a reflex for reprimanding him on his various behaviors . to this he will begin spinning a web of logic and eventually it' s just a mess . i' ve learned not to play his game , but to learn from him , to listen to him and just to love him . and i love him dearly . we both have the same moral code , which is also lovely . there have been many nights of staying up until am talking . many winks . many looks . i' ve seen pieces of his mind that i ' m convinced no one has been permitted to see . the thing is , he says he' ll never marry . i ' m not exactly sure why he has told himself that this is the way to go , but he did tell me briefly that once there was a girl he was into but decided not to get involved with because he might hurt her . he had told me this when our friendship was younger. . but over time i started to believe that he loved me back in the same way . i held my tongue , but his parents kept harping on him for being so familiar with me , and he would tell me how ridiculous they were being because obviously we were , just friends . i eventually just had to tell him i was in love with him because he really was making a fool of himself . i think he thought i was simply being too emotional , in love with love , because he began to explain to me why i was mistaken for being in love with him , and why he is meant to be forever single . reasons like i ' m meant for servitude and i see humanity as a big family . but you , you' re supposed to get married . i love you too , but i can' t love you like that . i was very confused , because it seems like there is every indication that there is something there . sometimes he' s even downright flirtatious . also , he will go on about how my personality is so irresistible , how i make his brain hurt , how i ' m beautiful , how we' re almost like brother and sister but not quite. . on and on . do you realize what this does to the poor emotions of an type ?? dooo youuu ?? sighhh. . i ' m not trying to force anything though , and he is somewhat young . i believe he' s got to find out who he is in life before anything else comes , and that' s ok i can wait . but just today , he gave me a certain stare. . it was a long , sad , happy stare and i ' m not sure what it meant . am i right ? am i overreacting ? oi."

esfj,i' ve been watching a bit of star wars over the weekend and after watching the prequels i ' m convinced the anakin skywalker aka darth vader is an type . i know this is debated all over the place but i have yet to find someone that has submitted viable arguments that type is his type . most say type which in some ways is kind of an obvious pick but there is one serious flaw with that . he does way too much fe as the adult anakin . types have fi as their fourth function which means that it' s very rare for them to show emotions . in fact the whole premise of anakin' s fall to the dark side is that he cannot overcome his feelings for padme . in saying this i want to point out that i have been married to an type foryears and i know the type very well . there are three characteristics of this type that a very obvious in the anakin character .he is fiercely loyal( type and type are the most loyal types )he is ruled by his feelings( fe is his dominant function )he desire for control and closure is so immense that it drives him to the dark side( he is a strong j )the sfj types are also the most likely to develop grudges and be overcome by jealousy . this is obvious in episode iii when he fights obiwan . i' ve seen all these characteristics up close in my wife . her simultaneous desire to help others but also control them for their own good is very indicative of the way anakin behaves . he is clearly extroverted as he has no problems expressing himself . he is sensory . he is a superb mechanic . he is clearly a feelerhe demonstrates a large amount of fe . and he seeks closure almost constantly so he is a judging type . i would love to see anyone that has watched episodes i thru iii and has an in depth understanding of myers briggs give me backed up arguments to the contrary.
intp,"hey i wanted to know more about the way you use your first functions and how it is my experience with ti as third function . i also want to know your experience with the connection between ti and enneatype. i really am fascinated by ti in its way to seek understanding through the root of something , i believe it is my favorite function . it gives order to the different ideas i have and it helps me to see the systematic harmony in everything i think . i ' m not even sure if this is ni or ti lol . since i am young i didn' t develop it really well but i really like the way dom ti are used to question everything . sometimes it' s a little annoying for me , personally , because i don' t like my idea to be minimized just because doesn' t fit your perception . i really like to give new perspectives but i don' t like to be forced to consider something i don' t see , so it' s contradictory since i am this way too ahah . sometimes ti can have a subtle and yet weighting influence in my daily life that can be overwhelming since i need also to reconnect to the silence and contemplation with my interiority , because it really helps me to be more authentic with my time . i mean , thinking actively about certain topics is fundamental for me , but that alone doesn' t enrich me . what relationship do you have with silence , contemplation and emptiness , if you ever recognized it ? emptiness as neutrality . when you' re not trying to think about a topic and you' re wandering through memories and scenarios alone , what kind of sensations do you have ? what do you dream about ? do you see a centre and a core in yourself or do you feel like an aimless spirit ? does your identity have a shape and a form or is it of hidden source ? as ai don' t see a mirror in my mind but as a w i see a tiny reflection through a piece of glass that allows me to dream of something a little more personal than just shapes and colors alone . i don' t know much about your type , do you relate somehow to what i said about me ? if not , feel free to explain."
istp,"how did your backgroundenvironment make you less or more like type stereotypes ? when i read online descriptions of types , i tend to get this mental image of a blue collar american goodol ' boy , what with all the talk about car engines and tools and fixin 'shit and sports and whatnot . those things are usually associated with men and the working class in my experience . i know some descriptions also mention white collar jobs like surgeons and engineers as ideal careers but it almost seems like an afterthought , i don' t know . it could be just me . anyway , this made me think whether the descriptions are actually skewed toward certain types of types , namely working class white males . i suppose if that' s true , it could be because se tendencies are less apparent in women and middle or upper class people for various sociocultural reasons , so even if you saw a female or middleupper class type you might easily mistake himher for , say , an type or type . anyway , i ' m curious to know how you guys 'backgrounds and upbringing affected how you relate or don' t relate to type stereotypes . for example , as a kid , were you encouraged to do sports and other sebuilding activities ? was the outdoors a big part of your childhood ? were you allowed to tinker with things as you pleased ? how did religion affect your behavior , if at all ? if you' re a woman , were you discouraged from athletic or mechanical pursuits because of gender roles ? feel free to ignore these specific questions and make up your own."

istj,"hello , i ' m an mbti youtuber and i thought i would share this with the types on perc . if anyone has any feedback feel free to let me know "
esfj,"i just wanted to say hi since its my first time on the forum and i just wanted to share this article from celebritytypes . this should help to clear up any stereotypes associated with your type . enjoy !david keirsey nicknamed them the ?provider, ? and i have also heard ?caregiver ? and ?supporter. ? in general , the type stereotype is that of a mother hen louder and more expressive than the type , and therefore without any mystery about them . according to the stereotype , they are the eversmiling bourgeois worker bees having tea at exactly two o?clock on lace doilies , poured from tasteful , flowerdecorated china pots . if they don?t have such fine things , they?ll do their best to pretend , and if they have even finer things , one redeeming characteristic granted to them is their philanthropy and generosity . i intend to grant them a great deal more than that . to begin , let?s break down what constitutes the type functionally . they are a judging type , meaning that they prefer extroverted judging and introverted perceiving . this means that they base their judgment criteria on objective , outside information , while simply observing and drinking in their subjective information and experiences . you could say that they are more aggressive towards the outside world and more receptive towards their inner experience . their preferred way of doing this is through extroverted feeling and introverted sensation . extroverted feeling is accommodating . it adapts to objectively understood values , becoming whatever is appropriate , harmonizing or desirable for a given situation . meanwhile , introverted sensation perceives reality as it is , but invests its perceptions with subjectivity and recalls these subjective memories in similar situations . it is recording , or if you like cataloging or recalling . third , they are very similar to the type both prefer fe and si . the type , however , prefers fe more than si . nevertheless , they are in some sense the same type , or at least sister types . i personally like to call sfj types the ?guardians, ? because they thoroughly examine reality and compare it with all the past experiences they?ve collected in their database , and then decide how to best harmonize with or provide for or protect a situation . of course , ?guardian ? is merely a nickname to help me remember the sfj nature , and does not mean sfjs are necessarily interested in guardianship as we normally think of it . the type , then , is a ?guardian ? for whom accommodation of others is more important than their subjective perceptions . they are primarily concerned with harmonizing appropriately to objective standards of sentiment . the word i like to use to remember the type?s nature is ?cooperation. ? this word may not seem any more impressive than the stereotype cooperation is often thought of as ?not rocking the boat, ? which does not make for an interesting personality . however , this is an oversimplification in the case of the type they have great potential for gaining the cooperation of others , or eliciting it between two otherwise estranged parties , and thus using their gift as a tool to bring people together , or even summoning them into a force that can work as a single , powerful unit . at least this is how types seem to solve problems by encouraging cooperation between parties , by helping people to recognize their similarities and common interests , and by enticing them to become more and more of a true human family one united whole that can accomplish anything . the type can be very good at this type of persuasion . for one , the type is already well attuned to objective valuations? in other words , to what is generally considered valuable , normal , appropriate , or comforting in various contexts . the type , preferring fe to any other function , is particularly good at ?fitting in, ? wielding the known language and customs in a way that is pleasing and familiar to others . granted that they are good at it , the type can be a very enjoyable person to be around , very kind and courteous , friendly , forgiving , generous , and perhaps above all , easy to talk to , in the sense that they want to listen to you , have genuine concern for you , and will make sure that you know this is the case . if anything , the type?s fe drives them to give up of themselves for others , or at least to resonate deeply with that sentiment . the type , like the type , tends to be serviceoriented . other personalities are by all means willing to help , but this is peculiarly present in the sfj types because their fe is combined with si . i think a good way to look at si is as sensitivity to one?s impressions of the environment , rather like a sensitive , photographic plate( as emma jung described it? ed. ), or the vibrations along a spider?s web . this web is grounded and focused on things as they are , and not as they could be , which tends to give si types a downtoearth , practical perspective . in any case , the type demonstrates a certain grounded attitude that can be very helpful and stabilizing . types are therefore sensitive to the concrete needs of others , or more accurately they are sensitive to their own subjective interpretation of the needs of others , which can offer great insight or misunderstanding . in any case , one can generally expect the type to prefer the downtoearth approach . the point here is that types often come across as being grounded , and more than that as being reliable and disciplined . the combination of dominant fe and auxiliary si makes the type personality very interested in human connections . they like to work with people , and in the end , are trying to become one with people to cooperate fully with them , and to develop as rewarding a giveandtake relationship with others as possible . beyond that , the type loves the feeling of family , or of being a part of a united group part of a cooperative whole . to most types , we?re truly ?all in this together. ? for the type , if that motto is true , then it demands certain kinds of action . if we?re all in it together , then we?ve got to get along . there?s no reward for isolating oneself or for interacting negatively with others and getting them down . so the type tries to be very kind and warm and well connected with the people in their lives . i think harry s . truman summed it up best when he said ?the rule around here is that employees may not speak to the president . i break it every day and make ?em speak to me.? ? there are two final points i?d like to make about the type , concerning their tertiary and inferior functions . first , the type?s tertiary function is ne . like with the type , this manifests along with si as both a meticulousness and a multifaceted interest . for the type , intuitions are an objective matter they are something very much invested in objects , uncontaminated by any personal or subjective ideas( as is otherwise the case with ni ). as a result , their intuitions are much more clearcut , and? if you will? practical( at least in comparison with the injs ). second , types repress their ti , meaning they repress personal logical principles . for the type , this means a tendency to wander from what is certainly true into exaggeration for the sake of effect . for the type , who is less concerned with presentation of a vision than they are with pragmatic service , this repression manifests as a tendency to lose themselves in harmonizing with people . in other words , in their attempts to unite people into ?one family , one group ? they may make too many concessions overalign with public opinion , and forget their own sense of identity and ethics in the process . more than any other type , the type ?do as the romans when in rome.? ? so , in summary , the type is cooperative , and good at fostering cooperation . they are focused on , and sensitive to , the subtleties of peoples ? connections with each other , and they seek to persuade others to join in traditional conceptions of unity and family by way of appeals to goodnatured cooperation . types are practical , downtoearth , courteous , and warmhearted . unfortunately , they repress ti , meaning they may relinquish their own sense of right and wrong in favor of obtaining a sense of fellowfeeling with others . thanks for reading , and for all the types out there thank you for your warm hearts , practical minds , and for trying to help us realize the connections that unite us all . click to expand."

entp,"true story of the day . throughout my lifetime i have endured a general air of condescension from the world at large because , as an american , i am generally perceived as not knowing shit about shit outside of my own neighborhood let alone my own country . that , friends , is why i gleefully and with much poorly masked schadenfreude share this story with you specifically on this day . if you need help with your geography or history i?m sure the fine folks at google would be more than happy to assist . six days ago i was in boston?s west end having a nice conversation with a colleague of mine that hails from across the pond . i like and respect the guy . our interactions are relaxed and typically involve some gentle ribbing . at some point during our chat he stopped and his face became quizzical as if he were trying to remember something or figure out how to phrase something . after a moment he says , ?what?s going on this city ? what is this celebration everyone keeps talking about ?? first mental facepalm . i paused to think of the best way to explain to an englishman exactly what the fourth of july means here historically . i was given a momentary reprieve by his associate . she elbowed him , looked nervous , and stagewhispered , ?that?s when they beat us.? ? second mental facepalm at this point i wasn?t totally sure how to proceed . my brain was screaming at me to point across the charles and say , ?see that obelisk ? that?s the bunker hill monument.? ? then , point a bit northwest , ?aboutmiles that way is where ?the shot heard round the world ? was fired . then , ?maybe less than a mile down that way is state st . where the boston massacre happened.? ? then , ?see that harbor right there ? that?s where your military forces in boston went scurrying to nova scotia from after washington artilleried them out of the city.? ? and finally , ?jesus h . christ , we?re not even to july,yet . you?re lucky we?re not in philadelphia and a stone?s throw from independence hall.? ? did i say any of that ? nah , i didn?t . but a part of my snarky little type heart wanted to . instead , i clapped him on the shoulder , and said , ?it?s when we told you to take your king and shove him !don?t worry , you?ll love it , plenty of beer to be had for all.? ? we laughed , and all was right with the world in that moment on june,. nothing says mended fences like a sense of humor and sharing a pint of beer . hey , we even call this area new england , and order beer in ?pints ? even if it isn?t a metric pint . don?t worry my former imperial overlords , we still love ya . happy fourth percers."

estp,"hey guys , i ' m new so bear with me and let me know if anything is not okay . i ' m type so i hope it' s okay to be posting here . i need your advice . what do you think happens when an type is unhealthy ? not ill necessarily , just letting the negative aspects of their personality shine through . how do you come back from that ? basically , i' ve been seeing a person who strings me along just enough , then literally gets up and leaves for another country and doesn' t seem to care when i miss them . we have never been together , but i let myself fall into the rut of doing things for them and beingthereforthem( hoping to be their stability )without receiving very much in return . this continued to the point where i' d be grateful for things that should be bareminimum , like them wanting to spend time with me . worst part is i was aware of it and having conversations about it , but my feelings and impulses just always seemed to get the best of me . they look out for themselves , and i look out for them , and i know i need to look out for myself , but i don' t . i' ve pulled myself out of it , and have things on hold , but a small part of me wants to examine mbti as a potential structure for pulling this person out of a selfish rut . i refuse to compromise a person' s identity in order to' fix 'them , but can i help this person realise who they are instead ? this person( i strongly suspect they are an type )has good in them , and can care about people . they just aren' t mature enough to show it yet . should i stay , or should i go?"
intp,"i?m falling into a pattern . each friend group i?ve been a part of thinks i?m nice and funny at first . when i get more comfortable and authentic with them , they start calling me ?rude? ? ?annoying? ? and ?snarky? ? what am i supposed to do then ? act fake like they are ? make fun of myself like they are ? is it me , or is society a bunch of hypocritical narcissists ? edit i was angry when i wrote this , so i worded it negatively . my friends don?t hate me . we?re close and have been friends for a while . i just don?t like when people call me rude because i?m usually trying to help . like , one of my friends never eats anything for lunch , so i keep asking her why she doesn?t eat anything . she said i?m like her mom and annoying . it hurts , ok ? another time , a different friend kept drinking out of my water bottle . it?s my water , i need it , i?m not drinking from the damn water fountain . i yelled and everyone called me mean and ?feisty? ? it especially messes with my feelings because i never call them rude or annoying . it?s always me who gets called out . they?re just as rude and annoying in my opinion , but i never tell them."

esfj,"thought i would go directly to you guysgals . one of the only types that seems to be drawn to me naturally , that is , willing to approach me without me myself trying to send signals , are types . no other types( except for types )perhaps , compete . i don' t know if this is temporary frame of mind or what , but this type of romanticfriendbusiness relationship doesn' t seem like one that would work in the long term . from my perspective our value systems and ways of viewing the world clash quite a bit , so i just wonder why it is that we end up paired irl . maybe i' ve met some bad types , but it seems i' ve had to put on a fake personality to please them for very long at all . even when i feel as if i' ve turned this fakeness off , and observe that they' re displeased , they continue to come back anyway . i don' t want to lead anyone on , but it' s like. . i have to be very very blunt to have hope of ending what i see as an unproductive unhappy relationship . just being myself doesn' t do the trick of scaring them away . are you telling me this characteristic machinethinking and disregard for rules and pleasing people is attractive ? thoughts ? comments personal experiences?"

enfj,"hi all !i met two types yesterday on the d game second life . before this , i was not aware of anyone i know being type . the first chat i had with each of them were very stimulating and alive , much more so than usual . so i got a great first impression of your type . today i had another( brief )chat , which was initiated by myself( in contrast to the first two ), and it was mediocre and afflicted with boring silences . i definitely take a lot of responsibility for the disappointing quality of today' s chat , as i am apathetic due to residual depression . it makes me feel empty of thoughts and feelings , and so i find scarcely anything to say , which does a lot to ruin my chatting pleasure . i can barely make small talk . however , this was not at all any kind of prominent problem in the first two( good )chats , so i ' m looking for factors beyond myself . so i was wondering if it is common for types to be in chatty vs . unchatty moods . i realise all types can have a bad day , but it did not sound like she was down . if anyone would like to chat with me , to get an idea of what i ' m talking about , just drop me a line in pm and we' ll figure out a way . i ' m an xxnp that part is beyond debate , but i' ve tested as allnp types , most recently type . if i had to choose one , i ' m leaning to type when i ' m feeling better( which makes me more extraverted ), or type when i ' m feeling worse . cheers , albert."

istp,"hi there , sooooooo i ' m back here after a long hiatus and randomly got interested in personality types again( you know how it goes)i' d like to know if there are actually type' s here who aren' t naturally drawn to crafting , mechanics , or fixing things manually ? last week the screen of my smartphone broke and i put together a new one because i don' t trust another earthling with it , even though i don' t have a degree in it( i ' m a psychologistscientist ). but i figured meh i can do this myself through youtube and it turned out alright . but i ' m kinda neutral about it . i don' t really enjoy this as much as you guys it seems . when i was occupied with it i got really into it though , like everything mostly( typical type trait i think ). when i was a kid though i always opened up my computer to fix things or install something , but i lost interest in this , mainly because i had more interest in other stuff( sports , outdoors , girls , going out , and got really interested in selfimprovement ).' m aboutsure now i ' m an type through the opinion of a well known mbti specialist in my country but have been wrong many times before , a brief history , don' t laugh typetypetypetypetype my counselor in college typed me as type so that was kinda close . maybe because i was very social and enthusiastic back then , still have a lot of friends(the seek for adventure )but then it went completely apeshit in my head overanalysing everything got into some kind of quarter life crisis , thinking about what i really wanted to do with my life etc etc behold typetypetype period !i only have brief knowledge about mbti but could it be that type' s in crisis resort to there inferior dimensions while trying to look for possible solutions ? maybe i was even looking for problems where there weren' t any , and trying to fix it . could it be an type doesn' t necessarily need to fix things with his hands but it' s also possible on a mental level ? the expert who typed me as an type said it happens a lot that type' s think they' re actually n because of their resourcefulness but then the picture doesn' t fit anymore . i got into reading a lot about the type type and had an intense aha moment when i ' m really honest about myself this is just me !for some reason i feel much better now knowing this in my interaction with other people , like i got my mojo back or something and i lost touch with who i was before . still interested in your opinions though , always critical , maybe too much"

entj,"i am basically type at a core and i do cherrish this personality . while many people actually say that' statements matching type personalities often sound quite arrogant 'i do not believe in it . but what i want to talk about here is related here to a fact that we never give up . if things don' t work out we' re already half way defining a new plan , new approach . we don' t need any motivation or reminder of selfdiscipline . we also believe that life' s too short to sit and dwell on what went wrong . but wouldn' t we be better off picking our battles ? is it even possible to choose , as type , not to fight for something?"
estp,"so i ' m kinda new to this personality stuff , and maybe i ' m in the wrong subforum , but i ' m looking for some types to give me some insight . no offense to my fellow types , but i just wasn' t feeling the right vibes in that specific forum . i' d like to see the perspective from the type . if you don' t get bored of what i ' m talking about , of course , lol . i am an type gal who' s been in a long term relationship with an type fellow who' s been both the love of my life , and the bane of my existence foryears now . he seems strong and steady , never afraid to profess his love for me , while i ' m constantly bouncing back and forth between loving and hating him . so we' ve had a kind of chaotic life , and i ' m sure the details would bore you , so i' ll try to keep it brief .he is the financial provider while i ' m somewhat of a leech . i hate that fact , but it is what it is . unfortunately , i feel that i would be the better provider( if i had any skills or ambitionsspoiler , i don' t , so i rely on him. )in the sense that he' s very impulsive and doesn' t have a stable job . he just draws up these get rich quick schemes , but they constantly fail . i ' m always trying to teach him to think of the future or the big picture but it always flies right over his head , regardless of how often i try to advise him .he' s very charismatic and oooh , so charming in his ways . very earnest and very honest in his sentiments , which i envy . i wish i could be more like him in that sense . everything he says , he means , and every ambition he has , he plows forward with the utmost confidence , even if i deem it foolish . part of the lovehate dynamic i have with him . he doesn' t like to listen to me , but he seems to just prefer listening to his pretty little heart .we looooove to talk endlessly , and almost mindlessly ,( that' s how i fell in love )but it can be a double edged sword . we have this beautiful dance of conversation that can go for miles. . as long as we agree . his politics are very different from mine , and he often seems to have racist or just foolish ideas( to me )that set me off , and trigger me into starting heated arguments over things that i' d otherwise think are unproductive conversations . he often seems confused about why i get so heated and always wants to solve it with things like you' re so smart . or you' re just wrong .household is a mess , or at least it was when i lived there . things got way worse in my absence . he seems to be somewhat of a hoarder and an impulse buyer , so when i was around , at least there was minimal order like laundry being done or shit being picked up . but since i' ve left and i only visit , he' s a wreck without me . we' re both kind of satisfied with our own messes , but he' s always calling on me and expecting me to clean the trainwreck that is his rathole house . i feel i should be treated as a guest , not a maid , so that' s another area of contention . i could go on , but there are a few examples for you . do you think this is a good combination , or representation of an type vs type relationship ? i often have my doubts , and i know data or opinion can' t dictate love , so what' s your opinion on the whole affair , specifically if you' re an type ? he doesn' t like to talk about his feelings , so i ' m counting on others of his type to do it for him , haha."

esfj,"greetings you magnificent people , i have a sorta predicament in which i hope you guys can help with your perspective on things . i am friends with an type girl and even though our interactions have been on and off in the past , i' d like to believe that we are pretty close . although her friendship is something i cherish quite a lot , i bet you guys can guess that i ' m hoping for more than just that . story part . just some backstory , we knew each other for a long time but we never really spoke . however , back in, for some odd reason , i decided to be friendly and she reciprocated really well to that . the first time we went out , i sense that she was kinda into me , with the friendly texts when she asked me how was my day on the daily and sometimes would even ask me out . because i was a massive fucking idiot , i pretty much ignored her cause my feelings were all messed up inside at the time . we still spoke but very rarely( like texting a couple of times every few months ). towards the middle of last year , i decided to be a better friend and started being there more often , initiating appointments to hang out and stuff like that . things seemed ok at first but then she later revealed she got together with someone else while i was away being a fussy little bitch . they' re no longer together but he did her wrong( like imagine the worst thing a guy could do )and she' s not quite over him yet . spending more time with her again now , i get this feeling like i fucked up big time cause this person is really special . poor taste in men , but special nonetheless . cause of stupidity , anxiety and ni that can often fuck you over , i told her that i' d think we' d be good together and she shut me down there and then . failing to notice the obvious , she said that she was still hurting and needed time and that she didn' t feel attracted to me at the momentand that she didn' t wanna lose me as a friend . though i messed up royally and don' t really deserve a second chance , i sense somewhere in her heart that she might still have some feelings or could develop those feelings once again but she' s in a bad place and by doing something stupid , she' d probably hate herself and lose me as a friend in the process . we spoke again some time later and i reiterated in a different way that i liked her and instead of rushing things , i just wanted to get to know her better and for her to get to know me better as a person and that she needs time to heal . she said she still doesn' t feel like she has feelings for me but she' s more open to the idea . click to expand. . and that' s pretty much where we' re at now . with our time together , she shows me a great deal of trust and even though i' ve confessed to her , she' s still willing to go out with me one on one quite regularly , going for long walks in private and secluded places . we communicate much more often now , and i really enjoy connecting with her . she laughs at pretty muchpercent of the things i say . we share similar goals( though different means )and she seems comfortable my touch( playing with her hair , etc )though she doesn' t initiate . we' re starting to meet up on a weekly basis and could go on to twice a week pretty soon . lots of people tell me stories of how they weren' t interested at first and they were going through some major shit , but many times , they fell in love because of how their partner( usually the guy )is always there and he persisted and eventually won her heart by just being an awesome friend . so as you can tell , my fellow type friends , i ' m wanna play this late game card with my type friend and perhaps one day return to where we left off . i don' t mind waiting for her and being that patient guy cause i want her to understand that i ' m not going to just flake out and disappear again so she won' t have to worry losing me again . at the same time , i ' m also scared of turning into her gay best friend in which i' ll just effectively blow my chances . i want her enough to be her best friend but i don' t think i can really settle with just that alone . so i need some advice . . )what do you think of the storydo you think i have a chance ? . )what are things i should do to improve my chances and differentiate myself from just another platonic friend ? basically , any kind of input or additional questions would be welcome."
istj,"i' ve asked types on the forum for the same questions below . just curious about your perspective as well . what is manipulation ? is being manipulative a good thing or bad thing ? are types manipulative ? did you experience being manipulated before ? how did that feel ? what do you think about gender manipulation( being male and female )? ie. . females are usually called manipulative throughout history . why do you think that' s the case ? why are men less susceptible to these kinds of label ? bonus question if manipulation is a no go , are there levels of manipulation that are less offensive than others . ie . daring a person to do something( ie dance in public )versus using a baby as a reason to make a man stay in a relationship ? in another words , are all manipulation judged equally the same?"

enfj,"i am an type , and my best friend is an type . we are very similar people in many respects( sense of humour , values etc )but we also very different in important ways . i believe that part of what attracts me to her is that she makes no sense to me . i struggle to understand her . i thought that perhaps other types could aid me in understanding her .she says that she has lots of friends , but only two close friends . i am one of those two . naturally , for me , you' re either my friend or i am indifferent to you . i don' t understand how she can distinguish in her mind between friend and close friend , nor how she could come to such conclusions . similarly , i either miss you or i don' t . if i miss someone , it is clear i miss them . i am not quite right without them . for example , we work together and i have no fun when she isn' t there and i miss her . she claims to miss me , yet will go to work without me and have just as much fun . this doesn' t make sense to me .she never stops doing for people . sometimes , she runs herself into the ground trying to help others , some who are utterly unimportant to her in my opinion . no matter how much i advise her to rest , take time for herself and stop giving so much of herself to others , she insists that she is fine and that i worry too much . sometimes , she will help others at the cost of sacrificing time and energy that could be spent with those closest to her . is this a common type trait ? what motivates it ? what is the logic behind it ?do types struggle to prioritise ? while my friend never puts anything before her partner and children , i do sometimes feel like she puts too much effort into unimportant pursuits and people rather than the important people in her life( e.g . me and her best friend ).i often feel like she tells me things to make me feel better . i am a turbulent type and , at the risk of getting too personal , i do suffer with some abandonment issues and low self esteem . she will often tell me that she loves me , that i am in her heart and that nothing could ever ruin our friendship even though her behaviour doesn' t always support this . is it common for types to lie to makes others feel better ? similarly , is it common for types to be more about words than actions ? i am much more about actions obviously so i struggle when her actions don' t logically follow what she says .do types enjoy deep conversation ? i often talk to her about ideas i have had or thoughts i have been mulling over and she seems genuinely interested . the conversation will end with her usually saying , i definitely need to look into that when i get home but is never spoken of again .do types bury themselves in others 'problems to hide from their own or do they have a good grip on their internal world ?do types know what they want or are they too focused externally to truly know ?how patient are types ? she seems to have the patience of a saint . there are many times anyone else would have lost patience with me , but she still persists , and it doesn' t always make sense to me . i wouldn' t put up with as much as she does .how loyal are types ? being so extroverted , i imagine it is hard for them to hold down friendships for very long and to be liable to flit from friendship to friendship .is absentmindedness a common trait for types ? i have lost count of how many times she has seen a text from me or her best friend , looked at it briefly , put her phone down to deal with something else and then not respond for hours . i often tell her to just reply immediately so she doesn' t forget , but the message doesn' t sink in .is stubborn pride common for types ?is obsession common for types ? she is very much unwilling to let people help her because , in her mind , they won' t do it how she likes it and therefore it' s just better that she does it herself . e.g . housework .are types are a good fit for an type as a friend ?as types yourselves , would you ever consider a friendship with an type and why ? there may be more questions at a later point , but i cannot think of anymore at this time . any help would be appreciated."
enfj,"i ' m an type . i am new to this site so i ' m not sure if i ' m posting in the correct forum so forgive me if i ' m not . anyway i have a crush on an type and had a few questions to ask the types on this site .( i am not close to the type . i guess you can call us acquaintances )how do you know if an type likes you ? how do you know if an type just does not notice you or is ignoring you ?( i have read other comments on how types will try and hide how they feel and become shy if they have a crush( types do this too ). but how do you know if they are being shy because they don' t know you well vs being shy because they like you ? is there a difference ? or do types usually act more confident with someone they like ? )we have talked a bit , sometimes one on one and they always get uncomfortable while talking about something they clearly care about . is that an type thing ? do all types get uncomfortable when sharing their feelings ? also do most types hold back opinions if they disagree ? we usually only interact in group settings . the type is always with their best friend , could that effect how they treat others or potentially act around someone they like ? what are signs an type isn' t interested ? is there anything i can do to make the type interested ? i ' m an type and on top of that i am pretty awkward and shy . do most types like shyawkward people or do they tend to like people more charismatic like themselves ? thanks for taking your time to read this i know i rambled on and on."

entj,"hello , i' ll just get right to it . i have an type friend that i hired to do my interior design for my first home and for the most part he' s done a good job with the heavy lifting and coordinating . i however have a few significant pain points( as the project comes to a close i ' m realizing this more and more ). he makes significant changes to our original agreements , perhaps because he thinks of a better way but he never discusses this with me beforehand , and some of the changes had to be reverted because i didn' t like or agree with them . the latest of these was the setup of my tv which was way too high for my liking and comfort . even though i specifically mentioned to not set it up without me multiple times , he did it anyway and assured me i' d be happy with the result . when i visited to confirm this , i told him about it and he immediately deflected and asked me where was i when the setup was being done . i mentioned that i was never informed but he insisted i was . needless to say i wasn' t happy at what seemed to be a blatant lie.and had to pay to get it lowered( had it done by professionals this time since the risk was much higher )he is really hasty and doesn' t listen . i' ll ask a questions and he' d go on this long rant which comes off as condescending to me only for me to state he didn' t even understand my question in the first place . this has happened multiple times , my questions are very straight forward but it' s like he' s stuck on what he thinks i ' m asking and not what i ' m actually asking ?( i double check my questions with my friends in these cases to make sure i ' m not crazy )he takes the glory for many of the design choices that i came up with . it doesn' t bother me as much as the other points really but it is a bit odd to be honest , a part of me feels bad to complain because he worked really hard and did a good job in many aspects , but i ' m really irked by what comes across as a lack of accountability . he has never apologized for any of his mistakes and has even unfairly deflected some onto myself . what is up with that ? is it an ego thing ? do types have a hard time admitting they' re wrong and apologizing?"
istj,"hello type friends , i have a situation with an type that has me wondering about rejection . i recently found this about you all how type handles rejection depending on the situation types will often try to find a way to fix whatever has gone wrong . they will try to take a step back and look at why the rejection occurred . if it seems like something they have done wrong , they will work hard and try to make it better . if the type sees that it wasn?t something they did wrong , they will be very capable of moving on and ignoring the rejection . they know where they stand and are not going to be pushed around by someone who thinks they know better than them . do you agree with this ? what about the first line where it says ?depending on the situation.? ? what if the situation is one where you?re being rejected by someone you really liked and felt comfortable with( romantic or plato ic.either one )but you are now being ignored by this person because you hurt them , and you know and accept that it?s your fault ? how would you feel about being rejected ? thanks for the insight you all can provide .

isfp,"sort of a long post , but this is my first time dating an type person and could use some advice . i ' m ayear old gay type male . in june, i went on a couple dates withyear old type male( let' s call him taylor )who is finishing his residency and will be starting a new job summer. after the second date , he was forward with me and said he wasn' t up for a relationship at the time . i was new to my city at this point and thought we got along well enough to make a new friend , so i said i was okay with doing that if he wanted . so up until septemberwe were strictly platonic friends . i also learned after the fact he had only dated one guy in his life foryears , who ended up cheating on and ending things with taylor shortly before we met . however , i always thought there was something still there . i ended up acting on this one night in early september and since then we have been casually dating for the last few months . he also ended up admitting he had interest on his end , but didn' t want to mess up our friendship and never acted on it( which part of me is still worried about ). we' ve hung out way more frequently than we did prior to this , as much as his residency schedule will allow( wastimes a week , with some weeks not seeing each other ). i feel like we' ve had a lot of fun and both feel very comfortable with each other . he' s openly stated he trusts me and we have been communicating honestly about where we' re at . i typically don' t do casual dating as an type( it' s difficult for me not to bond with people )and this is the first time i' ve dated someone i had been friends with before , so this experience is new to me . from what i' ve read , types usually only casually date to see if someone is a good match for them , but idk if that' s the case here . he' s said he' s never done any sort of fwbs before , so i' ve been curious about our situationship and why he' s entered one with me . there are times we hang out when we don' t hookup , even when staying the night . so i know he' s not solely in it for that aspect . as a caveat , he' s likely moving to a cityhours from where we are now inmonths . recently we talked about where things are going and he said he feels like he doesn' t want anything serious at this point because he' s not at a place where he caninvest in me like he should . he said he likes being with me , finds me attractive , is intrigued by me , and feels like he should want to be in a relationship with me , but is not there . he also said if he got to the point where he could totally invest in a relationship i' d be the first person he' d want to try to seriously date . he also said i ' m currently the only person he is making time for besides his best friend , which i know means a lot coming from an type . we' re going to spend this upcoming weekend together , which is a first( we haven' t hung out for multiple days in a row yet ). he isn' t trying to date or hookup with anyone else right now( has no interest )and has directly told me this , but has said if i felt like i needed to move on and date other people he would understand . so i guess my question for other types is how i should approach this situation ? i ' m trying to look at this realistically . i know there' s a chance things will not work out in the end . however , i believe the things he' s said are true and he' s just not placating me . we' ve talked how staying in each other' s lives is the most important thing and if we needed to go back to being friends to maintain that then it was the priority . i' ve been on the fence about how long i should give him to feel things out , as i know i won' t be able to keep myself from getting attached to him after an extended period of doing this . while he is making time for me , there are some things i ' m not sure how to interpret . i tend to do most of the date planning , but i know types aren' t big into this . he' s also sparse communicating between hanging out( can go a week or more without talking if i don' t reach out ), but on the flip side the last time we talked on the phone it was for. hours( he did a ton of the talking ). he' s told me he doesn' t like his phone much , and when we' re in person he' s very present and rarely looks at it . he also doesn' t ask a ton of questions about me , but has been opening up more on his end and seems better if we' re just reflecting on ourselves vs . me asking about him . but on the whole , i get the impression he is way more comfortable with me taking the reins on everything . he even waits for me to make the first move when we are hooking up . are these typical behaviors for an type or red flags ? from what i know , types need time and be free from pressure when deciding something major like choosing a romantic partner . also , i ' m sure being cheated on has done a number on his ability to commit . i ' m not in any rush to find a relationship and not really tied down to my city , so there' s a part of me that wants to wait it out and give this a chance while not being blinded by idealism . i' ve never had the opportunity to date a friend , and it' s been super nice that we already know each other and can focus on hanging out with naturally learning more personal things . i directly asked if maybe i just wasn' t right for him and he said he didn' t think that was the case , and once things were settled he could be in a better place for a relationship . i' ve also asked if he wanted to end us dating and go back to being friends , since i' ll be gone for a month over the holidays and it was a good breaking point . however , he doesn' t seem to want to do that . is he just keeping me at a distance to know if he is sure there is some sort of future there , or is this just an emotionally unavailable type ? should i just go with the flow and see how the nextmonths turn out or should we go back to friends and tell him i ' m open to things in the future but can' t sustain the current situation as it is ? any straightreal advice from types would be greatly appreciated."

istj,"ok guys . this scenario will take a lot of explaining but i really need help . so i know these two guys , they are brothers the older is an type and the younger is an type . so first off they are complete opposites , which doesn' t help matters . the problem is that the type is very violent towards the type both physically and verbally , to the point that the type is in pretty much constant physical pain somewhere on his body , and is emotionally very insecure . also , i should mention that i am dating the type . no one knows this because we aren' t old enough so we haven' t told anybody , but the type is pretty suspicious and he will tease the type about me and insult me in front of him when i ' m not around . well , it' s very true that types like myself loathe conflict , and this situation is emotionally hurting me almost as much as the type . however , anytime i try to get involved , the type along with my parents tell me to leave it alone that it' s not my fight . i tried a verbal assault once , but it didn' t phase the type .( they are so aggravatingly confident in their rightness !)right now i ' m trying to just ignore him , but i ' m still aching to get him to leave the type alone . another big problem is that the type refuses to retaliate . he truly adores his big brother and despite my encouragements will not hurt him . i' ve been trying to figure out why the type acts this way in the first place , and the obvious reason is that he is jealous of his younger brother , who has more friends and a much kinder heart . i imagine that he hates how hateful he is , but the fact that he can' t seem to do anything about it only causes him to be angrier and more aggressive . anyway , now that you know the background information , please please give me wise suggestions for dealing with this type . how would you prefer being approached , and what would just make you angry ? are there ways i could help him ? because i truly want to do this in a way that builds him up . i want him to stop out of love and kindness( both from me and his brother to him , and from him to his brother ), not because somebody pinned him to a wall and punched his guts out unless he promised to stop . so how can i love him through this ? and how can i make him stop ? kitty"

enfp,"hello everyone who' s reading this . im an type dating an type for over a year now . things are pretty nice , however , he is facing some stress and depression which i seem to not be able to help with . he is kinda blocked because of this , which i understand , however , im unable to find a good answer to his problem . the issue is the following he' s not happy with his current life as he looks to his past too much , says things were way better in the past and that he has not acomplished anything is these years( which is not true we' ve discussed this , he has done a lot of nice things however , due to stress , he seems unable to not punish himself ). regarding his daily life , he claims that he only gets happy when interacting with people , the better if they are a new group of people . i get it , so i proposed him to have more outdoor activity( he currently has almost no outdoor activity ), however , due to depression , he is unable to engage anything . he claims he does not have the energy to go out , even if he knows that makes him happy . on the other hand , he does not seem to have a good relationship with mortality and gaining age . this is an important point because my view of mortality is quite on the opposite side i see mortality as neccessary in this world and ive coped with this a long time ago . so , actually , im always kinda happy for the future overall im quite optimistic and always hoping for new interesting things to come but he thinks age only takes away his energy , he says his' golden age has passed , and he also fears too much his parent' s death( they are pretty young still , they are not sick or anything ), he feels like' time is running out '. so our points of view are kinda clashing at this point and i think my optimissm is not helping him . pretty much his depression , rooted on sth i cannot comprehend , is stoping him to engage any activity as he cannot see the light at the end of the tunnel . what do you guys think about this ? i would be glad if someone could give me a glance on type' s stress and how to give him a helpful hand . also , i' ve recommended therapy , however , he is not too keen on it so i dont wanna push it . thank you .( sorry for long post ) "

esfj,"hi type forum !i feel like i?m beating a dead horse here , and in my personal life as well . i?m completely confused and very hurt though , so once again i?m here for guidance . my wife sometimes gets my intentions wrong and then punishes me for things that i never thought or did . when i say punish , i mean treats me as if her false beliefs were true and once that happens there really is no recourse for me . i?m just screwed and she?s angry . yesterday , i was running late for work . my wife and i ride to work together . usually ,times out of, my wife is running late and i?m in the car waiting . i have learned to never say anything about her being late because she can?t handle the criticism . her constant tardiness is a major sore spot in her life . anyways , because my wife is always late , i always load the car with her various bags and hoards of unnecessary trinkets that every type seems to need before they go anywhere . i also leave my keys in the door so that she can lock the house as she runs towards the car , pausing to spit out her mouthwash along the way . yesterday , there was a critical error on my part i missed grabbing her purse . she assured me that she would get it and told me to run to the car and get it started . to my wife , these sort of crazy steps are a necessity of trying to get somewhere . she honestly believes that if we somehow run around like chickens with our heads cut off that we could still not be late . i know it?s pointless , but i go through these silly motions because i love her and she needs them to feel less bad about herself . so , because she had her purse she also had the second set of car keys. . which meant that i was standing beside the car loaded down with all her bags waiting for her so that i could open the car door . she sees me standing there and immediately starts yelling at me for not having the car preloaded . i get defensive and say that she has the car keys . now , she?s mad . she declares i guess you are in a bad mood today . the thing is that i wasn?t in a bad mood at all , but since she has now declared me to be , it excuses her from accepting that she was a bitch to me for no real reason other than she hates being late all the time . so , we drive to work . along the way , some idiot is cutting people off and driving like an ass . my wife , for whatever reason , defends everyone in the world from my declarations about their driving skills . it?s like her personal crusade to save strangers from my unheard verbal assault on their poor driving skills . maybe he wasn?t paying attention , she would say ? maybe he?s late ? i don?t really care for the reasons people are idiots but my wife does . recently an idiot plowed right in to the side of our car and my wife yelled out what did you do !i told her that i got hit by an idiot . the car insurance company agreed with me , as did the police report . my wife still thinks i could?ve avoided it . anyways , i digress . as i am complaining to myself about this woman?s terrible driving , my wife starts defending a separate car . i tell her that i?m talking about someone else entirely . she still keeps defending this driver and i said that she is putting on her makeup and i?m driving , so i am a better judge of the situation as i?m actually watching the road . this is the sort of nonsense i deal with everyday from her . so we park at work and she is anxious about being late . she?s standing on a busy street corner waffling in and out of traffic with her bags. . attempting to cross on a dont walk signal . cars are everywhere . i?m not risking my life when we are already tardy anyways . at our job , if you?reminutes late , you?re late . it was already pastminutes , so you may as well just take your time . i?m watching traffic and i turn to see another crazy type lady withhuge bags saying to my wife that they can make it across if they run . at this point my wife is in the middle of the intersection dodging cars . she looks back at me and i?m just standing on the corner . i wave her on because there?s no way that i can safely catch up to her . she looks angry and comes back to the corner with me . this is where everything goes bad and a major marriage crisis begins . my wife says that i?m just in a bad mood and trying to be difficult . that is a lie . i said , you said that i?m in a bad mood , but i?m not . i am not in a bad mood . she gets really angry and starts walking the other direction . i walk towards her and she starts acting out in public , walking away from me like i?m some abusive asshole or something . she scowls at me and mutters at me . we go in the building separately . i clock in a bring her bags that i was carrying to her desk . at this point , i am angry , but i just drop her stuff politely . i don?t look at her or say anything . honestly , i felt a bit like she?s a nutcase to treat me like she did . anyways , there?s a heavy cart that i get for my wife every morning because she has back pain . i go to get it and she charges aggressively into the room with me and starts grabbing at it , trying to pull it out of my arms . she is saying things like give it to me and i don?t want your help . she was extremely pissed and i said loudly excuse me , refusing to let her have it . she backed down and i took it to her desk and left . i left her office confused and very hurt . i went by briefly at lunch and tried to pat her on the back and soothe things a bit . i didn?t argue or do anything other than small talk . i wouldn?t see her again until we left for home later , and that?s where it went nuts . we are driving and she asked if i were still in a bad mood . by this point , she is acting like nothing had happened at all , smiling , being chatty . i said that i wasn?t in a bad mood at all , but she said i was . she gets angry and starts up about how earlier i was standing in the driveway looking at her like i wanted to kill her . i told her that from my perspective she came out scowling at me and jumping all over me for not having the car loaded . she denied being angry , which i must say is false . she was the one in the bad mood about being late . anyways , she refutes my side and proceeds to claim that i refused to cross the street with her because i was being an asshole . that simply wasn?t true . i told her that i was looking down the street at oncoming traffic and when i turned around she was already halfway across the street . i told her that i waved her on because i couldn?t safely catch up . she said she came back because i would be mad if she walked into work without me . i do get mad when she storms off from me in public and acts like an idiot but this wasn?t one of those cases to me at that point . it became one when she got all pissy and upset and did just that to piss me off . at this point my wife gets really angry because she believes that i was being an asshole to her intentionally and not owning up to it . she was mistaken . i was not going to admit something that simply wasn?t true to appease her craziness . she started screaming , flailing , and basically having a child tantrum in the passenger seat . she flings open the car door while i?m driving on the interstate atmph . she starts insulting me and mentioning divorce . she said that i was ruining her life . i just try to calm her by not antagonizing her but she seemed to be trying to inflict the worst emotional pain on me . she said , are you gonna start crying now ? she was sarcastic , vile , and in that moment i wondered if she even loved me at all . how could someone say such things to someone they love ? she threatened to leave me . all i said to her is that she had judged my actions wrongly . she kept screaming that i did it intentionally because i was trying to hurt her . i said that i?m not that kind of person and that i love her . i asked her if she could admit that there was a possibility that my side could be the truth . i didn?t expect she would agree that my side was true , just to admit the possibility that she could be judging me wrong . she refused . anyways , i?m hurt deeply . i don?t want to touch her . i don?t feel anything towards her except numbness . this blowup wasn?t my doing . she?s been under immense pressure at work and was called on the carpet earlier in the week by her boss . she?s been in a horrible mood . our marriage has been going pretty well lately , with no real issues . i did get into it with her about a camping trip , but that?s pretty much it for any fights lately . i?ve treated her with love and kindness for months . i simply don?t understand how things can go so off the rails from a simple disagreement."

isfj,"characteristic of this aries type man( as described by his sister , who is a relative of mine ). if he doesn' t like a girl( that the family member arranged him to meet ), he will just drive away without entering the restaurant .. his family is pushing him to get married but he doesn' t give a damn for it .. he doesn' t do things to please people .. he doesn' t talk much in front of others( i would say he doesn' t talk at all )i was arranged to met this type man who is in different country . it was plannedyears ago , neither do we actually take the initiative to meet each other . recently i was asked again by my family to just go and visit him . so i did . for the first day that we met , he actually brought me around( he talked a lot about his work , his school , the places , politics while driving )and then we had dinner which ended with ice cream before he sent me home . i told him if he is busy then he doesnt have to pick me up tomorrow( sun ). he said he is okay and can do it . so on sun , i and my mum went to his house to meet the family members as planned by his sister( because his parent actually wanted to see me too )then proceed with family lunch . he brought me to museum after the lunch and he sent me home after that( he has to work on mon ). i have got no feeling towards him at this point . then his sister told me that he will be picking me up for dinner on thurs night . during the dinner time , we talked and laughed a lot too( i asked why didn' t he give other girl some chances , he said there is no need to waste time if he doesn' t like the girl appearance ). he said he wants to bring me to a place( which is very far to travel , i said i ' m not interested because it is way too far and i might be nauseous during the journey , in addition i have plan on sat , so i declined his offer. )we continue the talk , he then sent me back after dinner . by fri morning , when i woke up i realised that i wanted to spend more time with him . so on sat morning , i told my mum that i don' t want to go out with them . his sister pass me his contact number and ask me to contact him , she said she told him that i ' m home alone . so on sat we actually went out for movie . we had dinner before the movie , he told me about issue in his work and i chat with him . after the dinner , i tried to hold his arm while we walked to the car , but he evaded so i just pretended nothing happened and proceed to the movie . i wasn' t paying much attention to the movie as i ' m very bothered of why he evaded me( since he is willing to spend time with me ). plus the movie was boring . at the end of movie , i told him the storyline was boring , he agreed too . he told me that he will be bringing me to place that is nearby , tomorrow noon , and i said okay . so we went out on sun , i didn' t speak much through out the journey . i had a hard time to walked on high heel at the beach and ask his help to support , he ignored me . i asked for a wefie photo , he said he doesn' t like to take photo . so i was feeling really down . on our way back to home , i can' t help it but to ask if he actually likes me , he said he has some positive feeling for me . i said why is it so , he said because( i )he felt comfortable with me ,( ii )i understood what he said and( iii )i ' m a girl who takes care of people . but it is too short for him to verify his feeling and suggested we should just let go( since we are in different country , it will be hard for us to hang out to understand each other more ). i disagreed and said things can be worked if we wanted . he said he will talked to me tomorrow after work . i agreed and walked away . on mon night , we met for dinner and discussed about it . he said he needed time( he promised to get back to me in a month and we will keep in touch when i ' m back )to review and think back what we have done in the past few outings . i told him if he is okay to try i am willing to let go of my work and come over . he asked me not to be impulsive and i should also think for myself . at the end of dinner , i asked him if i can hold his hand he said it is better not to . i was taken aback and was angry but i didn' t say anything and kept quiet . he most probably realised that i ' m way too quiet and glanced at me twice before asking me if i ' m angry , i told a little annoyed . when he finally reached his sister home( where i stayed thoughtout the holiday ), i say thank you and then stepped out . on the day when i ' m travelling back to my country , he didn' t send me any message . so i actually texted him when i landed safely and initiated the conversation twice . both of which were ended by him really fast . so i asked if he doesn' t like mesagging , he said he prefer to talk face to face . i asked if he wants to know me better , and he ignored the message . so , afterdays , i sent him a song( rooting for youalessia cara )and told him if he doesn' t wants something he should just speak out . he apologised the next day and said his phone is cracked . we had some conversation that lasted longer this time . at the end of session i told him i will be away without phone( for vacation )and i will get back to him . when i finally get back to my phone , i sent him a few photos of my vacation and asked him how is his work . he actually replied that afterhrs without the intention to sustain the conversation( no question is asked ). i was very disappointed so i ended it with a thumb up icon . and he never replied since then . summary. i told him i like him. he said he has positive feeling towards me. he said i looked nerd( first impression ). he said he is comfortable with me , i understand what he was talking about , i ' m flexible to people. he said he has bad tempered. he said we don' t have enough of time to know each other and that we should just let go of this . i disagree to that directly .. he said he needed time to think(month time )and review what we have done in the past few outing .. he said he dare not asked me to quit my job and come over to his country. he doesn' t allow us to have any body contact( not even to hold my arm when i was having difficulty to walked on high heel at the beach ).. i was angry at him( i was quiet throughout the period )once . he didn' t do anything and just let me walked away without resolving it .. i told him that i have even thought of having a baby with him( that i don' t see this with other men ). my question is. if he doesn' t see a future with me( if distance is an issue ), why was he hanging out with me in the first place( in spite of me telling him that he is busy , he doesn' t has to bring me around for the next few day )?. why does he tell me that he has some positive feeling towards when u asked( he should have just told me that it won' t work out ).. why does he say keep in touch while he doesn' t wants to chat at all .. what is in his mind ?. what should i do ? walk awaybe more understanding ? is he a player ? confused type , scorpio girl"

infp,"this thread is a place to post epic cover songs . this means that the cover exceeds the original in some manner , or just brings a unique , appealing twist to the original . below is a pretty well known example to get the thread started . while bob dylan originally wrote and performed all along the watchtower , many people( myself included )prefer jimi hendrix' s version . when posting , please also try to post the original artist' s performance so others have something to compare your chosen cover to."
enfj,ever felt that there you need to figure out the world and belong somewhere but can' t actually able to stick to one place ? are you one kind of me or some other perspective fellow types your turn ?
enfj,so i' ve been snooping around many forums and there tends to be stereotypes for many of the personality types.do we have stereotypes besides awesomeness ? laughing
estp,"last night i had a window from anhedonia . i felt very sad . idk if it' s an type thing . a lot of type' s get misdiagnosed with bipolar cuz they get sad quickly due to self reflection and feel useless . i wanted to play video games again and not care what other people think of me because i was putting way too much pressure on myself by doing literallydifferent things to improve myself , doing entrepreneur things for months. . working on myself , helping others. . musicians use sadness and pain to make music . not everyone that is like that is useless . they might not often be entrepreneurs( type )and talk about sex and money all the time but great art is made( like type ). eminem is an type and slim shady is type . type' s want to benefit from all of life and you get every bit of life from every personalitythey' re all needed . type( i ' m naturally this without psychedelics when i was apathetic , or before i need to trip again )type( i ' m this when i work on myself or stressed )type( i ' m this while on stimulantsstimulants are type' s drug of choice )type( i ' m this while on stimulants and i work on myselfthis is what i got right now when i took the test )type( this is my depressed persona )type( this is my best statewhen my persona uses inspiration out of sadness works on itself )type( this is my manic adhd persona )type( this is my manic persona when working on self )i do however seem to talk about drugs a lot . here' s the list of drugs i' ve experimented with phenibut , gabapentin , pregabalin , diclazepam , nifoxipam , lorazepam , alprazolam , etizolam , flubromazepam , clonazepam , zopiclone , ketamine , deschloroketamine , dextromethorphan , methoxephenidine , methylphenidate , methylmethylphenidate , ,dichloromethylphenidate , fluoromethylphenidate , ethylphenidate , cocaine , crack cocaine , methamphetamine , fluoroamphetamine , dichloropane , fluorophenmetrazine , adderall , vyvanse , caffeine , nicotine , ephedrine , apvp , apb , apb , mdma , marijuana , psilocybin , meomipt , dmt , allylescaline , plsd , mebroqualone , armodafinil , alcohol , diphenhydramine , hydromorphone , oxycodone , codeine , u , kratom , heroin , etc. . psychedelics are my favourite because they make me see past all the bullshit . i wanted to invest in the stock market since i wasbut being type , i was too depressed and schizo to do it . once i turned, i blasted my brains out into creative paint and eventually started working on myself instead of sleeping all day on my antipsychotics . i believe that when taking antipsychotics in the right set and setting , psychedelics can cure schizophrenia but it' s a risk , a chance of it getting better or worse( for me , my neurons made the right connections from neuroplasticity of the antipsychotics and neurogenesis from the psychedelics ). not many people know what i know about researching pharmaceuticals or the cure for a lot of mental illnesses . i know a lot of certain drugs make personalities go into the superego , subconscious or unconscious . i also have atypical autism(inpeople have both schiz and autist before age)so that' s kinda where the high intuitiveness comes from . i only consider myself to be intuitive and alter my consciousness into different realms . the type makes me make notes and logs of every drug and dose , which day taken , using a mg scale , test kits , volumetric dosing , etc to ensure that i ' m doing it carefully , conservatively and safely . i started learning about investing because an type recommended italthough he didn' t know me so he told me that i ' m lost and need to find something to live and die for other than my mom( who i ' m taking care for because she has breast cancer )and that she' s a whore which is why i am asexual . i make sex jokes but i ' m not sexual . i don' t judge people for having sex but he says that i ' m missing out( which i ' m really not. . like i can tell him to smoke crack cuz he' s never done itand consequences don' t matter to mei think everyone should be allowed to do whatever the hell they wantthere' s no rules to living ). i don' t like soldiers because they are brainwashed by governments to kill people . he said that i should stay away from religionwell i ' m a pantheist which is like spices up atheismalbert einstein was a pantheist and likely had aspergers and his son had schizophrenia .( interesting stuff eh ? ). i was trolling religious messengers on my hike after i smoked a joint and i was talking about outer space , dmt , shrooms etc which they were uncomfortable with but it was a good day. . cuz they were trying to convert my friend. . so i stook up for her because she was too polite . there' s a billion things that i ' m doing but i like to keep my options open . everyone is lost if they think they know what they' re doing , they' re pretending. . because it' s just ego. . i said to the soldiers , i don' t want to die for anything cuz they were talking about killing people for fun. . bastards. . if an type gets to know me , they like me . many of my friends that are type' s like me but they don' t when they don' t know me . i posted a paradox code on here in a form of satire and someone commented that he didn' t like my avatar . i ' mthat he didn' t know i made a satirical post but that' s what they do. . pick apart people and make responses on what they see. . not the whole picture. . it' s like talking to monkeys that pick out the bugs in each others hair and eat themor i could be wrong. . i ' m almost a genius but not quite because i have low processing speed . also i can' t chase after something that i don' t even really wantwhich is money. . or a nice sports car to impress a mate . the crypto investor type said that i shouldn' t think that way because it' s still spiritual to want money. . i don' t agree . i just feel like i ' m in some simulation where i have to prove myself to others with wealth and get to the toplike how all the rich people are so entitled and often disrespect their maids for example. . idk. . i don' t want to do the same thing that everyone else is doing. . i know that we' re all just colour particles. . trippy universe where god is nothing and everything at the same time. . but i don' t like the word god. . i' ve tripped like a religious mad man on lsd so i can see why people believe what they believe in. . but neither sides have an open mind. . i can' t get into investing for that reason. . looking at numbers. . people commit suicide when their stocks crash and they lose millions which is such a shitty and shallow way to die . maybe i ' m a misanthrope pessimist nihilist but more times than not , i ' m extremely positive and enjoy life . i just don' t like rules and people telling me what to do and how i should live according to society . because society isn' t real . it' s a big social construct that will die with your ego if you smoke a breakthrough dose of dmtand because people haven' t done that , they can be depressed. . and if they don' t but work on themselves and do entrepreneur stuff and stop doing asoul crushing job , they' re still talking down to people. . they don' t want to help. . they pretend to seem like a good person by doing good deeds and giving to charity to make themselves look good but too scared to kill their ego and reveal only soulthe meaning of the word psychedelic means soulrevealing or mindmanifesting."
enfp,"hello fellow types , anyone and everyone . sorry for bugging so many forums for this same question but i ' m trying to pin down this guys mbti( without him taking the test )mellow at first i was thinking maybe he' s a thinker because he' s smart and doesn' t show much feeler in him and maybe extroverted with little introversion because can seem extroverted and i went to many forums to try see if some personalities suit him but they never seem to totally suit him as a person and i know he loves music , its pretty much his passion in life( he plays bass and double bass )i have come to the conclusion that he could have been an type or type but i' ve heard that he sounds more like an type .( or type or type )i reckon he could work with type or type . i just mainly want to know if this sounds like a male type to you and if you are an type male( or know one )would youthey show attraction or friendship as how i have described he treats me .( or even if you know how type males show attraction compared to friendship because i' ve done some reading about type' s and i see that they are the rarest type for a male and can unintentionally make you think they really like you by how they communicate and how they can be kind of unaware as to what they are doing in situations like these. )frustrating be prepared for lots of information to go down your throat !here' s a little description about him he' s really friendly , he love love love loves music( as in playing the bass and has a strong passion towards music ), he likes historywaraction sort of things from what i see and what we have discussed . i found out he likes nebulas from magical stalking( do not blame me , i wanted to see what he liked !)blushed he' s good at maths , i feel like he can seem extroverted but is actually an introvert in a way( i feel he' s more reserved but gives off a more casual vibe . he' s usually somewhat quiet ). everyone seems to love him as a person , and i mean that literally everyone seems to like him . the slacker guys in our classes like him and pretty much everyone in the music program and my friends like him . and he seems more mature than the other guys in our year level . i don' t think he' s competitive , he likes card games and games such as pool . i' ve never seen him upset or mad so i ' m unsure how he deals with that . he seems like a really laid back and casual guy yet could be somewhat organised in his life because i' ve messaged him a few times when he' s preparing something for the next day .( not often )( he usually goes to bed earlier than me i notice but i ' m a night owl so i don' t entirely know )i feel he is somewhat bookish . heres some random things i' ve noticed he does around me which may mean he could be interested in me too ?( this is roughly two years of things that caught my mind )for some reason i use to annoy him a few years ago for no apparent reason( it was more his friend was being weird to me so i would creep them out in a way )i noticed aboutyears ago he started talking to me randomly out of the blue in class . it was the most random thing to ever happen to me , someone talking to me . we' ve worked together on certain projects and usually have one of the best ones in the class and throughout the years and teachers always thought me and him worked well together .( and we do )for a few projects we' ve done it seems like he tends to do most of the work compared to me and usually i do good work . we use to sit together in maths a few times and would seem to distract each other at times and he would help me with my maths . he use to always say hi to me nearly everyday for a few months last year with my name . hi. when he walked past me at some times . i enjoyed that even though i only said hi back and didn' t bring a conversation with him because i ' m kind of useless at conversation in person . in one class where we had to work in partners , two of my only friends in the class were together and the guy offered to make a group with me and his friend . we were having a good time for a few minutes and then the teacher decided to partner me with someone else and he seemed a little sad possibly that i was going to work with someone else but it was for shakespearian insults which is good on someone you don' t particularly like . on the way to music camp he asked to sit next to me on the bus and sat next to me , even though there was aboutpeople going to this( including teachers )on anperson bus and i usually sit alone on the bus because i ' m too shy to ask my friends to sit with me to entertain me . i enjoyed that comfort of him sitting next to me , all though it was a quiet bus ride i was listening to music while he was reading a stephen king novel and i tried to start a conversation about the book and it seemed like an alright short conversation . after that he asked me if he could help carry anything of mine to my cabin and i refused because it was only my luggage , stand , pillow and instrument that wasn' t humongous . i noticed when i saw him in the games room with no one really in there i went in there to see how he would react if we played pool together with him and conversation was short and not the best and afterminutes when my friend showed up he left me to play with her. . one night for dinner at that camp i was feeling very confident because he and my good friends were on the same table and music camp had me in a good mood that night and noticed him talking to one of my newish friends and they seemed to have a good conversation and for some reason after dinner on the table i asked if you would go out with any girl on this table who would you choose .( this is very out of character for me and i felt pretty stupid after saying that but it just kind of came out of my mouth )he responded by telling me that he didn' t want to answer that . he was still friendly to me and didn' t sit next to me on the way back and i was fine with that because a week of music camp pretty much made me exhausted mentally and physically from good friends and music playing and staying up late with said good friends . i think he is sometimes evasive of how he feels and tries to avoid certian situations that involve strong feelings ?( best way i can probably describe it )i feel like he tells me things online that he usually wouldn' t tell people .( he' s told me that he iswas scared of certain things and how some things make him feel and what happened in his day and we have great conversations online usually with funny jokes , how our dayweek has been , he is always the first one to leave the conversation because of either sleeping or shower. )sometimes when i message him it' s like he doesn' t want to talk to me .( which is acceptable and i don' t bug him too often )i feel he' s more of a face to face person because one time when i asked him to play cards against humanity( online version )he said that when playing the online version you don' t really get to see how people react to certain cards and how he would rather play face to face to see how people react and he reckons it' s more fun in person .( i understand what he says but i ' m a lot more confident online than in person )he said merry christmas!. to me on christmas morning randomly atin the morning . i don' t even message my friends merry christmas but this made me feel appreciated . he does similar emoticons to me while chatting such as. so much information has passed . sorry to bring my whole life story of attraction towards a guy onto the forum but i ' m just wanting to know if you feel he is an type and he possibly expresses attraction similar to an type male . i know you really can' t know if someone is attracted to you but i ' m just curious to track his type down to see how to communicate better with him . kitteh"
istp,"what would you say your biggest flaw is ? has this improved for you as you' ve gotten older ? when did you become aware of it , or is it something you' ve always been aware of ? types seem like fairly insightful people , so i ' m curious what everyone' s answers are here . feel free to answer any other types as well."
