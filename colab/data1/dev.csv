intj,<type>s whats your current short term goals   hobbies what things do you want to master or become good at    
infj,there  s this gap in discerning whether my ni idealization fits with the se reality   and oftentimes it falls apart   leading to disappointment because of the unrealistic vision of the grandeur living mostly in the head leads to such troubles   such as constant assumptions   overthinking   and hopeful idealism it  s as if the world is not my world   but rather   a dangerous place i occupy time to time the internal world   the real one   often overexaggerates the information it receives   and this could be a double edged word at the positive note   it has a highly sensitive sensor towards information   resulting in abundant surplus of value from scarce sources of information at the other   it led to a false   and at times   dangerous conclusions let  s give a couple examples   assumptions i tend to assume things   especially about other people  s action   behavior   and thought patterns according to the experiences and fuzzy intuition this can lead to negative thinking   and certain paranoia    enneagram      where perception mismatches with reality   unrealistic ideals of fantasy in order to cope   i had an inclination to rely on certain idealization those visions of idealization often misses its trajectory   because of certain empty information or wrong conclusions this led to constant disappointment with the real world   accompanied by hopeful fantasies where it  s a back and forth between hope and disappointment at times   it even manipulates objects and subjects to match with those ideals these phenomenons of mine are probably caused by mixtures of factors   such as overreliance on abstract theoretical framework   suboptimal coping mechanism   fear of taking action   and inefficient mindset requiring assistance i need your help in order for me to better evolve and adapt with the real world   especially regarding perception x reality mismatching   because no matter what i do   i always have an inclination towards hopeful idealism   abstract overprocessing   and assumptive paranoia thanks in advance 
isfp,i am certain without a doubt i am an xsfp personality type but i am not sure if i am <type> or <type> i will describe myself and hobbies etc and maybe it can help create a more accurate picture of which type i lean more towards i understand they both use the same functions   just slightly different orders i am very passionate about music i am a songwriter and record music myself and it is by far my favorite way i express myself to the world songs can move me deep inside instantly and i can listen to a song on repeat over and over i know whether i like something right away i connect to the overall feel i tend to like moody indie folk pop type music but my taste is very eclectic i love nature and anything being surrounded in dramatic landscapes the forest   coastline   mountains   and open countryside bring me so much peace and happiness it s like i am totally rejuvenated after being in those environments i am highly affected by lighting and sensitive to changes in the immediate environment i am captivated by sunsets i love going for drives or riding my motorcycle something about it just grounds me and helps me feel relaxed and at ease in the world it also allows me to see new sights and take time to reflect which i love   i do enjoy people but i spend a significant time alone   not always by choice but by the nature of my lifestyle and job etc i am very independent by nature   and do most things alone something i have always enjoyed doing is people watching i love to analyze what is happening around me i am very passionate with my beliefs and values if i see someone either violating those   or not respecting mine   it is an instant turn off for me and i do not have any desire to create connection with that person any longer i am a huge advocate for treating others with kindness and compassion   and listening to others and validating their opinions and beliefs regardless if ours don t align that being said   i can be very outgoing and life of the party in some situations especially with close friends or family   but also very quiet and reflective too depending on the mood i am in when there is too much stimuli around me   i can get rather frazzled and overloaded i am sensitive to energy around me this is me in a nutshell   let me know what you think   
entj,if there  s one personality type that i  ll never understand unless i ask someone who has the type personally about how they act and what their thought processes looked like   it  s you guys   the <type>s i do n t understand why i can grasp every single type that does n t have ni as their dominant or auxiliary function   especially auxiliaries   probably due to a lack of ni based knowledge because i know so little about you guys   i can only really use stereotypes and blanket statements as of now stereotypes such as cruelly and coldly efficient plan makers   but that does n t fit right with me no matter how much i try and convince myself so   basically   what makes an <type> tick    what do you strive for    how are you like around others    what  s your take on your extraversion    how does an inferior fi work with you guys    tertiary se    what  s something you look most forward to in life       do n t answer all of these   i got a little sidetracked and just kept coming up with questions to ask      thanks   
istp,hello   i recently joined the site and have been really impressed with the level of insight shared on this forum i was hoping someone could help me with a <type> i just met my employer recently hired a new college graduate       years old    to fill a vacancy and subsequently my boss asked me to train i am a    year old male <type> and after getting to know him over the past month of training i am confident he is a <type> we share similar hobbies and interests and just two days ago he invited me along to one of his hiking expiditions i was really on the fence about how well he liked me as he is hard to read since the invite   he and i both have begun to share a lot more detail about our daily lives something he for any other person gives a typical <type> generic answer if asked what brings me here looking for an answer revolves around how this particular <type> stares at me for the past week   as i pass by him   i catch him out of the corner of my eye staring at me only me he does not do this towards others and has little interest in how others in the room are behaving yet   it is like he watches my every move with his head tilted just enough to see me so he could turn quickly if needed he is a bit immature still and thinks he is being slick when he does this when i naturally turn in his direction   he quickly adjusts his head like he had no idea i was there and his facial expression is really weird when he does this with his mouth slightly open interestingly as of late   he has started to not pull away and we lock eyes face to face admittedly   i too stare at times at people i am trying to size up however   how this <type> stares is unlike anything i have ever encountered as my feeling trait tells me his overall body language does not correlate like he is trying to read me then today   i again noticed through a reflection on a piece of glass he was staring at me a few moments later he mumbled and asked me over to his work station for some help we work in a lab and he needed to transfer some acid he asked if i would do it mind you   he has far more academic experience at this than i do the task at hand did not at all need two people but i happily obliged in fact   he had done a similiar task earlier today without me while i was in the pouring process   he then proceeded to place his hand on the glass container to pour the solution with me i do n t like to be touchy at all with someone unless i know them and this really made me uncomfortable as it just simply caught me off guard if this had been any other coworker i would not even thought twice about it i felt like he artificially created the task just to get near me i have read about how a <type> can gaze but i was hoping someone could shed some light on why an <type> stares secretly when they are not upset i hate to talk myself up but i am usually good at reading body language but he leaves me so perplexed as to his motives am i overthinking this and was he just trying to study me    was this a poor social attempt using his physical instinct to create a situation to try to bond    or perhaps he has a sexual attraction towards me    if so   i read my <type> personality is not one they typically like i am curious to understand why an <type> would secretly stare 
intj,i m new here and i just read this somewhere clothing there  s generally two lines of clothing <type>s follow one   mentioned on the <type> fashion thread is largely utilitarian black    or dark    t shirt   jeans or cargo pants for females minimal jewelry few advertisements i follow this trend to the letter the few i know in reality wear light colored clothing   but essentially the same thing every day this light clothing is still cold colors    blue    whatever the case   clothing stays consistent and avoids drawing attention i actually laughed that  s like the opposite of what i wear what do you guys wear    
istp,as i have said before   people wanting to know more about how cognitive functions work   will benefit from going to practical typing ryan    confirmed <type>    and mara    confirmed <type> type    put a lot of analysis into their articles eliminating the bias from other systems of thought recently mara gave her thoughts on how ixtp types use extraverted feeling here is what she had to say   inferior fe users are anti marketing for <type>s and <type>s   the pure logic or legitimacy of the idea should reign supreme these types are willing to pursue any idea or thought that might be true   regardless of the implications however   once they discover what they deem to be true   they don t want to have to dumb it down for you    bear in mind   i m not saying these types are inherently smart i m speaking from their perspective    practically speaking   this means that an ixtp that produces a novel idea will innately struggle that idea of marketing that idea to others   beyond relaying or demonstrating the pure rationale of the idea stereotypically   this is why you see the genius inventor always teaming up with a business partner the inventor usually lacks the business sense   and needs the partner   yet often struggles with the tactics utilized by the business partner in an ixtp s ideal world   all they should have to do is explain what they produced or thought of   and people should automatically get it and see it s value if the idea or product is good   it should thrive without any social effort   inferior fe users dismiss the value of connections high extraverted judgers    fjs or tjs    typically recognizes the value in utilizing the system to their advantage this often includes the people in it remember the saying   it s not what you know it s who you know    <type>s and <type>s by default want to rise through the ranks purely on their own skill   knowledge or merit they don t want to have to cater to others   make themselves likeable   etc that s not to say they won t want friends or won t be personable   but in their minds   none of that should matter in a professional sense or be rooted in a long term success strategy these types have a strong independent streak social connections are not something they ll want to go out of their way to form   inferior fe users may dismiss the value of credentials sometimes official education    which typically results in credentials of some kind    is necessary to learn a trade or profession other times   one can learn a skill without going through any official program however   many people value credentials they like to see it as proof of the person s expertise or legitimacy so   in many cases   it s valuable to collect credentials to bolster your personal marketability this is a concept that <type>s and <type>s may innately struggle with after all   like i mentioned in the previous point   they believe their skill knowledge should speak for itself the concept of gaining credentials for the sake of currying favor or earning legitimacy will frustrate them and feel like a frivolous waste of time   inferior fe users can fail to infuse emotional value into their work inferior feelers are often disconnected from their own emotions and emotions in general to some degree as a result   many inferior feelers struggle to connect with people in a deep   meaningful   or intimate way however   another aspect of the feeling function is it s focus on emotional value people like to relate the feeling functions    and thus   feelers    to values   but technically every individual has values    feeling vs thinking what are values       the feeling functions specifically deal with the personal   emotional   and social implications of values so   getting back to inferior fe   the struggle that an <type> or <type> may have is infusing value into their work in such a way that other people will find it valuable or relatable   inferior fe users have anxiety concerning social protocol   not social anxiety in general ok   here s where i ve often gotten inferior fe wrong many people suffer from social anxiety an ixtp s anxiety is more specific than that an ixtp who is starting to develop their inferior fe   or at the very least   has not suppressed it   will simultaneously feel aware of   yet blind to   social protocol in other words   they know it s there   and that it should be adhered to   but they don t know how to do that if the ixtp doesn t care to make any kind of impact or find their role in society   then this awareness may not matter to them they ll avoid scenarios that are too cumbersome   and make friends that don t emotionally or socially pressure them    people   generally speaking   may not actually be a source of stress    however   the anxiety will kick in when their inferior fe begins developing enough to give them a desire to make a social impact or find where they belong in the quote above   carl jung said   he is none the less beset by the greatest anxiety if ever he has to make it an objective reality this anxiety is specific to when ti dominants want to take their ideas knowledge and implement them within reality    in other words   contribute to society    they re aware of their struggle to make a social impact and emotionally connect with others   but feel compelled on some level to share their ideas or abilities with the world in that area   they feel inferior   and fear rejection or failure because of this inadequacy    yet   the very idea that they could be successful if they simply found a way to adapt whatever they re capable of contributing stirs up some level of disdain within themselves because their work in it s purest form should be good enough    click to expand i omitted some personal experiences mara shares in the article if you want see what she has to say   you can read the article in its entirety here besides after reading the article   like me i think you will be able to conjure up your own experiences from inferior use of fe enjoy

estj,so   most other forums has one like this   but i could n t find one here    think we  ll need one regarding all the stereotypes here    so guys    and girls      just go on and shoot any questions you  d like      other <type>s are welcome to answer as well of course   but i guess you do n t need an invitation for that    
enfp,what questions would you like to ask your future self if you were to meet them    if you don t want to ask them any questions   would you be interested in conversing with them at all    why or why not    sent from my iphone using tapatalk
infp,when is the last time you felt like you were enough as you were    that you weren t fundamentally lacking something    why did you think that situation or moment made you feel that    
intj,which type usually respects the <type> finds the <type> interesting    which type does n t usually like the innate traits that come along with the <type>    
infj,i thought this would be a fun discussion to see what people say what are some clear signs that you  re an <type>       
entp,i do n t smoke   i m not interested in becoming addicted to nicotine but i ca n t lie   epipemods com these are cool   and the vapors smells good when i m around other people like candy i  d be tempted to get one of those pipes and nicotine free vaper juice if i were n t concerned about the toxicity of inhaling that stuff the vegetable glycerin and distilled water seem to be harmless enough and the p glycol or whatever is supposedly harmless as well since it is in asthma inhalers is this true    the flavorings though    even if the above is true   the flavorings seems to be a wild card because apparently there are foods that   when inhaled   cause damage like fake popcorn butter which is supposedly used in vaper cigarettes i do n t know any of you out there have experience in this    i love cotton candy   and if i could inhale it without making myself sick    hehehe    with one of those sick pipes    hehehe    also   do you have to inhale it into your lungs    could n t you just suck on it like a cigar seems like you should still be able to taste it if you keep it in your mouth   and that would be safer since the concern with some of these ingredients is not how they digest but how they affect the lungs edit just found a site that said vaping is more enjoyable if you do n t inhale but hold it in your mouth instead so ugh i might start vaping smoking nicotine free candy lol edit   just thinking   i live in cancer alley next to   oil refineries   a sugar refinery   close to a coffee plant   etc should i really be worried about the chemicals in an vaping device    
istp,hey guys so i m pretty sure i m either an <type> or an <type> but i do n t know which of the two can anyone explain to me they key differences by providing some examples everywhere i look answers are given in a very theoretical matter which only confuses me thanks in advance also if you want to ask me something to help you determine which one i am   i m up for that if it  s of any help   the two results i get the most on enneagram are   and   and i can say that while   sounds a lot like my young teen self     is much more fitting for me now in my   s 
istp,so i got thinking   again <type>s are known as the rebel types we very rarely conform to any particular norm and when we even sense that we are we immediately rebel against it we do things against others wishes we do n t care for most people in general and we generally do n t like being controlled does that mean are actions are spiteful in nature as most of our actions are in effect rebellious against the norm    can we really be detached completely from petty emotions when we take these actions    and what if we are n t aware of it    
esfj,i have n t seen any on here and i m pretty curious about them do they just never go online
