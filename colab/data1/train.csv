esfp,during the school year i have been unofficially tutoring one of the elementary students that live in my neighborhood i  ve typed her as an <type> i could use some advice on discipline and or motivation in light of some recent problems for context   i am an <type> and am doing this in a friendly   neighborly kind of way sorry for the long post will highlight the key points so here are the issues academic she is now in the  th grade   but reads at the  st grade level    her parents do not speak english   so i suspect that in the early years a lack of attention to fundamental phonics has played a role    she cannot sound words out very well   and usually just guesses words based on whatever the first letter is    for example she would see the word basement and say basketball    english spelling is notoriously inconsistent   but hers is downright atrocious it pains me to see her ask for spelling to simple words like where she has very poor focus and usually cannot finish one question without going off on a tangent based on whatever random idea or memory has popped into her head i have resorted to using a timer to add pressure for her to keep working a worksheet that should take no more than    minutes takes nearly an hour and a half to complete she is a fun loving child   so i sometimes indulge her in her little side convos during reading comprehension multiple choice answers   she goes down the line guessing which answer may be correct   looking at my facial expression to gauge behavioral she is extremely sensitive to criticism and downright avoidant i offer praise whenever she tries and answers things correctly   but occasionally i will mention a systemic problem to her   and she becomes defensive she will do anything not to hear criticism   including suddenly needing a drink of water   needing to go to the bathroom   changing the subject   etc sometimes i let her do arts and crafts at my house she has become so entitled to my art supplies that she thinks she needs to leave my house with a gift every time she visits this includes her constantly asking can she have markers or cute knick knacks she finds around my home i have a pile of paper that i reserve for little drawings and random notes she asks if she can take two sheets home i say yes   minutes later she wants two more sheets it  s almost opportunistic   like she feels she has to constantly finagle more i have resorted to saying no more and more these days as i truly want her to understand that just because something is cute   does not mean that you are entitled to it she is a sweet girl   really values her friendships and playing she never runs out of energy to play the problem is   no matter how much i give   it  s never enough recently she asked if she could come over my house every day after school   and on the days that i am busy if i can call her and tell her that i have something else to do and let her know what is the something else woops   she    and possibly her parents at this point    are stepping into dangerous territory i m a freedom loving <type>   i do n t feel a need to be busy just the simple fact that i am an unpaid volunteer and she is not my child is enough for me to pump the brakes on that i do n t care if i have no plans at all i would never willingly schedule away my personal time every weeknight for the entire school year furthermore   she takes this kind of social rejection personally and starts to feel unloved in this case   i will notice her retaliating by acting cold or playing dumb while saying intentionally hurtful things this post has gotten long now   but if anyone has any ideas   tips   or tricks about any part of it   please let me know i feel myself growing resentful   which is n t a good relationship dynamic for a child if she were an adult   i would start my <type> slow fade   but she is very young and i think some behaviors can be corrected with insight 
intp,thread exists in the <type> <type> sections and seems to have been a rather useful addition   kudos to thewaffle any type can ask a question   and they will be answered by the <type>s science questions work too or the other kinds of questions any kind of questions shoot   
esfj,hi i m an <type> girl in my   s and just had a first date with an <type> guy in his   s we met on a dating app and have been talking for almost a month now he is a very busy guy and his texting style since the first has been the same   only twice a day    mornings evenings    and if i got lucky it would be   times a day but whenever he replies   just like other <type>s   he shows kindness   care   and being supportive then he asked me to meet for a coffee we talked for about       hours before he had to go because of work and charity projects when talking he seems like carefully using his expression like he  s setting up his image i could tell because i think he actually can be more expressive   you know he offered to drive me home and at the end he told me to say hi to my family for him i know that it  s just one day since that happened but during or after the date he has n t mentioned about the probability of going to a second date i texted him after date saying i had a great time and he replied kindly without any hints about our dates or how he feels about that idk if i should just forget about it   or should i text him to ask about his intention do you think he wants this to happen    sincerely   overthinking <type>
enfp,i wonder if i will just keep this thread up and fish for it every time i meet a new <type> feel free to add your own description when you guys meet one too i see from     patients a day now    used to be more but the appointments are now longer i m not a doctor i m a diabetes educator dietitian   btw    anyway   i just met another <type> and i think i will keep writing and describing us this particular gal was so quick so quick that the actual things i needed to teach her    which are complex concepts    took about    th of the time i went to re hash everything like i usually do   because usually it takes a few repetitions and i could tell she had it but the conversation all the things she was talking about took loads of time this particular girl s ne combined with what i think would often be called adhd she cannot get enough info she is constantly learning new things   doing art   cooking and taking care of her family it seems like she could have even handled a great deal more if anyone was able to give that many concepts that fast   then i think she would be the quickest person to get a ph d if anyone taught that way and tried to put something they have ever learned in fast track i gotta say nobody has ever come close to learning as fast in my office but at the same time talked so much but it s not like it wasn t relevant i think it s just more than what most people usually do in a given space of time she said she s just barely gotten onto an adhd drug    she was never really diagnosed    and says instead of looking for her keys three times in an hour each morning it s now down to once progress she knows nothing about mbti   but it was really fun to see she was very sweet and also has been through the wringer with her health she has a rare diseases and has had a major organ transplant   so there was a lot to do   but the education   like i said   was a breeze the amount of into she brought to tie into what we were discussing was impressive it made the conversation different to manage than the average human being or even than the average <type> it was fun   and i m cheering for her   she does so much   much more than the average person in a day one other thing she was able to ask questions that were conceptual based on the ones that i explained i m glad when people can just put it to use well done   <type> oh and i forgot also   in a class i was teaching today    a new group each time      there was an <type> man and he knew how to ask such good conceptual questions that i couldn t help it   i basically told the core and over view of what was happening in the body right upfront when he asked   and it s more complex than i usually go for this class   but to my mind even though everybody else had gone silent it helped explain everything that we were then going to talk about and a lot of people enjoyed that class today so i think after i repeated a few of those concepts with examples later   it made a big impact after the class   he actually gave me info on something i ve been looking for in the community for years so he got to the heart of everything fast loved it   he got excited to hear it all and so i did too 
infj,i feel my best when i can engage in all my functions   especially fe it can be tempting to be stuck with ni ti over analysis that tend to go nowhere now   when i do some self expression   or something emotional related   it could be writing   improving emotional atmosphere   a loose and enjoyable company   that  s where i felt really happy of course   this is a conclusion based on theory   and all humans need this   but even then   i find this really euphoric for the sake of theory   though   it  s me engaging with fe sure   this ni ti  s aha moment are transcending   but it can be enhanced further when it could be applied   and validated through fe as its output channel however   i  ve been unhealthy most of the time   especially with anxiety and doubts and ni ti   or basically just my introverted state   when stuck for too long   could be really unethical and irritable i want to go out there and have fun without limiting myself let  s say   theoretically   my fe se are starving   but realistically   i need more goddamn enjoyable social interaction where i can be myself without having to limit myself    fear    because   like      of my social interactions in college is just me putting a mask let  s say   my cs major is full of nt  s and i have to put in logical facade and to compete    ni ti focus    anyway   i digress writing is a good start   but when it comes to real life social interactions   street smarts   public speaking   i m just a toddler lmao how to improve fe overall   and to engage with complete immersion    my biggest problem always lies in fear   especially hesitation   due to superego audience judgmental criticism 
istj,dear brethren <type>s   i am hopelessly crushing on a friend of a friend i m    and a widow   but i feel like a teenager right now so far   i ve only been around him three times   in the context of a social gathering that the mutual friend arranges without cutie there   i m bubbly and assertive and relaxed with the others he shows up   and i get awkward and silent and stare at my shoes typical <type> reaction he s very nice to everyone   including me   and i m just sitting there tongue tied and staring at the freckles on his arms   mentally recording what he says and the shape of his eyebrows and the color of his shoe laces   to journal in detail when i get home yes   i even walked up to his truck in the dark parking lot   to see what his birth month was on the license plate    may    this past weekend   two of the gang    <type> and <type>    both asked with concern whether i was feeling all right or something bad had happened to me   because i was sitting there like a lump   not smiling   silent   and looking down at the floor well   <type> had taken my seat when i went to the bathroom so that she could talk to the person next to me   and so when i got back   i had to take her seat   which was directly in front of cutie   i was paralyzed him what city in country of childhood did you grow up in    me um   uh to add a layer of complexity   i ve typed him as <type>   so he has that easygoing physicality that <type>s have   a very physical presence without doing or saying anything i feel overwhelmed by both my feelings for him and by his physical presence bottom line if you ve had a relationship with someone you first crushed on   how did you get over the overwhelm and social paralysis    he s single and in an appropriate age group for me   and i m not in a hurry   but i would like to get to know him better   slowly like an <type> or a tortoise   which would be impossible if i m a petrified statue every time he s in the room this did not come up when i met my late husband   because i did not have a crush on him and we were friends first without me suspecting that i d develop feelings for him later will i ever feel comfortable around this guy    does an <type> crush ever morph into a relationship    how did you get over the paralysis

esfj,hello <type>s   in this part   of the group interview with all types that have extroverted feeling   introverted thinking   extroverted intuition   and introverted sensing in their function stack   we discussed how each type use nt    ne ti    consume rose    <type>      isaac    <type>      julie    <type>      emily    <type>      and andreas    <type>    talked about how they each individually use sf blast during this final part of this interview   isaac talked about sf blast being a double edged sword yes   you can get people to behave better and he talked about shushing people who were n t paying attention to the teacher when he was younger at the same time   the sf part of sf blast made isaac aware that it  s not cool to be shushing people so he made sure to respect the sf part later on rose used to make rude chaotic t shirts when she was younger which was very sf cool andreas does the whole rapping thing and he  s also the biggest blaster in this group probably because he is saviour di and is not as hesitant to blast even though isaac and rose have double activated blast emily uses sf blast to troll people and julie uses sf blast to be the controller in her family since her husband is even more chaotic than her watch this group interview here 
istj,so i continue to chug away at dating i go on dates and none of them end up badly with her storming off or tossing a drink at me but i just constantly get the no chemistry not feeling it the thing is i never feel this instant lightning bolt spark type reaction it is more like i am attracted which is n t a big thing i am attracted to about    of women in my age race bracket as i get to know them as a person it builds more and more and i start getting a picture of building a life together how was it when you fell in love    was it like an instant spark    
enfj, edited desperate <type> needs help understanding love of my life   <type> i am an <type> who has been in love with an <type> for almost twenty years and i still do n t have him i wonder if i  ve made every mistake that it  s possible for an <type> to make and i need help understanding what  s going on we grew up together and from childhood i felt a connection with him it was as if i understood the deepest part of him in a way that no one else did and when he looked at me   i felt he understood me   too in our teens   lightning struck our eyes would connect   the world would fade away   and it was just he and i in a crowded room i  ve never felt that with anyone else but i was too young to realize what it meant we never did anything about it   moved on   grew up   and i married someone else he dated other people but never married for several years   i did n t see him and yet   i never forgot him it was as if he were a part of me my soulmate i was happily married content but at night   sometimes i would dream about him i would go months without a thought of him and then i would have a dream and i would think of him for days usually i dreamed that i was searching for him but i could never find him or if i found him   he never saw me i came to believe that there was a connection between us that was unexplainable and i would just have to live with it i went on with my life and tried to bury his memory deep inside last year   my life changed i discovered my husband was cheating an intensely loyal <type>   i was devestated i mourned and grieved and started to rebuild my life six months ago   i saw my <type> again for the first time in all these years it was like magic   all over again we sat and talked and he opened himself up to me in a way that i am only just beginning to realize was pretty special he  s always been the life of the party   the funny guy   but i  ve always seen beneath that to the serious   deep   real man that he is i was blown away i fell even deeper in love   but for absolutely real this time call it the hopeless romantic <type> part of me   but if i  ve loved him this long and it  s only getting deeper   i ca n t imagine loving anyone else we began to text and email and carry on a long distance something we talked about deep stuff real stuff fun stuff not every day but enough that we stayed in each other  s lives for the next two months on a regular basis usually he initiated the online conversations we would sometimes chat for two hours without saying anything very meaningful or important we were just completely comfortable and natural with each other after two months   i began to feel that he was pulling back the <type> in me quickly retreated i became scared and i was already so deeply in love   i did n t know what to do to be fair   he was very busy typical <type>   he was never home on any given night but was always busy doing with his hands in about a dozen pies but i felt like he was rejecting me my intuition told me he was pulling back i wondered if it was too much   too fast i decided to leave him alone i was n t sure what was going on and began to feel that he was blowing hot and cold because he would still occasionlly seek me out online but he never called me on the phone or did anything that was overtly flirty i began to go back over his behavior toward me i was n t convinced he viewed me any differently than any of his other friends he had never given me any indication that he viewed me romantically the last time i had seen him   he continued to joke and laugh and treat me like everyone else and yet   there was a subtle difference when he was around me if i caught him unawares   came upon him when he was n t expecting me   his eyes gave him away there was an expression in them that caught at me   made me lose my breath like his soul looking into mine it killed me hooked me there were other things   too i had noticed that when we first met again   he refused to look into my eyes at all he would talk to me or rather at me   but would n t make eye contact if he did   it was a glancing blow it was so obvious that i had begun to wonder if maybe i was wrong and he was n t really an extrovert   but was really shy instead but that did n t add up with everyone else   he was completely natural and confident it was only with me that he was different and   when i thought about it   he had acted this way right before i married my husband years before and there was always   always this tension within me when he was around   as if i were hyper aware of him i intuitively felt like he felt it   too   but wondered if i was imagining it i also noticed that he never hugged me never   ever but he hugged everyone else in a friendly   affectionate way that seemed to be a part of his personality just not me i was n t included i had even started to wonder if there was something wrong with me that he did n t want to hug me over the next four months   our contact became less and less i became desperate and yet determined not to beg i wanted him to come to me   if he wanted me and yet   if he wanted me even a little   i would have been willing to beg i just wanted him but i did n t know how to get him or if he even wanted me at all i began to wonder if i had made a serious mistake by pulling back i had thought he was playing games but i began to wonder if maybe he just had n t thought i was interested i had guarded my heart closely because i was afraid he would n t want it what if he thought i did n t want his    if i were honest   i had to admit that i had carefully treated him like a friend when everything inside of me had been dying for him about a month and a half ago   i saw him again i was still deeply certain that he did n t love me   that i was destined to live my life desperately loving him and pretending that i did n t and so   i closed down my deepest emotions and pretended that i was perfectly calm and he was just a dear   treasured friend there were no lingering glances   no accidental touches but still he sought me out i told myself he was seeking out the entire group of friends but he sat next to me   often i felt torn   emotionally chaotic   absolutely certain one moment that he felt the same way for me and then just as certain the next that he did n t finally   he caught me alone in a quiet moment and started to ask the deep questions   the kind that we had once shared so freely but i could n t share it was awkward and painful and i was in love with him and wanted all of him and so i shared very little this time   when i left   he hugged me it was n t a friendly   arms around shoulders hug that he gives everyone else it was closer   intimate i was the one to pull away   certain still that he viewed me as a friend it was only later that i started to wonder he told me specifically to keep in touch with him i   trying to protect my heart   told him just as specifically that he could contact me if he wanted to he told me that he had n t seen me online lately and he seemed awkward   hesitant   unsure i did n t know what this meant i had felt that he did n t want to talk to me as much and so i had n t been as available to him online but he could have called me if he had wanted to he had my number but he never had i was n t sure that i bought his reason but the way he looked at me   it was almost as if he blamed me for our lack of communication i was confused and did n t know what to think that night   i took a chance and texted him about how much i had enjoyed seeing him he immediately texted back   asking if i was home i said no and he texted back that we would talk soon and that he was n t very busy over the next week i thought   ok   i  ve done my part   and i did n t reply and just waited i waited for a month out of the blue two weeks ago   he contacted me again   wanted to know how i was doing and told me a little bit about his busy life we chatted online for an hour and then i initiated the goodbye   told him i loved talking with him but had to go the truth is   i could have sat up all night talking to him and i do n t want to be that girl   i m so confused by him that i do n t know if he wants me or not my <type> intuition says yes   but my <type> need to protect myself says maybe not why is n t he being bolder if he truly wants me    is he just being nice to me because i m a friend who  s gone through a rough time    or is he an <type> who  s afraid of my rejection    i will tell you that my intuition says he  s in love with me but my logical brain keeps making me doubt because he  s never actually done anything that could be considered romantic should i take a chance    should i open up more and be more vulnerable with him or should i just continue to wait    thank you in advance for your advice 
entp,hi all people it is about that the truth about mbti first post discussing intelligence and type if we

estj,hello <type>s   in this interview   i got a chance to talk to daniel about what it  s like to be an <type> jumper te ne pc s    b    ff first   daniel talked about loving his fi and doing fi all day long however   if the tribe comes around and asks for help   he said he feels responsible to help them because his play is nt   he likes to solve problems with the tribe in a collaborative way because he has trouble using his st blast   he rather show the tribe how to do something than teach them or tell them how to do something daniel being nt play is also very prominent as he told me several clever nt jokes for example   he said when someone says something to him hurtful   he will pretend it did n t hurt him but in reality   it  s like him being a grass pokemon weak to a fire pokemon their attacks    words    would be super effective on him he also talks about being energy dominant and being balanced with his energy levels because he is an exxj exxp   he does get bored of routines quickly and wants to channel change making sticking to a workout or diet difficult for him daniel also talked about his fear of judgement as an exxj and how making friends was something that was tough when he was younger because he was picky with people but was also grateful when he was older when another tribe adopted him to join their group watch this interview here 
istj,hello i recently got a book from our library about analyzing handwriting   and wanted to share a description i found accurate for myself a special situation called secondary expansion is where the letters themselves are narrow but the spaces in between them are wide on the surface the writer appears to be outgoing   but inside she shrinks away from social contact yet despite her insecurity and shyness   she pushes herself to interact   at least in groups where she knows the people we call this type of person a converted introvert because while it is n t natural to her   she  s learned how to behave as an extrovert in social situations the complete idiot  s guide to handwriting analysis   second edition sheila lowe i find this extremely interesting because that description is pretty close to the way i behave in school   and matches my handwriting style almost perfectly if you do n t mind   a description of your handwriting and type would be pretty sweet to see if handwriting analysis is basically accurate thank you   
istp,the first time i took the mistype investigator test   i was typed as an <type> the second time   i was classified as an <type> with low ni i  ve taken the test twice   once before breaking my laptop and again after punching some loser in the face and breaking his jaw i want to know why the same test is showing different scores   despite being praised for its accuracy my big five score is an scoai regardless   and i am a clear social extrovert who likes to engage with others 
istj,so i am a   m <type> chemist i fit most of the textbook descriptions of an <type> except i am not as organized and detail oriented as i would like to be   not really as stubborn   in romance i really need to warm up to someone first though some of the descriptions read like by the   th date i finally made a move and touched her hand hopefully kiss by the   th i am primarily relying on old i do n t go to many places where i meet women in real life i a pursuing women my age       without kids    do n t have do n t want    my dating history is nearly nonexistent i am not particularly sensitive to women  s attractiveness and most women are sufficiently attractive to me it is n t my primary criteria i think a biggest problem i am encountering is i just do n t know how to tease   banter   and flirt i have conversations ask questions   listen but in the end i often get told no chemistry my default state is kind of mr spock any tips    i have watched a lot of youtube videos and am envious of the natural charm those guys are able to exhibit but do n t feel i can do it effectively and genuinely 
estp,ok   simply speaking it would be <type>   however all of the <type>s i know do not feel like my opposite at all i clash most   or shall i say i feel most opposite with <type> which personality would you say you think most opposite to you    why would you consider this personality as the opposite    
infp,i wish women wanted to have casual sex with me according to what i  ve read   women who say they do n t want casual sex will happily forego their morals if the guy is hot enough so i guess i m just not hot enough which breaks my heart i wish women found me hot personally   if i was to go into a relationship   i would be more picky    about looks    more picky about looks    than i would be with respect to casual sex    you  re asking me to devote my whole life to this woman    so of course i want her to be smoking hot but if it  s a nsa situation   then she still has to be hot    i m still picky   i confess      but she does n t have to be a total smoking hot babe it  s not like i m gonna devote my life to her or something it  s just casual   no strings attached but according to what i  ve read   women are apparently the opposite in terms of casual sex   they just want the guy to be hot they do n t care about personality but if she  s looking for a relationship   she might be willing to date an ugly guy   as long as he makes up for it in other traits so   as they say   any guy can get a relationship but casual sex   only the really hot guys can get that i worry if i ever get a girlfriend    probably too late for that too   anyway      then maybe she does n t find me sexually physically attractive maybe she  s only with me for my  sweet and dependable nature  or whatever i do n t get her panties wet   unlike those exciting   sexy bad boys she did casual sex with in her past i merely appeal to her logic i m an apple nobody wants to eat an apple those muscular bad boys were her ice cream ice cream is tempting it makes your mouth watery it tempts your emotions the apple does not there  s nothing tempting about the apple but logically   you know the apple is better for you long term so you force yourself to like it but really   you do n t like it emotionally   it does n t satisfy you it only appeals to your cold logic because the ice cream    the exciting   sexy bad boys    treat you badly in the long term so you force yourself to buy the apple but you really do n t like it you hate it i do n t wanna be apple zoned i wanna be the ice cream to women and studies have shown that women are attracted to muscular men   with respect to short term flings but in terms of long term relationships   they do n t find the muscular men trustworthy so they do n t date them long term i wish women wanted to have casual sex with me any old fat   hairy   muscle less   jaw less guy like me can get a relationship but casual sex   that  s another story i wish women wanted to have casual sex with me that  s the only way i would feel flattered and attractive and sexually desired 
intp,i thought that we could use a thread like this i know there is a confessions thread   but that  s not quite the same   and we have n t had a proper <type> madness thread    which is my reading of stream of consciousness    since the crush thread and it  s ill begotten clones were banished to the land of winds and ghosts    also known as spam world    so    copying from the original    take issue with something going on in society    having a bad day    have something on your mind that wont go away    experience something so fabulous you just have to express it    accidentally sold your mother to a pimp in a back alley game of poker    have an idea   or discover something so amazing you must tell everyone    post your vent    or experience   idea   etc    here   note    s    this thread is not for venting about other members   the moderators   or the forum do n t over spam the thread    i ca n t expect <type>s not to spam a least a little    lest it be sent screaming into the spam abyss 
istj,my bestie is <type> t   i m <type> t and one of her closest friend is <type> a is it weird that <type>s are close to <type>s    what can attract us    we are childhood friend   my first one    we were already together in kindergarten   and when i went away for health issues she was really sad and had difficulties with other children she said it to me    i feel her as a cute   strong   clever   stubborn   kind and perfectionist girl   the one i can always trust i asked her what she thinks about me and she only said you are you   you should know who you are she doesn t give many explanations   she opens while talking and not asking but she cares   i see with actions so   i was curious about what can help a friendship between an <type> and an <type> do you have <type>s friends    
infp,do you sometimes feel like you are being interrogated and that you  re personal space has been intruded on when someone asks you a normal   harmless question or comment    for example   in college   i had a friend who would always point something out about me if i got a new pair of shoes   she would say oh you got a new pair of shoes and then tell me her opinion of them well   i m sure to a lot of people this would just seem normal but for some reason   i felt like i was being interrogated and that my personal space was being invaded i do n t know why i felt that way it might have something to do with the fact that i do n t usually make casual remarks like that about other people and thier appearance of whatever the case may be i guess i feel like it  s none of my business so for example   if someone i know gets a new hairstyle   i most likely wo n t make a comment about it   whether i feel like the hairstyle looks nice or not i usually just keep my opinion to myself 
isfp,hello <type>s   i m here to ask a question on the cognitive functions stacking of your type because i m going through a typing crisis i  ve typed myself as <type> for a long time   but i  ve started to have doubts mainly because of two functions se and te as for se   the problem is that my se seems to be nonexistent i do n t live in the present but rather in my own head   i m not really spontaneous and ca n t live in the moment   and when i try to do that    which is usually when i m drunk   as i find it hard to let myself go otherwise    it ends up being a mess and chaotic more than anything else the problem with te is that it seems to work better than my se i m not the type of person to plan every little thing   but at the same time i m no airhead who ca n t get things done i can indeed be organized and efficient when i need to be    i was described as a war machine on my job   which is in the research field for context      because as long as i can do things my own way   i have no problem with deadlines and time management and all that stuff i like to have a general plan for my day just to have a general idea of where i m going while still keeping it flexible nor am i extremely emotional to the point of not being able to hold back judgement when i need to   i know when it is the moment to express myself and when i need to shut up i also do n t really see myself in inferior te problems and a fi ni loop makes no sense because i  ve been like this my whole life and not just for some period of time the only thing i m sure about is that ni and fi and my highest functions and everything else around that makes no sense do any of you <type>s relate to this   and or have an explanation    i do n t know if it can help or influence anything   but in enneagram i m a  w         or        so sx 
entp,hello   i have never met an <type> personally but from the things i read it seems possible what are your opinions    
intj,met an <type> and the conversation went ongoing frequently they asked me a lot of questions    mostly about my interests   what i do   etc etc    and i tried my best to respond to all of them however   they often suddenly changed the topic after i responded to their question and asked about something else about me when i made a comment of something like for example   right it s so easy to do that   or just a remark about what they said like i agree it s so hard to do that they practically bombarded me with questions that it felt like an interview after that kept going i answered another question of theirs and the conversation suddenly stopped there with them leaving me on read   so i freaked out wondering if i said something bad and quickly told them it was fun talking to them and they read that as well i know i might be overthinking   but i just got curious can you guys tell me general signs    thanks
isfp,right where to begin i met an <type> girl and she has either brought out the <type> in me or made me hate the <type> in me we went out and i felt like an <type> she broke things off and now i feel like an <type> but i hate the feeling either way she  s fucked up my fi and i feel very shitty very intensely at times and i ca n t control my feelings a year ago i took many tests and    of the time   out of like    tests i was typed as an <type>   i even bought please understand me   and yeah <type> lately   over the past   months i  ve been feeling different   very emotional and so i took the test again in the book <type> <type> took a   are you an <type> or <type> test and was <type> i then realised that   holy shit   of course i m an <type> what a fucking idiot i  ve been all this time    but then i read descriptions and the   you know you  re a xxxx when    threads and well i related to the <type> the most and i just ca n t decide at times i  ll realise that i m an se user but feel like i would prefer to have ne instead and then when i think i m an <type> i would think    shit   you live in the moment   you want to live in the moment and you do you little bastard   decide already what your type is      i  ll be honest i m a bit of a lost soul at times   definitely a p definitely a fi dominant i think i might be an <type> because the <type> uses the same functions and the tests recognised those functions in me but in the wrong order or am i an <type> but just been fucked up by this girl    what do you think    i  ll tell you more if the info is n t enough 
infj,hi fellow <type>s   i just thought i d post here because i ve been feeling like maybe noone would understand me quite like <type>s i was working a remote job recently that paid really well but it felt like i was losing my soul for some reason i started feeling depressed like every day was the same and at one point recently i even told my mother i m not sure why i m living anymore well a few weeks later i got laid off with no warning along with many other people at my company and have been feeling down on myself ever since wondering why i was chosen to be part of the layoff when everyone said my performance was amazing the job market right now has also been a bit tough lots of rejections and jobs that offer alot less than i was previously making i ve been feeling like i just want to sleep      and escape this world that feels too crazy unstable for me i don t even remember what i enjoy doing for fun and i have no motivation so i was just wondering can anyone relate to these depressed feelings and give any advice on how to become alive and hopeful again    i d appreciate any advice so much
istj,hello <type>s   in this interview   i got a chance to talk to jessica about what it  s like to be an <type> si fi sb c    p    fm the first thing i noticed is jessica  s feminine si and despite it being her lead function   she has a bad memory we also discussed her double feminine sf sleep and how she tends to have an identity crisis and does n t feel confident about things she processed she said she also tends to forget the story of the shows she watches and needs to see them again and again jessica said that her nt play last comes out at night and sometimes makes it harder to sleep so   she started doing martial arts to deal with the extra energy at the end of the day jessica is very info dominant and even if she does n t want to gather new information   she will for the sake of accuracy she said there are times she would not text back a friend until she has googled the info well enough that she can provide them with an accurate reply jessica also talked about her big road trip in western united states and how it fed her nf consume and gave her a sense of excitement and gratitude after returning back home watch this interview here 
isfj,list some of your favorite movies and explain why   amelie cinematography i love the quirky yet simple plot   and the quick pace through the movie this movie is the epitome of eye sensory satisfaction   the color purple always one of my favorites   even as a young girl it  s the heart wrenching tear jerker that really shakes my emotions to the core   the jerk i tend to love simple   stupid humor    like dumb and dumber    because there is nothing to absorb at a sensory level 
istp,hello <type>s   in this interview   i got a chance to talk to heather on what it  s like to be an <type> ti se cs b    p    fm this interview was super interesting because you rarely get a chance to talk to an officially typed <type> female they almost do n t exist   and to make this another rare interview opportunity   heather is also the super rare fm <type>   one thing i noticed was that because of gender roles   an <type> female like heather has better use of her fe than male <type>s heather also has double masculine nf blast    ni fe    making her nf quite strong she is still doing the typical <type> st report    ti se      but because it  s double feminine   it  s not as in your face as her ni fe because of her play last    se fe      she tends to lose energy rather quickly and she also disrespects sf play as a result she  s aware of how important sf is but she hates it so it  s work in progress for her to improve on it she  s also looking to doing more hiit based cardio exercise to increase her energy levels which is what she has the most issues with because she  s still an ixxp   she has people problems and has dealt with tribe hate   especially in her younger days overall   it was an insightful interview and there are definitely some differences when you see the male and female variations of the same personality type watch the interview here 
isfp,soo a couple years ago when my <type> friend sent me to take a personality type quiz after i was complaining to her about my job   i found out i was an <type> later on   i decided to take the test again   and i got <type> then did it again and got <type> this test gave a percentage of each and i think i was n t too much more se   but was just by a little this did make me question myself and who i fit under   but for sure i am a more creative   artsy person so i could say i am definitely <type> then the question of intuition has been coming into my mind   especially lately id say over the past couple years i  ve become more intuitive   thinking of the future   trying to plan and set goals i also did n t understand how i could be se dominant if i actually do think i tend to be intuitive then i came across this article a few weeks ago   which says that our   function is extroverted sensing   and   is introverted intuition it then says that we are quite balanced in our se and ni   even through ni is   this was like an aha   moment for me i more started to question it because i recently also came across the idea of highly sensitive people   and i thought that i was one i bought a book called the highly sensitive person and started to read it i just started   but in the first chapter it talks about how hsp are very intuitive people so i thought to myself   if i am considered se   then how can fit as an intuitive hsp well now i think its a little more clear to me i looked quickly into the number of <type>  s that are considered hsp   and it seems to be a low compared to other intuitive personality types id like to get some insight from my other <type>  s do any of you consider yourself to be highly sensitive    also   do you consider yourself to have a good dose of ni   where it can be balanced with your se    im new to diving more into personality types and hsp   so any insight would be great i also just started reading the book so i have no idea what else is in here i guess i just thought that all <type>s would be like me   highly sensitive lol this is interesting to me i am not the number one fan of labels in general   but these have helped me to understand myself better and why things have affected my life 
isfj,i have some <type>s in my life who i love but some of the things they do and say drive me insane   often to the point where even though i love them i strongly dislike the way they behave for example   my mother is an <type> i know she loves me   but she  s suffocating me she has me wrapped up in cotton wool   and whenever i try and tell her i m capable of looking after myself   she gets very upset and tells me  she  s just showing that she cares  i appreciate that she cares   and i tell her this   but i would like her to appreciate that i ca n t be happy without my independence i may live at home   but i am a grown women          it gets worse when she  s stressed she  ll suddenly take on a whole new personality when i was a little girl    about seven    i used to describe her to my friends as  good mom  and  bad mom  good mom was loved to laugh   and kindly corrected me if i did something wrong i was a very good girl   and anything i did wrong was completely unintentional bad mom was completely irrational if i accidentally did something wrong   something good mom would normally laugh about   bad mom would scream at me or hit me of course   she does n t hit me anymore   but the screaming has gotten worse only recently have i been standing up for myself   telling her that there  s no rational reason for her to be acting this way   that it  s unfair for her to take her stress out on me when i  ve done nothing wrong if i make a logical   valid argument      and do n t get me wrong   i m always polite about it      she either slams the door in my face and walks out   or uses the  i m so tortured card     i m so stressed   and you  re not   but you are adding to my stress in some indirect way   therefore i have every right to scream at you    and the worst part    she goes on for hours   sometimes even days   and the entire  argument  can usually be summed up into a single paragraph she just rewords and repeats until she  s left breathless and when she  s out of breath    she sulks   and snaps   and ignores me i feel like it makes her feel a little bit better if she can make everyone feel as miserable as she feels it does n t make any sense because i am very   very careful never to do anything wrong i always try to be polite   honest   modest   gentle   helpful   kind everything a daughter should be her argument for her actions are usually something along the lines of  i m stressed because you have n t cleaned the bathroom this week  she has never asked me to clean the bathroom in my life how should i know    so then i  ll offer a compromise of course   i  ll go and it now   how about i start doing it once a week from now on    but that  s never what she wants to hear she  ll reply with something like  it  s too late now   i  ve already done it i wanted it done yesterday then why did n t she tell me yesterday    because i should have thought to be helpful on my own accord   of course   and so the argument goes round in circles basically   how do i deal with the irrational   emotional side of this <type> without moving out    because i know moving out right now would break her heart   but i have to do something i do not get depressed or upset easily   but my mother leaves me awake crying at night and that  s something not many <type>s can admit to she is the only person to make me cry in the past    years    besides a breakup with a boyfriend   years ago      and somehow she constantly manages to depress me i need to find a way to deal with her   or i  ll have to leave can anyone help    
istj, i m putting this in the <type>   <type>   and <type> forums to see what types of advice i can get i appreciate anything you have to say       ok   help me please   i am an <type> and my dad is ixtj    unsure between s or n still   he says he tests either way    i am about ready to have a breakdown over the relationship between my father and i it seems like we can rarely spend more than an hour or two alone before we are bickering about something   and sometimes he just throws these awful tantrums if i do n t do something his way now   everybody knows the biggest issue between our two types is      housework and      control my dad loves control he  s been divorced twice    my parents divorced when i was       he has me terrified to actually move out because he says if i do n t follow his schedule i will end up homeless and working at burger king the rest of my life i am almost a senior in college    live at home   attend school online    and i do n t feel like i m ready to face the world at all all i hear about is how i do things wrong luckily i  ve been in therapy for the last two years so i m working on these issues alone   but his constant yelling just still brings me down he is even controlling my therapy   luckily i m about done with my program   but he said after this year no more if i get sick and go to the doctor   all he talks about is how much money i m costing him he pays for all my expenses   which i am truly grateful for    really i am        but i just feel like there  s an emotionally draining price to pay the housework issue is just god awful i  ve gotten better about keeping most of the house clean   but with my bedroom bathroom i really do n t care it is nothing against him whatsoever   but for me to clean is just not my nature i do n t think about putting something away after i  ve used it i toss my clothes on the floor my junk litters the bathroom counter keep in mind   we do not share a bathroom so   unpredictable him says nothing half the time   and the other half he has these temper tantrums he screams at me and orders to listen to his barking he says if i do n t clean or do xyz   he  ll throw away my stuff if i go into my room and lock my door   he screams loud and threatens me he thinks everything i do    or do n t do    is to piss him off he thinks i do n t clean my room to purposely piss him off i just do n t think about it   i also feels like he values his  stuff  more than me if i break something or something gets messed up in the house and i ca n t provide a logical explanation of how it exactly happened   i get yelled at for example   the sprayer on the sink got stuck one morning while i was making coffee while trying to unstick it   it popped off no big deal i immediately called him and let him know so he would n t come home to a broken sink he says it  s fine that night   he gets on my case about how it  really  broke he said he was sick of my friends messing around with his shit and breaking everything um   i was the one who caused it to pop off i am not aware of doing anything unusual to the sprayer or this one is even better    more hilarious   sad   whatever you choose    so my boyfriend comes over one morning and we were planning on cooking a huge breakfast so he helps me make the omelets and we have a good time we did n t break my dad  s stuff   we cleaned it   put it away when we were done that night dad starts yelling at me about how my boyfriend  scratched  his pan    it was a tiny little scratch    well   it happens   plus it  s an item you cook with you expect it not to get scratched    is it me   or does it seem unrealistic    then he yells about how we did n t clean the kitchen enough nothing is ever good enough for him   and his stuff means more to him than me i suppose another issue is finances i  ve been struggling ever since a manic episode caused by a medication last summer   when i blew my savings account now he lent me the money to pay for the debt   and i paid him back in full but i was still having trouble saving my money i finally just saved enough money to pay off all my own department store credit cards    it was quite a bit    and i just tossed them in the trash    last week   actually      so now my savings is scant he asks today   i tell him   and he freaks out he  s saying i ca n t control my money and now wants to control my account i am      i do n t want him touching my own money because i m going to be out of the house soon enough he says if i do n t show him my account   i have to move out by the end of december that  s another thing    lol   long rant   ca n t you tell we just had a fight       he  s always threatening to kick me out if i do n t pick the clothes off my floor   move out   if i do n t put the dishes away immediately   get the out   he  s said that a million times in the last few years   and obviously i m still home go figure his control is just maddening i can totally understand why mom divorced him his girlfriend is pleasant but similar in behavior    to her own son   actually    i want nothing to do with them for the most part he spends most of the time    including nights    at his girlfriend  s so i really do n t have to deal with this anymore but on the inside   i still feel like i m    i know i am plenty capable of getting my ass out of the house   yet it seems like he has this mental leash on me what can i do to make him less jerk like without completely complying to his every demand    i have made a lot of changes in the last year a year ago   i was drinking heavily   having sex too willingly   partying basically   extremely reckless i  ve cleaned up entirely now i have not had a drop of alcohol in over six months   i am getting mostly a  s in my bachelor  s program        gpa      i attend church on a regular basis and am active in the congregation   i m working on becoming a leader in a christian recovery program   i write a blog   i have a great part time job   i take voice lessons in return for babysitting   i have not had sex in a long time   etc i do not think i am still acting like a child my frustration might seem childish    it probably is      but i have made a lot of progress without my dad  s help his behavior is still the same is it hopeless to think our relationship with ever be ok    i love him to death and he shows his love by showering me with extreme generosity but i just feel like things are destroyed and i ca n t salvage a good relationship with him what can i do that  s reasonable    for both him and me    that helps our bond grow    btw   i live with him at home   and it  s just the two of us 
entp,hello there <type>s     <type> here   ouo just dropping by to say hi   i hear you guys are awesome   enthusiastic and hmm very intellectual people i wonder if anyone out here would like to be friends with me hehe looks around tongue anyway   nice to meet you      
intp,after searching a lot for my type i finally can rest comfortably   knowing i m an <type> i had various doubts and was very skeptical but i managed to slowly understand why i m <type> and why some parts of the description did n t match after this   i have one last challenge for myself being able to describe my own personality let  s do it first of all   let  s clarify something first mbti ca n t describe a person  s behavior   tastes   dreams or interests entirely with perfect accuracy two persons of the same type can be completely different but there are always some common behaviors that some types of people can share   which can be described and analyzed by their cognitive processes it does not mean that a person of type x will act the same way in every situation y this means there can be some exceptions for everything that i may write here <type>s are defined by their   principal functions ti   ne   si   and fe let  s see a summary of each one ti stands for introverted thinking   but i prefer to call it subjective reasoning i like to call it that way because basically it is exactly what ti does ti is a judging function which means it will judge every information that <type>s may collect as their first function   it means that it works in hardcore style   so an <type> will only really absorb data that is accepted by ti ti is logical but it does not mean you are a supercomputer like some descriptions may make you feel like it just means that you like to pick information   deconstruct it   analyze each part of it and    if needed    deduce the bigger picture of it or a solution to a problem ti also likes categorizing things and all this comes so naturally for <type>s that they do n t even realize they are doing it also because it  s subjective   people wo n t see you doing it ne is extraverted intuition i did n t have a special name for it   but with some help   i do now objective possibilities ne is the primary way the world sees you   this is usually what is being shown to people    because it  s extraverted    ne is the primary way that you gather information ne is like that kid with hyperactivity who just ca n t sit and stay quiet for   minutes but just inside their mind because people may sometimes question if <type>s are really alive it just wants to explore the world and everything but unlike se   it wants to explore ideas and concepts in an abstract way   rather than using the   senses in the <type>  s case   it means that ne serves ti feeding it with new information to judge for the <type> it  s normal to be able to connect various ideas easily and think outside the box   being able to see outside the box and predict outcomes to his and other  s actions and learning by others  experiences si means introverted sensing think in a hard drive   that is how si works most for <type> an hd every data collected by ne and judged by ti will be stored with si because ne is focused on ideas it may be kinda negligent with the physical world si help to remember the mistakes from the past so <type>s can act right when they encounter the same problem in the next opportunity not only that   it helps you to interpret the data you experienced with your body and store it but it wo n t be super detailed because it  s underdeveloped also   <type>s are prone to neglecting physical necessities like eating or sleeping fe is the last one   extraverted feeling which i would call objective ethics fe is focused on aiding people   is the part of <type>s that prevent them to be robots but because it  s the last one   it  s even more underdeveloped   which means they want to help people but do n t have any idea on how to give emotional support if you talk with some <type> about your problem   they will probably give a logical solution to it okay   let  s now talk about how this works in real life socializing <type>s tend to live in their own heads it  s common for them to be completely oblivious to their surrounds my point here is that they are so used in being absorbed in their thoughts that socializing is n t always a priority but this does not mean that <type>s do n t like people or hanging out sometimes when they are socializing   people   as i said   will usually perceive their auxiliary ne this means they will be that quiet person observing everyone talk   with calm curiosity will make some well timed jokes and then get back observing then they will be completely distracted by some random thought triggered by a topic that will lead to another and another and another topic inside their head after several minutes they will try to catch up on the actual topic or discuss what they were thinking   only to get his friends confused about how he could get so far away from the first conversation but behind that is his ti   holding him back and analyzing everything   every time that  s why ne wo n t be so intense as it would be in a ne dom   they will be much more concerned in being accurate in everything they do or talk than being creative and active while that happens si will help the <type> to remember what not to do or talk   based on past experiences   will also help them remember about that interesting article they read in wikipedia that no one cares about and fe will be helping them care or try to care for others   some <type>s may be that kind of person that laughs about a joke that someone made and no one in the group was hearing because they were so focused on talking at the same time an <type> with minimal fe can be that type of person who wants to be kind and nice to everyone   not knowing how to show boundaries to others or being rude when trying to <type>  s biggest weakness is its lack of emotional intelligence just like anyone <type>s experience deep and intense emotions but do n t know how o deal with it they usually ignore   suppress or try to analyze it with ti this leads to being bad at coping with stressful situations   so bad that they do n t even realize sometimes that they are stressed until it  s too late when <type>s reach their limits they can become overly emotional and express an exaggerated response to conflict or isolate themselves into their mind   which can lead to being over analytical and repetitive   thinking about the same problems in an endless loop decision making their approach to making a decision is basically problem solving but ti is a very exigent function and wo n t just accept any solution it needs to be above all accurate   not just efficient or ethical so <type>s can take a lot of time to actually make a decision   depending on the complexity of the problem their main approach is to gather some time alone to think they will try to use ti and si to solve   considering fe when needed    but not much    if this is not sufficient they may ask for help   but not to solve the problem   they wo n t easily accept other  s solutions because <type>s only accept their own reasoning    unless the solution makes sense for them    they will usually ask somebody for more information or try to explain their thought process to get an opinion   which is ne in action people may think that they want external validation   sometimes it  s true   but usually   they are just testing their ideas and thoughts probably anything that the person try to say   the <type> will already know but it  s useful for the <type> to do that so they can test the possibilities before deciding something their decision process is so careful that after taking a decision   they become very stubborn and wo n t accept counter arguments easily because they probably tested all those counters before alone but if needed to make a fast decision in a problem they never dealt with   they wo n t know how to act properly   which can appear as they are some kind of dumb weirdos and making <type>s stressed and sometimes disappointed with themselves probably a well developed ne can help <type>s to deal with this kind of situation romance <type>s can be kinda hard to deal with in a relationship   depending on which type the partner is because they will usually require time alone to think and focus on doing their stuff also   <type>s can be disorganized as hell they are usually oblivious to how messy they are and even when they notice   <type>s do n t really care but because they care for their partner and try to always understand others   they may usually work on this they value creative and intellectual partners and will probably be exigent in that aspect they are also very laid back and value freedom from both sides career i  ve only seen two types of <type>s until now the ones who take a career very seriously and the ones who do n t give a f ck <type>s will often prefer careers that avoid the need to make a physical effort the stereotype says that they tend to prefer science and technology   but they can be anything that catches their interest    just like any type    the problem is that they get bored easily when they feel there is a lack of challenge in their field there is also <type>s who prefer to work on jobs that do n t need much effort and time investment   so they can focus on their personal pursuits in their free time that  s it guys   hope you liked i tried to make a more human   realistic type of description   instead of the super genius with no emotions stereotype i took into consideration my own experiences and others i  ve seen on the internet i m an <type>  w    so i m not sure if it will work with other enneagrams

esfp,just need some perspective my coworker at my new job is an <type>      f    and she happened to train me      f    on my first day we actually had a lot in common and she was so helpful and i could tell she genuinely wanted to make me comfortable me being overly sensitive shy   i anticipated my first day being stressful and she always assures me to not overthink things she s been there for every mistake i made   and tries to make me feel better after each time i thought she was cute   the second i saw her but didn t think she liked girls so i wasn t pursuing the same day   i heard her checking out and complimenting someone s girlfriend   freely still i fell back because i was the new girl and didn t wanna seem distracted or overbearing she was surprised i was    and told me that i carried myself well so i wanted to keep that calm demeanor i knew i had a crush but wanted to tone it down because i felt a pressure at work and would make many mistakes and just feel anxious and overthink the entire time she knows i m shy and sometimes i felt hurt whenever she doesn t initiate convos and talks to others i don t initiate and i feel jealous when others spend a long time with her because she is so social also sometimes she purposely ignores me      i ve seen her do this to others    i think she does this when stressed or feels controlled i want to see this <type> as a friend bc she is the closest co worker i have   and the most understanding of my personality my feelings get hurt often and don t want it to hurt my friendship bc i need friends at work lol and she s great i do think she s attracted to me because ever since training she became touchy feely    she regularly would play with my hair   place her hand on my back or try to touch hands or arms    this basically happens every shift we are together   i am very aware of body language and notice she always tries to get closer to me i don t initiate physical touch but she always comes to the host stand leans over on her phone   and will stay there touching my arm    she ll stop if i don t reciprocate    l also i catch her staring at me sometimes bc i am always in a daze looking at nothing but can feel when someone is looking at me she s called me every pet name i think she s most positive towards me she also shows me she cares she reiterates my bday or facts about me    if relevant to convo    she splits easy tasks with me so i won t be bored and can hang out w her she over communicates   directly and honestly asking me why i don t talk   initiate convos or socialize with others she says we re different and that s ok times i have been off putting to her    trying to protect my feelings    she still tries to talk and then i feel bad i ve grown attached bc she s made an strong effort to get to know and befriend me now i can t get over the flirtatiousness for a fact   she knows i like her i ve acted too clumsy too nervous far too many times anyone with a brain could tell but she played on it or teased me   instead or being annoyed or awkward it was always entertaining to her i love that she cares about me but i hate that she is not     aware of my feelings while flirting with me it s like she s there one second and then she s gone i think she enjoys the attention while enjoying the friendship because it s not like i m starting the flirtation shes verbatim told me i am trying to get a reaction out of you    referring to playing w my hair    thought on my conclusion    like i said   i really think she s a good person but cannot stand the thought of my feelings as her entertainment whether she likes me or not i don t fully blame her   she probably thinks i don t take the feelings i try to hide seriously and that i enjoy the flirting as much as her honestly it s a painfully redundant cycle
intj,i feel stupid   ugly   or at the very least mediocre there are times when i skip class simply because i m not feeling attractive i m in deep pain i ca n t bear to accept the idea that i m not someone remarkable or exceptional the idea that i may never be relevant in the grand scheme of things it  s been putting me off doing a lot of things   from working on my songs to attending college classes my self esteem is devastated   nothing seems good enough for me i also no longer see the point in participating in college classes to have a mediocre job with a mediocre life i really want to grow in the musical and artistic field be someone inspiring and eccentric and disclose all my artistic potential of course   i m not going to stop doing these things completely   as i still believe in the possibility that i can create something beautiful and inspiring i will continue with all my remaining strength to aim at intellectual and artistic development but the fact that i am already    years old and still have n t done anything that relevant leaves me in a state of deep melancholy   since when i do   it will only be considered a   good job for my age     not   a work of a young prodigy with great potential   how can i get around this inconceivable desire to want to be something so phenomenal that is making me give up on life    does anyone have a point of view that might comfort me    am i just in some kind of addiction or mindless pursuit of admiration    or in terms of typology am i repressing my se or something    a ni fi loop perhaps    
istj,i  ve read thru many of your threads   including the stickies   and have learned a lot but one thing i ca n t understand is   if an <type> man is clearly into you   why is he so passive as far as pursuit goes    my <type> lives     hours away and owns a few successful businesses   therefore   he is very busy however   when i ask to see him   he will drive out to my place or vice versa   no problem he consistently initiates texts with me on a daily basis   has told me he sees a future with me   i check all his boxes   and he wants to build a home family with me but he never asks to see me or plans a date it  s like there  s no urgency on his part it drives me crazy and absolutely baffles me as an <type>   i usually end up with aggressive and passionate men who go from      right away and pursue me with gusto so this whole slower than a snail with a broken leg thing is really hard for me to understand conversation with him is easy   but i am leery as to how to approach this with him i know i need to be direct   but i also have read that patience is the key so my question is do <type> men prefer to be pursued by the women they  re interested in    and if so   what  s the best way to do this without overwhelming or pressuring him    if he  s not actively asking me out   should i assume he  s not interested    very confusing if you could shed some light i would greatly appreciated fwiw   we  re in our   s and have been dating   months with a break in between due to communication issues   which we are resolving very well now we are exclusive but not committed    he says relationships take time to develop commitment is a huge step    
infj,i figured somebody might possibly like a thread where they will be able to post the random things on their mind   whether it  s an idea   a simple thought   complex thoughts   problems anything they wish to share without criticism or judgement let  s face it   writing down our thoughts   feelings   wisdom   etc   is n t the best thing to do because   although often personal   it disallows the communication with other humans we so desire    plus this saves the trees that we should be using to cut down on carbon dioxide   yet we instead cut them down    i  ll go first why the hell is coming up with a random thought so difficult when you feel as though you  re in the spotlight   yet you do it all the time when you do n t feel pressured    also   hard nipples 
esfp,hi <type>s   so i have this close guy friend who is an <type> tbh   i put him on decent attractiveness level   he has a steady career in it    not crazy money but not broke either      he  s friendly   personable   basically i m just getting all the superficial stuff out of the way to make him not seem like a repulsive bum in any way that a girl would n t consider him he has this one ex   let  s call her c    which we will get to later    who he dated maybe   years ago and ca n t stop romanticizing her however   in the course of that breakup up until now he has tried to date maybe   girls who he became absolutely infatuated with very early into getting to know them and they all refused to commit to him because he seemed too much for them he would become extremely clingy   needy   and put these girls on a pedestal before they could even determine their true feelings towards him basically   doing boyfriend things without actually being their boyfriend i told him to stop doing this until the girl earns your love   but he just ca n t seem to help himself once he feels an attraction towards her i do n t want to be sexist here   but i can see this behavior being more tolerable i guess as a female trait but it kind of is frowned upon coming from a guy he would then be left absolutely demoralized and feel used for all the love and attention he gave them only to not receive it back i personally see this as illogical since on the girl  s end   she did n t even say she was ready for all this attention when they were merely just trying to get to know him during this time fast forward to present time   he  s now pretty cynical when it comes to love he refuses to get close to women he wo n t even go with the flow and sleep around have fun because he  s afraid of repeating his mistakes he just pictures himself choosing the wrong girl   getting hurt again   and does n t even bother pursuing anybody it  s been like this for almost a year now going back go his ex   c he will occasionally think about her or have dreams about her and have it ruin his mood all day because of it it seems like he views her as the girl who got away and ca n t seem to move past it even though that can no longer be rekindled it seems like he keeps comparing himself to what he used to have and who he used to be with her and compare it to how he does n t have that right now and then beats himself over it for all the <type> guys on here or even girls who have had this issue   is this relatable to you    also   how have you dealt with trying to tone down your emotions and know when to give to someone your time love vs knowing when it  s the wrong time <type>s are super sweet do n t get me wrong they make absolutely amazing supportive friends who are always down to have a good time   however i can see how their se fi   when not curbed correctly   can be put into absolute override and become overwhelming to the person on the receiving end please i really want to offer some advice to him to get over this hump but as an <type>   i feel like the solutions and advice i give him might just be a little too logical for him to relate to if you guys can give me some sort of insight that will resonate with him or a comparable story and how you personally got through it   it would be incredibly helpful thanks   
infj,they say a picture is worth a thousand words and words are quite valuable   if you pick the right ones so   anyway   sometimes i glance through pictures of nature   picture of animals   pictures i drew   and pick out one that most reflects my current mood it  s a fun little activity that lets you show    not just tell    someone how you are feeling plus   it lets you get a little creative while looking at pretty pictures of things i figured since we have a thread about posting music that describes your mood   it might be fun feel free to explain as much or as little as you want about your picture selection and of course   like a good <type>   if someone is having a bad day   feel free to cheer them up with happy pictures   or words i do n t own any of the pictures i post   unless otherwise stated alright   enough rambling this is a picture that best describes my current mood i think this one is fitting seemingly peaceful and beautiful on the surface   but deep in the cavern thing under the rock   it  s a bit dark i feel like there  s a lot of stress hanging over me    like the giant rock      and i m not quite sure why i mean   life looks good right now    except for a few minor hiccups      but instead of enjoying the scenery   i feel trapped under a rock b does that make sense    edit why is it so tiny    here is a link to a bigger size http   bp blogspot com  gne crpp kkwtcpm s    rock outcropping            jpg
infj,if we get enough votes   i was hoping to get this thread stickied so <type>s can use it as a medium to vent and have quick access to it   instead of making individual threads anyways   if you  re having a bad day or just want to yell to the four winds issues that have been frustrating you lately   this is the thread to do so of course   if you have specific issues that you would like our wise members of this board to help you out with   you  re welcome to make your own thread for it begin 
intp,from all the stereotypes   this is what bugs me the most that <type>s hate celebrating their birthdays and they never tell when their birthday is i am not talking on behalf of all <type> right now   but on behalf of myself now i am already    y o and birthday celebration i ca n t remember when was the last one and no   it  s not because i do n t want to   but rather because no one even remembers about birthday anymore yes   family included and i get angry when on   th october    my birthday   feel free to wish me a happy birthday on that day    nobody comes   nobody even calls when i was a kid   my birthday parties were thrown every year and they were fun   now   there are only memories sad that  s my story anyway do you have any stories of your own    feel free to share 
istj,  hate history   do n t understand the laws   do n t like to study and prepare long before   do n t overly plan everything by the hour             it  s really interesting how many such atypical representatives are here
isfj,there seemed to be some pushback when i posted a similar list by susan storm on the <type> forum no one should take this list verbatim if anything   there may be another list posted in another forum where you can compare and contrast the differences and similarities based on ms storm  s assessment   you crave a sense of continuity knowing what to expect in life is crucial to you as an <type> having a plan   routine   and structure for your day gives you a sense of peace and frees up your mind to focus on more exciting things you naturally create routines   pleasant rituals   and habits that make your life feel dependable and positive   you have an extraordinary sense of responsibility it s vital to you to follow through on what you ve said you will do your word isn t given lightly   and when you make a commitment it s held close to your heart you believe in loyalty   reliability   and selflessness and try to emulate this in your life   you experience the present through filters of your past almost instantaneously   you make comparisons between what s happening now and what happened in the past you tend to see patterns because of this   and readily notice when an action doesn t fit the pattern you ll quickly notice when someone s body language changes   when their tone of voice changes   or even when a room has been re decorated in a minor way this is because you are constantly making comparisons and noticing when there s an aberration in the overall pattern   you enjoy creating traditions and pleasing rituals whether you re re creating your grandmother s best chocolate chip cookie recipe or celebrating the winter s solstice by lighting a candle and listening to your favorite songs   traditions are close to your heart you naturally create pleasant rituals and enjoy revisiting them year after year to commemorate special moments in your life   you replay the past in vivid detail you have a vivid and rich internal memory and you enjoy recalling beautiful memories regularly re experiencing your favorite memories can get you into a state of flow and can remind you of the events that have made life worth living at the same time   you can also replay negative past experiences in vivid detail you might lie awake in bed at night replaying about something embarrassing you did in junior high or a relationship blunder you regret it s crucial for you to learn to forgive yourself for past mistakes so that you don t get wrapped up in a cycle of punishing yourself for them   you have nuanced inner body sensations you tend to notice inner body signals very quickly this can mean noticing symptoms of sickness earlier than other types or tasting nuances in flavors that others miss because you re so sensitive to inner body sensations   you prioritize getting enough sleep   eating at consistent times   and taking care of yourself physically   you thrive when you can do detail oriented projects alone whether you re knitting a sweater   carving   cooking   or weeding your garden   you enjoy being alone to really immerse yourself in the details of something when you can tune out all the noise of the outer world and really delve into a project in depth you experience a calming sense of satisfaction   you have favorite tv shows you ll never tire of re watching maybe you have a doctor who marathon every summer or a gilmore girls party every fall whatever it is   there s probably a book or television series that you watch annually because it puts you in a particular mood and helps you commemorate a tradition that brings you joy or makes you laugh   you have a strong sense of what you should or should not do you are guided by your values and regularly assess your actions to see if they re lining up with what your conscience is telling you a sense of should or should not guides you and influences the actions you take you put a lot of thought into your decisions to see if the consequences will be things you can be proud of    you love good vibes creating a relaxed   optimistic atmosphere is something that brings you a lot of joy you enjoy swapping jokes and interesting stories with your friends   making your house smell nice with candles or baked goods   or playing low key competitive games creating   or being in   an atmosphere that is laid back   harmonious   and pleasant is food for your soul    you innately know what people want you quickly pick up on the non verbalized needs and emotions of other people if you have friends over   you immediately notice if someone seems cold and might need a blanket or someone is looking around and probably wants to know where the bathroom is you also notice when one person seems to like another person or when somebody wants to give criticism but is trying to figure out the most tactful way to give it    it can be difficult for you to take care of yourself because you re so focused on others this is especially true of <type> parents and spouses because <type>s are so in tune with the emotional and physical needs of others they can feel compelled to fix things for everyone else instead of meeting their own needs they often feel guilty for taking time for themselves   especially if they know others are struggling or could use some help eventually   this tends to lead to burnout or co dependency   so it s crucial for <type>s to learn to set healthy boundaries and practice saying no    you are very protective of family you ll go the extra mile to protect your loved ones from harm especially those in your family or inner circle of friends you have a gift for creating stability   security   and dependability for the people you care about it s like you create a force field of protection and gentle care around the people you love    you thrive when you can create something high quality you d rather do something well than do it fast while you are extremely conscious of deadlines   it s more important for you to produce high quality results than to get something done ahead of schedule you get a sense of pleasure from perfecting every detail of a project or task and many people consider you to be meticulous    when you re stressed   you see negative possibilities everywhere during cases of extreme or chronic stress   you get lost in catastrophic thinking you imagine dozens of worst case scenarios and every negative possibility makes you think of another connected tragedy find out ways to manage stress here how each myers briggs personality type reacts to stress   and how to help    you dislike telling people what to do you d rather give people information than be overly directive with them for example   instead of saying   bob   would you set up a hotel reservation for august   th    you might say   bob   do you know a good hotel for our trip on august   th       you also dislike being told what to do while you might seem quiet and agreeable on the outside   inside you re a bit of a rebel you can handle some structure and rules   but you don t like dealing with authoritative   rank pulling individuals you appreciate people who give everyone a chance to have a voice in a decision you believe that the best decision comes from collaboration    you don t ask things of others you wouldn t do yourself you hate intruding on others time and space   so delegating can be hard for you you re unlikely to ask someone to do something you wouldn t do   and many times you try to just do things yourself rather than asking for help    you get quiet when you get upset you are famously patient and understanding   but there are limits when you ve been angered by someone repeatedly   you re likely to get quiet and retreat into mental analysis this is when you delve into your sensing and thinking functions you try to find the rational reasons for your anger and explore whether there are any logical inconsistencies you re not seeing you also try to look at the history of the situation to see if there are any negative patterns that are repeating themselves just be careful if you keep stifling your anger it s likely to come out in a surprisingly explosive way while it may be difficult to verbalize your anger   it s an important part of a healthy relationship    you have a good sense of humor you enjoy lighthearted banter   friendly teasing   and situational humor you also enjoy sharing memes or funny gifs online you tend to find something offbeat and funny in nearly any situation   but you don t always verbalize it you might just get a sparkle in your eye and a half smile on your face as a funny scenario or impression plays in your mind s eye you can even be gifted in turning a conflict situation into something funny and helping people to laugh about it    you crave tangible sensory experiences you enjoy taking your favorite objects in your hands and touching them   noticing every detail on your fingertips you savor the texture of warm   fuzzy socks and cherish the first sip of a hot cup of tea when you feel something   you try to notice every detail about it and experience it in all its intensity    you re wary of intrusive people while you re typically friendly   generous   and easy going   people who seem especially needy or physically overbearing make you put your guard up you like steady   loyal relationships where you have the freedom to disappear for a busy week or two    or month even    and re connect as if no time has ever gone by people who blow up your phone with texts or are always invading your personal space often make you feel uncomfortable and hesitant    you take great joy in simple pleasures you believe that life is made up of thousands of precious moments that other people fail to appreciate in their hurry from the glisten of dewdrops on a blade of grass to the taste of an icy cold popsicle on a hot summer day   you try to savor all the little details and moments that make life worth living    you struggle to see your own potential you tend to struggle when it comes to forecasting your abilities and potential you live from moment to moment and try to enjoy all that life has to offer   but you don t always know how to anticipate what s coming down the road years from now you may have incredible gifts and abilities that could be used in powerful ways   but it often takes a friend to help you realize the potential of your many strengths 
infj,this will be a simple and easy way to get things off your chest without losing your cool or sounding like a whiny little piece cheese the purpose of this thread is for you to write letters to people or things that will never get to read them sounds stupid    probably dry but at least you can say what needs to be said without being judged for the contents of your letter and have some anonymous person out there in the world actually give a damn wink also   i did n t want to limit this thread to only <type>s but i have a feeling we  ll need it the most crazy so be serious    or not    just have fun with it   darlings   i  ll start dear smoothie girl   i think you might have slipped a bit of alcohol into my strawberry banana smoothie and although i cannot stand the taste or smell of liquor   i thank ye kindly for it and will smile extra nicely at you the next time we meet sincerely   an <type>
isfp,i m curious as to whether anyone here has an <type> child   or for any <type>s reading this   have you an <type> parent    mother   especially    would you be kind enough to share your experiences    my mother is an <type> and i find that we are extremely different we do n t really get each other   and it really frustrates me at times everything that we think   enjoy   say   etc are profoundly different and i find that i have a difficult time enjoying her company unless we  re basing every conversation and action together on something plain   simple and everyday which is eventually too boring and one sided for me i do n t have the standard relationship with my mother that most people may have i was n t raised by her    no   my parents are n t divorced or living separately    and we have an odd acquaintance relationship which both of us feel the need to improve it  s while i m trying to build a relationship with her that all these differences and annoyances come out i realise that the cognitive functions for <type>s and <type>s are very different would that be a strong contributing factor to this    does anyone else have any similar experiences    it  s funny though   because one of my adored friends is an <type> as well i can see that we have very different values and thought processes though   so while i adore this friend of mine   i m not     comfortable around her but she  s better to be with than my mother   it seems another thing is she ca n t offer emotional support to people   i find   for she  s rather awkward about it 
istp,i was listening to a podcast with joyce meng interviewing a group of <type> types there was a part of the segment that alluded to <type> types neglecting family   friends   etc and not being conscious of it i do that in droves   but i also do it when i leave let  s say a job i may have former co workers attempting to stay in touch   but with anything once i am gone   i leave that aspect of my life behind and do n t give it too much thought i think this may be related to extraverted sensing where the cognitive function is in the present   not in the past or too far in the future thoughts    
istp,if you are an <type> then tell me what it means when it says you have a strong need for space in a relationship give examples are you ever called neglectful    <type> profile
istj,out of these types series   which do you prefer and why    if other   state what that might be 
esfp,dating an <type> for almost two months has been challenging but there  s also psychological understanding and attraction between us so it is n t one sided when we talk about hobbies   arts   and places it can be extremely comfortable and enjoyable however   i m not truly sure if this young man wants to be serious with me we are only in our early twenties and i do n t have that much experience in the dating world except with this young <type> who has at least   lovers before me he told me that he wanted to consider me as his wife unless i fulfilled his criteria which obviously has to be about looks and body i told him that these are superficial things and that in the end   looks will merely fade i understand it can be an important factor especially if he is truly visual and i m sure even without me   he can get another lady if he desires to if he had someone with whom he went out before and he is comparing me with those women   then i just do n t understand the idea of him being with me if he knows i ca n t satisfy his wishes sometimes if i can recall   at least we clashed but manage to forgive each other until there will be another conflict if we are already like this during dating   i do n t know if marriage is the best solution since it wo n t be the same usually   dating is supposed to be easier   i thought well   not in this relationship lol i was anticipating this relationship to last long term and i know i should n t expect anything too much   but after going through hardships i had a chance to move on and not fall for another heartbreak if marriage is uttered in his tongue   i believe he wants to respect me and be frank about the situation so   i m not sure why he always cancels our plan if we want to have a date and talk about serious matters oh   i do n t know we  ll see 
istj,hello <type>s   in this interview   i got a chance to talk to jamie and cherie about their similarities and differences as a standard and jumper <type> type for context   the jumper <type> type simply jumps over the te and becomes si and fi first as oppose to si and te we started the interview with cherie and jamie talking about their observer problems with their phones then   we jumped into the topic of talking about the feeling of disrespected for the standard <type> and getting tribe hate from the jumper <type> cherie and jamie started making fun of me and said that all nt  s like wearing cardigan and it  s a nerd thing    looks like i  ll have to start wearing my cardigan on some interviews    this interview was actually really funny   with the <type>s observer problems   making fun of self and tribe   and their weirdness with consuming new information during our discussion about consuming new information   both jamie and cherie said they get really weird about consuming new information they said all they want is to consume what they  ve already seen but they  re not allowed because that  s cheating and you need to consume something new we also started talking about being a double decider and funny enough we started both praising and making fun of ixxp types    double deciders have to be balanced with praising and making fun of otherwise   it becomes weird    it  s all in good fun of course because we like ixxps as friends cherie and jamie also started talking about their masculine ne and how their predictions tend to be wrong they said they feel confident about it because it  s masculine but because it  s a demon   they do n t feel responsible for making sure their prediction is right finally   we talked about the fi si identity and how it  s not good to tie the identity to your role or job instead   you need to look at your role or job and see if they tick all the boxes in your top   values if it ticks all the boxes then it  s the right job for you and if not then continue the search watch this interview here 
isfj,do you like watching movies   <type>s    yesterday i watched odd thomas and i found it very interesting i think thomas has some characters of <type> like batman in batman series the film is about the good and the bad with mixed events which could guide the audiences to follow the main actors misleading thoughts this film has a lot of emotional and thrilling materials that touch my senses overall   the movie has decent actors actresses and astonishing end    except some violent and scary scenes which you might be afraid of and   predictable culprit    my judgment     
istj,i am placing these list from susan storm s website you should not use this list in an attempt to determine your type instead the list is being placed here for discussion among <type> types or compare list with other types that you may want to compare and contrast   you use your past as a guide for the future as you go through life   you consider it your moral obligation to learn from each experience   whether it s a failure or a success you collect these experiences and recall them when a crisis hits or a solution is needed to a problem that said   if you re in an unhealthy phase of life   you might get hooked on bad habits from your past enjoying the comfort or thrill of these habits and wanting to relive them even if they have negative consequences   you remember the facts and details of past experiences well you have a gift for remembering little details and experiences from the past because of this   you quickly notice changes and shifts for example   if you walk into a room   you might be the first to notice that the furniture has been rearranged you also might notice if someone s body language differs from their typical composure and sense that something isn t right   you crave a sense of routine unpredictable situations are anathema to you   so you try to have a clear direction for your day usually you have a calendar planned out and a daily flow that helps you to know what to expect and when this sense of routine and consistency puts you at ease and gives you the freedom to think clearly   you enjoy reliving your favorite memories all types enjoy reminiscing from time to time   but you seem to have a special affinity for it you can close your eyes and recall a past memory and feel as if you are really living and breathing it the past comes to life in vivid detail and lush imagery you can even enter a state of flow through this process find out more things you enjoy in    things that excite the <type> personality type   following through on your word is a huge priority for you because being consistent and dependable is so crucial to you   people know that they can depend on you to mean what you say and do what you say you ll do letting someone down or forgetting a responsibility makes you feel intense shame and frustration   you experience d j vu a lot because your memory for details and experiences is so remarkable   you quickly make connections between what is happening now and what happened in the past small similar experiences or sights can give you a sudden   unexpected feeling of d j vu people of your type frequently mention having this sensation on a regular basis   you post process experiences to enjoy them fully when you re experiencing something new you tend to feel a little detached from it as if experiencing the full weight of the present moment would be overwhelming however   after the experience is over you often replay it in your mind enjoying the beauty of it more after the fact than during which leads to our next point   you beat yourself up over past mistakes because you re always trying to learn from your mistakes and you have a tendency to post process experiences   you have a tendency to re play embarrassing or awkward moments in your head you might lie in bed at night beating yourself up over mistakes you made    or    years ago   feeling as if the shame and frustration of it all is happening in the present   you try to have a calm   composed manner loud   brash   over reactive people tend to annoy you you respect people who can maintain a sense of composure and control   even in

infp,hello everyone   i m new here i decided to join the forums to hopefully get some opinions on something that  s been going around my mind for some time edited out for privacy reasons too many details so the deal is while i try to come to terms with my own issues   is this behaviour normal for <type>s    what  s your take    i m obviously not asking people to guess what he  s thinking   but i m very much confused 
infj,hi   female <type> here i recently started doing online dating apps it started great at first but i had trouble connecting with men i m not sure if it was my problem or theirs i realized i m reluctant to bridge personal topics   so my conversational starters are often about their work   faith religion   or some intellectual discussions which i enjoy by the way i m also very serious   and not very upbeat and sweet and since most guys there do n t ask questions first   i subconsciously take the lead to keep the convo going but it never lasts long most of them end up not continuing the conversation and leaving on last reply which   if you are like me   is equal to a not interested and i m not really invested to push for it or i stop talking with them because i do n t feel the mutual interest to keep the conversation going since they do n t really try that much have you had similar experiences    
istj,any <type>  s one got a story to tell about a situation that you experienced and either regretted or are proud of that might even changed you for the better or worse i hope this story is n t violating tos of pc because of drug reference the following occurred about   years ago for me i feel proud of a situation and maybe a little regret where i went with some friends         to play disc golf since they asked me we played some then they  d gather in a secluded area and sat around and then they started to light up a bong   shocked i did n t know what to do so i just stayed with them and kindly rejected a puff or what ever you do with it because i did n t want to touch something like that a few even told me something like  class good for you  or  i wish i could be like you  kitteh roud after finishing our game and left i did n t know if i should have called the police or told one of the teachers guidance concealer which i did n t do anything because i did n t know what would have happened to me   our friendship or what not i figured out that day what       was   i usually tell people the same thing about cigarettes alcohol that i do n t smoke or have any and i usually get the same response once in a while that they wish they could be like me or are proud that i do n t 
enfp,saw oppenheimer last night i think it is nolan s masterpiece it was so well told   brilliant in telling   in acting   visualization   the works what a great way to tell this story   that he was already getting judged by others made it so that i didn t have to worry about judging him myself   but could see why the decisions made were made and that the consequences were felt by most of those involved i wanted to see the barbie movie this morning   but my girlfriends and i are gonna try for next week greta gerwig hopefully won t disappoint a fellow <type> i never touched barbie s growing up i hate the smell of plastic i don t think nostalgia is a requirement 
istj,hello <type>s     i was hoping some of you could give me some advice i am an <type> who after having broken up with a controlling and boundary pushing ex two months previous i went on a blind date    my first      with an <type>    who has had very bad luck dating    through a mutual friend at first i found him a bit robotic and very shy   he would n t take the lead on many conversations   regardless i asked him out on a second date at which point i said i feel a spark   but i do n t think it  s all the way there   sorry   but in hindsight i was searching for the wrong traits fast forward a few months and we  ve stayed in contact and the more i get to know him the more we get on really well   i had always valued his sense of duty   reliability   good work ethic and honesty and now he was coming out of his shell i liked him more and more we decided to meet up again last week and had a lovely time out and then went back to mine to watch some films he then started making a move on me   we do n t have sex but done everything in between which i was not expecting   i wanted to tell him how i felt but thought it best to let things sink in and tell him next time i see him which would of been later this week during the weekend though he texts me saying  i  ve been thinking about the other night   i do n t think it should happen again and we should stay friendly sorry i m not in the right frame of mind  i explained to him that that  s okay and i m here if he wants to go into specifics and talk about things   i told him i was going to tell him later on in the week that i did see us more than friends and that at first i could n t make sense of my feelings but i have now and i think we are compatible and that i jumped the gun a bit on our second date he said  that  s okay i just need time to sort myself out before making any decisions  he  s very very stressed from work   sleep deprived and i know things have been vague between us which i know <type>s do n t like but i was wishing to clarify those feelings soon i do n t know how to interpret those messages   should i push for specifics so i can perhaps help him with what  s going on or let him have his space    we are still talking to each other but at a far slower pace i still want to make this work but i feel like i may have missed the chance   i feel like we still need to have a proper conversation about what  s going on   and i want to reconfirm my feelings for him properly but i do n t know when  s best to do that   and as a call   a voice note   a text    he  s too shy to ever bring anything up like this to me   i usually have to make the first move any <type> perspectives would be greatly appreciated on how to navigate the situation   thank you 
intj,hi everyone   been reading for a bit the forum and wanted to ask as the title says for some advice   i hope this is the correct place so   i  ve been with my gf for about   months for a little backstory   we met because mutual friends got to know each other at first the   of us played video games and to get to know each other   and after that i added her to discord we talked more and more each day and get to know each other   about our hobbies   what we studied and all that during our talks on discord the mbti was mentioned and she told me that she was <type> and i talked to her that i had as a result <type> <type>    i m more as a feeler but i m not sure which one i am lol    eventually we get to know more each other and started to really like her   we get on dates and be more comfortable with each other i noticed that she was very touchy   with hugs and kisses   and very open in our conversations and in person we start our relationship and everything was very good and having a good time   but one time she mentioned to me that she was thinking on returning to her city where her parents live to study a masters and even more to ask if she could work remotely due to some problems within her work i have to say she is very focused on that part professionally i showed to her my support and that i would be fine even at a long distance   we planned more of our future as a relationship even with the distance and the hopes to move together later on but as the date that she was going to fly to her city   i noticed that she was a bit more distant   i thought that it was with all the things and changes to come and did n t show any concern i was still supporting her fast forward   i noticed that she was more and more distant we talk mostly by text but mostly phone calls or anything i was mostly initiating and that was starting to get me to feel a bit anxious and insecure i talked about to her the change of it   and she responded to me that she was starting to reconnect more with friends and her family   as well her work was starting to become more busy and appreciated the concern because she understood that she can forgot to respond texts or be a bit of absent on some of her friendships for example i thanked her response and was a bit more relieved but still sometimes i m a bit frustrated that mostly i need to initiate the contact or to think that if i do n t do anything or ask or something we would n t even talk or anything it  s not just the distance but the connection that i m a bit worried one personal thing is that my previous relationship was a bit unstable like discussions and be with the emotions all over the place and with her it has been so   stable    so am i just not accustumed and everything is good    would like to ask for some advice on how to navigate or be more conscious with her   what can i do more or do less    thanks   
estp,i m a    year old college student and an <type> i have started to get feelings towards my male <type> friend and i m not sure what to do about it he is very outgoing   kind and always the life of the party i feel very calm and peaceful when i m around him because he is always looking for fun stuff to do and does n t stress about life like i do and overthink and analyze everything he  s a bit of a man whore    not judging people who like to hook up live your life    but he has mentioned how he might want something more at some point he  s always been super sweet to me and gotten me out of the house when i m in one of my what is life moods and i feel we really have a strange connection and understanding even though we are so different he is athletic and outgoing and involved in so much and i m kind of a cliche <type> who loves to read and write and do artsy stuff    i do like to go out and live it up too but not quite to the same extent         i love to think about people and feelings and can talk for hours about life but he is n t very into that kind of stuff and just prefers to stick to reality and do exciting things in the real world he has flirted with me but i m not sure if he means anything by it   we are good friends and he kind of flirts with everyone i do n t want to ruin a great friendship that has brought so much excitement into my life but i ca n t stop thinking about him and i do n t feel this way very often i m just afraid if we start something he would get bored of me and leave me heartbroken and this friendship would be done for good do you think it  s a disaster waiting to happen if an <type> and <type> date    how do you <type>s feel about <type>s    
intj,there  s a thread like this in the <type> forum   and i thought it would be beneficial here it might help clear up some preconceived notions and stereotypes of <type>  s while also reducing some unnecessary threads so here   any type can ask a question any <type> can answer but remember   we are people too mellow we eat   sleep   and piss like everyone else so ask away   
intj,i was really interested to know to what extant the contrast between the <type>  s and <type>  s inferior se reaches   since they  re both the same in terms of the ni se axis   but they have the small different between fe te and fi ti   so how would you describe your relationship with inferior se    
intj,<type> here met this <type> online and we clicked real fast the chemistry was instantaneous then we started talking on the phone he used to call me every single day and keep me on the phone for hours he used to text me every single day as well i am suppose to meet him in real life later this summer in the beginning he was very direct and clear and said that he wants to actively meet and date me   and i concurred two months into knowing each other   he sent me a heartfelt message saying he  s never had a such a quick depthy connection with someone before in his life and how much he loves our connection   and he told me it  s hard for him to say this to someone however   all of a sudden he became really distant and stopped talking to me so i directly sent him a message and asked him what  s up    are you no longer interested or something    how come i never hear from you anymore    i even asked him on two separate occasions if he  s seeing someone right now and he does n t feel right talking to me   he needs to tell me because i do n t like talking to guys who are already seeing someone else   and he said it  s not the case he said that he  s been working a lot   his living situation is hell   his back is hurting him   etc what is strange is that i see him logged on facebook a lot he shows as active on my messenger app he sure is sooo busy   i m getting honestly worried and anxious   and i m not sure if i should take his word for it why he does n t talk to me anymore we grew very close to each other   it does n t make sense for him to stop talking to me all of a sudden did i get boring to him    why is he so quiet all of a sudden    what could be the reason    he could n t get enough of me for two months straight 
infp,this is the long and awaited thread for non <type>s ask us whatever you want to know or just come and chat with us we  re very friendly

intj,please help     i want to know more about how you guys think   we just reached a   year mark around a month ago we are pretty compatible and happy with each other whenever we are together we were in a long distance relationship and i would drive to see hime twice a month and stay at his place over the weekend as of lately   we have been arguing a lot more   mostly when we are far apart and have to call each other we argued mostly because i was anxious due to his texting frequency has gone down quite a bit since the start of the relationship and it concerns me that his feelings for me might have changed after the recent argument   he said to stop texting each other he would like some time and space to think as he isn t sure if we are right for each other or not and declare of breaking up but for now he said he would get back to me but also said if i am completely sure that i want to know his decision after some time has passed   which confuses me with his previous statement of just breaking up for now i know for a fact that he cares for me a lot and so do i after some time of contemplation and think back about what could have gone wrong   i texted him and tell him all of the things that i could have done better and offer lots of solution to accommodate his difficulty in the relationship   including moving closer to him and working on my anxious side we have a snap streak going on and he wants to continue the streak so we still sending pictures so there is still somewhat of a contact we also still share each other the location one more thing that i am hopeful about in this situation is that he told me he has done better in one of the aspect that we had problem out of nowhere he politely told me again that he want some time and the he just not gonna forget about me so just let him have some space and is trying to think after i texted him all of the solutions and the fault that i made to him   i am not texting him anymore cause i already tried my best to tell him how we can work on things as best as i could i decided to wait for him but i would like to ask everyone to understand more about the ambiguous behavior and do you think if we have a chance of reunion    i am also confuse if he still care for me so much   then why can t it be a break but a break up for now       thank you for your insight 
entp,i mean   really   what did you expect    happy i  ve noticed that there are a lot of ask a a question threads in the other forums   but nobody seems to want to ask an <type> a question that  s probably because you know you  re unlikely to get a serious or useful answer so now you can ask an <type> a question   with the full understanding that whatever you get as a response will be witty   sarcastic and less than totally accurate and   you know   somebody might actually give you a valid answer if they feel like it 
isfp,so i  ve been trying to figure out if i m a <type> instead of an <type> any advice or any differences that you notice    i feel like i focus a lot on fi and i think i m intuitive but i think i might be using ni instead of ne 
istj,hypothetically speaking if you had to choose would you rather lose all the memories    verbal kinetic emotional etc    that you have now but you re able to create new ones for the rest of your life or to keep all the memories that you have created but unable to create new ones after a    hours time span    sent from my iphone using tapatalk
esfp,never mind just delete this post   i overesmiated myself and no one would read such a long post 
enfp,i have a really bad death stare   to the point where people around me give me looks that suggest they think i m doing it on purpose because i do n t like them or i m having a bad day the truth is my face just falls this way naturally and for me to smile or at the very least not have a death stare would require consistent thought as <type>s   how does this come off to you   specifically in the context of people you do n t know giving you a death stare or seeing someone with one that is n t necessarily paying attention to or focusing on you    obviously   if you know an <type> that has one and you  re friends or in a relationship with them   things are going to be different   but from the perspective of a total stranger   i  d like to know how it registers with your type 
istj,hi guys   i have been in a friends with benefits situation with an <type>   whom i have liked since january we never ended up dating because back in jan   he said we have different beliefs when is comes to marriage and kids he did n t see himself committed where else i do we are both      so we kept it casual    i has also just come out of a    year abusive relationship      it was finally refreshing to be with someone that i can get along and feel like home with i am <type>   i feel a lot   he does n t have to say much but i do understand his emotions it  s like we communicate through our eyes not words he does know how i feel about him   because in feb i confessed about my feelings and then since we decided to not date   i went my separate ways a month later he messaged me asking how i was   and we started talking again i also realised i was n t ready for a relationship back in jan feb and i was still healing from my past relationship so decided   casual is the best option now come to july   we met after i was on holiday for   weeks and he texted me daily during my holiday    altho i initially told him let  s take a break from talking    after i met him   we ended up
entj,hey everyone   new poster here so i apologize if there are threads similar to this one most entries about <type>  s state that once their decision is made to break up with a partner   it  s final and there  s no looking back i just wanted to know what goes on in your heads when it  s over    especially if you were in a serious relationship and they were your first true love    from what i understand   <type>  s tend to not be sentimental and move on fairly quickly    do you guys ever think about your ex  s and if so what triggers that train of thought    places   songs   dreams   etc       how often do you think of them and how long does it take you guys to get over them    i know it varies from relationship to relationship and why you break up so i guess i  ll add some background as to why i m asking my boyfriend and i had been dating for a year and   months long distance and i was his first girlfriend he is fairly religious so he wanted to wait until he met someone really special at the pinnacle of our relationship he would baby me all the time   talk about our future and how he wanted to take care of me we  ve met each other  s parents and friends   went on short trips together and would fly to see each other every now and then we  ve had our fights but in the end we usually took them as signs of growth it was n t until i became really depressed    being far away from my friends and family and all    that things started getting a little messy initially we broke up because i became more needy and he told me he did n t know how to take care of me anymore if you are an <type> and broke up with your girlfriend   have you ever gotten back together with her    do you guys still have a sweet spot for that extra special someone    how do you guys move on so well    i m an <type> <type> so i m a very sentimental hopeless romantic type of girl

istp,hello everyone   sorry   y all it  s long and it  s full of <type>ness   hope you <type>s do n t get discouraged from reading laughing i m currently dating an <type> and i m an <type> type     we  ve only been dating for   months however   i feel incredibly one sided in this relationship i put a lot of effort    showing a lot of physical affection   words of affirmation   giving him gifts   etc      and when a problem arises for me   i try to communicate and find a common ground that makes both of us happy i feel like i m the only one putting any input into the problems   i  ll ask him what he thinks and he  ll say i do n t know i thought you guys were suppose to be fixers lol   he has an incredibly lazy and stoic demeanor and for the most part   i just assume he  s lazy because he never really does anything i propose   such as making any date plans to hang out with me in the future    i know you guys are known to be bad at this    but there will be many times he calls and ask to hang out and i m busy i find it incredibly selfish   he will just not ask for another day or anything and when i once felt i wanted to spontaneous and selfish and just showed up at his place without telling him and he said i was being inconsiderate    i agree   but literally do n t care   trying to be him for a day      and i get so tired being the initiator all the time   i just do n t even suggest an alternative anymore i feel like not a priority in his life   i feel taken advantaged of   and considering i m incredibly emotional   i feel emotionally starving and it  s been so unhealthy for me mentally   cause i m constantly trying to create turmoil to get attention because communicating does n t seem to work even when we talk about problems   he apparently does n t have any problem with me   but i have so many problems with him   but when we talk about it   he just never helps he listens   i know   but he does n t say anything and he does n t do anything to change anything i keep hearing you guys express it through action but he does n t really do much he  s pretty physically affectionate but i just think that ties in with sex he also sleeps alot when i m around   so quality time is n t really quality to me he occasionally smokes pot from what he says but i know potheads go to sleep alot but maybe it just depends on the person definitely does n t say anything romantic   i have to force it out of him by asking him do you like me like   times he will also hang out with his friends and get drunk alot   and will not text me all day night   it  s not the most important thing but it does make me feel undervalued in his priority list   considering everything else he has or well has n t done i get worried pretty easily   i  ve had alot of traumatic experiences with death of important people   so i really appreciate them updating me or at least telling me they  ll go mia he  s been better about it but i honestly dont think i have given this relationship enough time especially for an <type> i do n t know if i need to be more patient or just really cut this relationship   it  s been incredibly draining trying to carry his ass and leading this relationship   it  s like i m doing all the hardwork and he  s just behind me while i cut the obstacles in front of us also he  s incredibly broke   so we ca n t really go out and experience a lot of things so i try to pay from him once in a while but i felt so taken advantaged of   i just did n t feel good doing it anymore i  ve suggested to be fwb   see other people   instead of working towards a serious long term relationship or possibly an open relationship   so he does n t have to feel the pressure of what i expect in a relationship as much   but he  s highly against it and only wants us to see each other only i have no doubt he  s honest and faithful but it  s like he  s living a single lifestyle while wanting a girl with him without any obligations priorities responsibility of a partner it  s incredibly frustrating i give him a good amount of space cause i enjoy mines as well   but literally   if i do n t ask to hang out or just spontaneously do it   he will rarely ask how can this help maintain a healthy and exciting relationship       i also do n t know why he does n t just let me go   whenever i try to break up with him   he always sweet talks me into forgiving him and giving him another chance and resumes his unreliable and uncertain ways ugh   i just feel like we are so incredibly incompatible and my communication does n t get through to him and i m pretty direct i  ve asked people around me for their opinions and they all say to dump him because i deserve a lot better   but i think they  re biased cause they care for me so i want to see you <type>  s perspectives on his behaviors around me and i guess judge mines and what i can do better to accommodate to him but also be able to get more emotionally from an <type> i m not sure if i have anymore patience and literally just want to disappear and ignore his calls texts maybe just in spite of how i feel with him when he goes mia on me and leave the relationship at that i m really trying to save this relationship but it  s been really hard   he has n t proven to me that he  ll be a reliable partner in times of need   i mean he could just be too immature   he could also be too shy and needs lots of time to commit to that   he can also not be as interested enough to think it  s worth of an effort   etc he does n t even feel bad in this relationship and i am feeling like shit he fucks from time to time thoughts    maybe i just ca n t see the big picture or see the little changes that are happening    i have no fucking idea   i m confused   annoyed   and frustrated please and thank yous   other personality types are welcome to chime in too

isfp,as already pointed out in another forum   these should not be viewed to determine one  s type   but for information purposes only whether you agree with susan storm  s assessments or not   should not influence any from determining their best fit type as being <type>   you re extremely down to earth you take life as it comes and   according to typologists paul d tieger and barbara barron tieger   are the most unassuming and down to earth of all types    p      the art of speed reading people    you are very aware of the facts of life   and the reality of what is happening around you not much can rattle you because you tend to have a very grounded outlook   you show your affection through actions more than words you re typically not someone to verbalize a bunch of effusive praises to the people you love rather than whispering sweet nothings   you re more likely to shovel someone s snow or make them a mixtape your feelings   although deep   are very private and internally felt you tend to show your affection and love through acts of service and helpful gestures more than words of admiration   you are deeply affected by the pain or misfortune of others although you may seem mysterious and even stoic on the outside   you are deeply feeling on the inside you are tremendously affected by the pain   unhappiness   or trauma of others you instantly imagine how it must feel to be in their shoes this empathy tends to grow as you age and mature you might find yourself feeling intensely troubled   sensing a deep pain in your heart and a lump in your throat as you hear about the afflictions that others have experienced   you take a while to get to know you re not someone who immediately wears your heart on your sleeve you need to know that you can trust someone before you share your true feelings   your pain   or your tough experiences in life highly effusive   expressive people can be overwhelming to you and if they ask for a lot of details about your life it can make you feel anxious or even suspicious   you quickly notice what other people need because you are so observant and attentive to details   you are quick to notice when the people around you seem worried   stressed   cold   or uncomfortable in any way you re probably one of the first to offer a warm blanket to someone who is cold   or the first to go snuggle a pet that seems lonely or anxious for friendship   you try to hold space for people s unique differences it s crucial to you to be open minded to the experiences and worldviews of others while you hold strictly to your own beliefs   you also realize that everyone else is shaped by their unique life experiences you tend to be quietly accepting of others unless they are sharing beliefs that are condescending or harsh to your personal values   managing long range projects leaves you overwhelmed because you re more focused on the present than the future   it can be challenging for you to imagine how things are likely to play out projects that take a lot of focused   methodical attention and have a distant payout tend to be frustrating to you you like to get quick results and see an immediate result from what you are putting your energy into now   you are suspicious of sugarcoating and overly effusive behavior some people believe that feeling types want all their words wrapped up in words of praise   affirmation   or compliments for <type>s   this can actually be off putting these types like people who are straightforward and real with them authenticity and direct honesty are more important to them than cloying   sentimental words   you have a lot of aesthetic sense you notice the world around you in high definition detail details stand out blue isn t just blue   it s sapphire or egyptian blue or azure you notice what colors complement each other and enjoy perusing art museums or looking at different fashions to see which style best resembles you as an individual to you   colors   designs   clothing all of it can exemplify a part of your unique personality in a way that words just can t define    you crave creative freedom you enjoy toying with creative supplies and materials to come up with something completely unique you enjoy careers that allow you to be creative   whether that s through photography   marketing   cooking   hairstyling   performing   or many other avenues    you hate being rushed you weigh decisions for longer than most people   trying to understand the significance or value of each option in depth when people pressure you to make up your mind quickly   you feel irritable and resentful    you empathize with the underdog you are particularly drawn to oddballs   misfits   and misunderstood or marginalized people because of your individualistic nature   you appreciate people who march to the beat of their own drum    you re a closeted adrenaline junkie sure   you enjoy binge watching netflix and laboring over a creative project but there s also a side of you that is hungry for physical intensity and thrilling action whether you re rock climbing   dancing   or speeding past a slow driver you enjoy pushing yourself physically and getting a rush of independence and freedom as a result    you help people see options you have an eye for opportunities in the present moment   and you help people find resources and alternatives they may not have considered previously you tend to stay calm in a crisis and help people find creative ways out of difficult situations    you re drawn to the mysterious you enjoy spending time alone and imagining how the future could unfold conceptualizing new ways of seeing things can be very stimulating and energizing for you at the same time   you tend to distrust yourself when it comes to guessing how something will happen in the distant future when you re being creative your intuition really does shine   you enjoy doing creative projects where you can draw attention to mysterious or symbolic meanings    you hate rigid rules and structures you like being flexible and adapting to the needs of the moment rather than being stuck with guidelines that tie you down you feel like life is unpredictable   and as a result   it s better to be able to go with the flow rather than check in with your schedule to make sure everything is running according to a strict plan    you dislike giving negative feedback critiquing people is something that tends to send shivers up your spine you like to create an atmosphere of openness and quiet warmth   not an atmosphere of defensiveness and shame because of this   you tend to put off giving criticism or give it as gently as humanly possible    you think better when you re surrounded by beauty sitting in a stale cubicle is probably one of the worst ways for you to hand in your best work your creativity and focus blossom when you are surrounded by lush colors or ethereal landscapes you often work well outdoors   in the wilderness   or in an area that you ve made your own with beautiful details that inspire you    you crave independence nothing fills you with more joy than venturing out on your own to do something meaningful stepping onto an airplane   roaming around in your car   or taking a risk on a career that aligns with your values    even if it dismays your more traditional parents    fills you with a sense of purpose and peace you don t like being tied down to someone else s dreams   rules   or demands    you enjoy binge watching netflix when you re stressed okay   a lot of people do this   but your type especially enjoys television as a stress reliever    according to the mbti manual    when you ve had a bad day   you enjoy piling up some comfy pillows and blankets   gathering your favorite snacks   and having a marathon of your favorite shows    speaking of stress   you become more critical when you re burned out normally gentle and tolerant   when you re severely stressed   your personality can change unexpectedly you might blurt out sarcastic or critical comments at people who are bothering you or get caught up in rage fueled fantasies often you feel like everyone else is being lazy   inefficient   or incompetent you can find out more about your stress reaction here    schedules feel confining for you   bedtime is when you re tired   and mealtime is when you re hungry you follow your instincts as you go through your day rather than structuring everything out family rituals where you have to rush through plans and schedules with a lot of other people tend to exhaust you    you don t want to control others you hate the idea of invading anyone s space whether it be a human or an animal your live and let live mentality makes you a go to friend for people who need space and freedom you believe that every entity on this planet deserves personal freedom   respect   and a sense that their life is their own road to trailblaze    later in life you find more satisfaction in order if you re in your   s or   s   you ve probably reached a point where you can organize your tasks and projects more easily it s easy for you to lay out reasonable explanations for things and you can argue your points with veracity when you were younger   this was much more difficult for you 
esfp,hello <type>s   in this interview   i talked to tiana and jany about their similarities and differences as standard and jumper <type>s this was honestly one if not my most favourite <type> interview yet we started the interview by talking about their most significant difference where tiana    standard <type>    is self above tribe while jany    jumper <type>    is tribe above self jany had the quote of the day when she released an explosive double masculine sleep last rant between the   minute to      minute mark of the interview another great takeaway from the interview is tiana being double introverted feels like she  s letting other people down with the demon te while jany feels like she  s letting herself down with demon fi it was also interesting that what made them happy was completely opposite for jany who is a double extrovert   happiness to her is alone time being introspective or doing what she loves for tiana   it  s using her blast and being productive since she is blast last i also learned that one of the most important things when talking to <type>s is getting to their core because outside their se lead is that deep nf sleep watch this interview here

esfp,first of all   if you  re about to post you  re a typist   go away   it wo n t help anybody observations i see <type>s as pot smoking guys who do n t care about anything but their friends and themselves in their   s   they may start to care about things like corporations and the government or other righteous things they love to party   preferably with their friends   a close group of friends or their friends   but do n t mind strangers partying sometimes includes other drugs rather than weed   combined with lots and lots of alcohol likely to be smokers as they wanted to be cool generous   would share a chocolate that costs    kg that he just got from his grandma overseas with a friend  s friend just because he  s there with him at that moment ca n t be trusted to do something they promise   likely to just forget it may even skip a class because they forgot about it   or a driving lesson   even if it costs     to retake it and they do n t have it do n t know if the following is country specific   but do n t like to work   unless it  s illegal and relatively easy very impulsive   prefer to set schedule    minutes before it happens   an hour tops oddly   when young seem to want some kind of fame   but that may be mistaken for the wish to be accepted due to their social skills and rather charming personality   some may consider them a leader   assuming it  s a group of friends always have a story to tell   whether their own or someone else  s often it  s someone else  s though pay attention to the stories of others   if it  s happened to someone else   it  s the truth sort people into respected and disrespected   depending on how their interests match have a moral code   once an <type> even gave back what he stole from a guy in an online game because he felt bad about it loves animals   may stop and pet a stray dog or a cat on the street do n t mind stuff that may harm them   life is short   live good   die young kinda folks do n t mind getting lost in thought when doing something   so concentration skills when under stress may be violent or do immoral stuff   like stealing from the less respected friends or insulting them do n t mind making fun of friends or others as long as it  s between friends neglect any logical discussion unless it  s one on one a partner leaving them may cause great stress that can last even for a month or a bit more and may lead into more than usual drug abuse do n t like talking about love or romance   especially if it  s related to them may annoy the hell out of an <type> by asking countless why    questions about stuff that i see as intuitive and if i take the time to explain it   may just stick a too serious sticker on it great activity partners gaming   whether computer or real world and sports i bet that part of the observations are either generalizations or unrelated   so feel free to comment or post your observations and discuss

istj,hello fellow <type> females   please help this guy in distress i  ve been dating this <type> girl for the past   months at the beginning it was great   she was n t the most exciting women in bed but there was a deep connection and that mattered more than anything else we had sex pretty often   basically every time we saw each other now things changed a lot   even though we spend the entire weekend together   nothing happens between us when we go to bed together   she just falls asleep cuddled with me this has been eating my heart alive   even though she is just right there besides me   i feel a great distance between and makes me feel unwanted it  s horrible   i m not even seeking sex   just some sort of intimate connection i  ve raised her attention to it   i  ve been very comprehensive   i told her that i have needs and feelings too she basically gets on her nerves very quickly and tells me she is not in the mood for it and in should respect that i tried explaining her   like many things in life   even though we are tired or not in the mood   sometimes when we start we end up getting into the mood and enjoying it she did n t seem to understand at all and went south with the argument so i dropped it fellow <type> ladies   how do you approach intimacy    should i expect this to be just a phase    i m afraid this is not something i  ll be able to tolerate in a regular basis 
intj,if you  re an <type> describe your appearance i  ll start i m  ft   with long brown curly hair i have hazel eyes and a nose thats kinda big crying disclaimer i m probably stupid to ask this question because your personality type and appearance do n t usually connect   but i m just curious laughing 
intj,i  ll tell you why because it makes groups of people feel good to come together in recognition of a mutual enemy regardless of whether that enemy is right or not   people will be their best selves   in the presence of someone who does n t automatically support their miserable   day to day   worldviews and the morality of simple co existence 
esfj,you know you  re an <type> when    insert funny observations below    happy 
isfp,sometimes i learn something about the world   some new connection it links up in a way that makes it feel i  ve leveled up it usually happens when i explore some new system of knowledge and i realize how it connects to something i already understand it is like the floodgates are opened and i feel like a god or something i know this is a perfect example of jungian inflation where my weak ni gets overconfident and think i m smarter than anyone else still i m actually smarter as a byproduct of the realization   it really did level me up   but i overestimate how much smarter i got i  ve found that a good way to get my feet on the ground is trying to write the knowledge down in some document forcing myself to try to te out the insight really shows me how weak a grip i have on it it also makes me better at the thing i leveled up in   so it is all good   even if my ego feels fully deflated anyone else can relate to some of this    
esfp,i was perusing the <type> thread and noticed a lack of stickied threads   then i felt like i would help out happy i  ve only seen this in two other threads but both seemed to do fairly well   so ask an <type> a question   i shall ask one right now   stephen might you sticky this thread perchance    edit and they need a photo thread sticky   http personalitycafe com <type> forum performers        dis my face html double edit well sticky if they want it stickied do n t want to be that guy everyone that reads will know what i m talking about lol

intj,am late for work but will edit later to insert all the tact general shot across bows for people unfamiliar with the recurring derails on the original gooey feels thread this is not a conversational milieu you  re welcome to read   but it  s important to understand that people posting here are not inviting a conversation about what they post and they wo n t welcome it expanding here to say this should be assumed to include such one on one channels as private messages and comments on the poster  s visitor wall so if you feel an urge to advise a poster   tell a poster your own feelings based on their feels   think you know the answers or just generally have an opinion that was n t asked for   please take it outside of this thread and even then   be aware that unless the poster has actually said they would n t mind being approached   the chances are still pretty good that you  ll be crossing a line no matter how good your intentions are   no matter how much you feel like you  ll die if you do n t get to chip in informal studies have shown that <type>s    and for all i know other types too    genuinely appreciate having a place where they can express themselves without entering into some implicit  social contract  that obligates them to put up with other people  s two cents about whatever they have just said those who get it wo n t need that justified and those who do n t can no longer say they were n t warned thank you i made minor edits to this   by the way

estp,i experienced different types of you all just truly admire the woman who is a role model to me throughout my childhood   the friend that works hard for his single mother   the bully that pushes my limit   the teacher that taught me to grow   and the man i dated with whom fulfilled me    sadly taken and psychologically unstable    even the fictional characters that are my duals like perry miller   georgia   and oskar schindler    i do n t know why   i just find your heroic actions so enchanting 
istj,<type>  s and <type>  s tend to be considered rival types and having not met many i was just wondering what exactly are the different traits that fuel our rivalry   i get that we  re mostly opposites but what exactly are the worst things <type>  s do that piss you off    
intp,i wanna see how this goes   since i know our minds are sporadic as ever and although many of you will try to refine your posts   i urge you not to go over and over with extensive amounts of editing just post the little   random   complex   enlightening thought that you currently are holding in your head mine as      approaches i have realized that i am experiencing the onset of another decade of human life passing me by i have made it    years on this planet   gone through so many different friendships and scenarios of drama that have shaped me into quite the interesting person i am today i have experienced heart break   death   depression   enlightenment   revelation   and a change in spiritual belief my constant search for inner and outer knowledge has not changed yet the path to obtain this has wavered and been manipulated in a multitude of ways through my life i am wondering if my interest in a career in astronomy will stay true as college approaches or will my newfound love for chemistry take over    or will one of the random inspirational hobbies that pop up in my life become my future path    
intp,post your bad jokes here jokes that you  ve heard that were bad   or jokes that you  ve told that were just bad    it  s up to you what bad means      i am working on a lengthy one now    a long story joke    but here  s a smaller one  til i get done with that one a couple is driving down a highway in texas    for those not in us aware   it is the largest state in the us   sans alaska    their car runs out of gas   but they see a large building ahead who knows    it could be a gas station they decide to take the trek together unfortunately   the walk was much longer than they expected seconds turned to minutes   minutes turned to hours   and well you get the gist finally   after several hours   they arrived the structure was so large   it looked like a small    but close    building from so far away   a large sign hung from the massive doors on the front gym  s steaks what kind of name is that    the couple thought pushing through the massive door   they are greeted and finally directed to a table the table was big enough to hold at least eight people   and it was clearly the smallest table around ironically   there were very few people in sight drinks    the waiter asked after giving them an order a simple coke and water   the waiter left   leaving two very large menus the man turned to his wife   and said i guess what they say is true   everything is bigger in texas they chuckled   and looked at the menu after a few minutes the waiter returned with massive drinks in hand he set down the two gigantic jugs   and asked   sowly   arrre y all ready fer yer ordah    smiling to themselves   they each ordered a steak and sides the only thing really available here and the waiter moved on looking around   they began to comment an incredibly large rocking chair was on a center stage the chair was at least the height of two tall men   and the width of one as well a small ladder was propped up beside it   as if people actually used the rocking chair magnificent trinkets adorned the wall yokes for oxen at least twice the normal size   black and white pictures of dogs and horses twice the size of humans    obviously photoshopped      and a few tools at least thrice their normal size after talking a while on the subject and absolute absurdness of the environment   their steaks finally arrived the waiter   holding a massive tray   lowered it for the couple to see there   sitting on the massive tray   were four massive plates two huge steaks   and two heaping piles of various sides they were so surprised   neither said a word was this customary    they thought as they stared the waiter placed the plates on the table and left a few speechless moments past   until the woman finally said i guess it is true they both began to laugh quietly after a while   the steaks began to disappear the waiter stopped by several times   and finally both had consumed quite a lot and quite a bit of their drinks   where are the restrooms    the man said   standing and holding his stomach the waiter told him   and off he went following a very long hallway   the man was amused by all of the pictures and other devices along the walls he passed several doors   each very large but without signs did he say the second to last on the right    he took a guess   and opened that door it was completely dark   but he remembered the man saying something about the light being off tile floors   so must be it he stumbled in   trying to find the light switch   but it was so dark finally   he slipped and fell into a large swimming pool panicking   he shouted do n t flush   do n t flush   oh my god   please do n t flush   as he climbed out of the pool    later he realized why it was called gym  s steaks    so ya   that  s a bad one for ya i am terrible at telling story like jokes irl   so post your bad ones    and experiences    here   
infp,hello <type>s and <type> forum i have some <type>s that i dearly love in my life   but a few of my friends and myself have been severely hurt by <type>s in non platonic ways i have identified a pattern of romantic destruction    yes i am an sj    that these <type>s have committed in each instance to hurt me or my non <type> friends here they are stating that they want one thing    ex playing the friend card   the casual sex card    but really secretly wanting another ex secretly seeking a serious monogamous relationship   then being disappointed with their partner for not doing it   even though they did not ask for it   and did not clearly state their wants or needs saying they never loved or felt anything for a partner   but only at the end when everything is all over when the <type> says this   it usually causes their partner to further distance or to end things the <type> usually denies romantic involvement when the relationship hits a certain pass fail point that requires good communication skills   not passivity or denial why would anyone want to continue a relationship with someone who felt nothing for them    seriously wtf      for example   one <type> started referring to us as true love   and would always bring us up in the context of true love we got together all the time   like every other day we had been emotionally close for years anyway however   six months later   at the end of things   i asked him if he ever felt anything for us and he denied it   saying his interest in me was only in a fascinated way   and never in a romantic way which one is the truth    what he said at the end   or what he said six months before the end    setting secret traps or hoops for the romantic partner to jump through if the partner foibles    like all human beings do      or if the partner does not somehow read minds or magically infer how they are supposed to respond to each secret trap   the <type> is disappointed   many times going completely emo yet the <type> does this all as an unspoken agenda   so that nearly every potential romantic partner fails it is like a secretive confirmation bias when the <type> starts looking for something to be wrong with their romantic partner that is not really there   they will end up making it happen confirmation bias is a law that you will find what you look for if you look for red   or the letter a while driving down a highway   you will find it same thing with romance if you start looking for things to be wrong   or focusing on them   you will make mountains of mole hills then after that the <type> can begin to blow off the potential romantic partner as worthless   or as non relationship material one example at the height of the classic pass fail point    that every relationship either makes it or breaks it here    the <type> tells me he will never have a relationship again   that it is too painful so i follow his word as clear   literal   concrete truth   that he is not into me   etc etc then when i tell him i am dating others and begin treating him as a friend   he decides to silent treat me he then states he will be less and less available in the future and that is not apologizing for it he then states we never had a relationship   yet at the same time   he treats it exactly like a relationship break up   rather than a friendship when said <type> says we never had a relationship   i take it as the clear truth   so i treat him as a friend yet when i do this   he gets disappointed in me my friends and myself have considered swearing off dating <type>s forever we do not know of one who has had a lasting successful relationship my friends began making bad <type> jokes about losing wallets   thinking weapons are flashlights   needing <type> enemas for all the shit they read wrongly into other  s actions   etc so   why would an <type> say one thing   then turn around and say another    why would an <type> stop seeing other people and commit to a partner because it would be wrong not to then later down the road   tell that person you never meant anything to me i never felt anything i can tell you as a sensor   if i love someone   i love them end of story if they hurt me   they hurt me if there was something between us   then there was and always will be   even if it did not last i would never wait until the end and say i never loved so and so to me   that seems extremely emotionally sadistic do <type>s pretend to feel    do they pretend to love someone    is this why they deny ever loving someone at the end    
intj,i used to be very much into weight lifting i have a sort of innate intelligence for it my body is also naturally hypertrophic i m built like a caveman and it was my obsession until i had an accident preventing me from doing it    probably forever    so i now work for myself from my computer indoors i m also accompanied by a host of health problems i  ve set my goals towards chasing millions   but i realize this wo n t be fulfilling or probably even that rewarding this is probably the first time in    years that i  ve not really had some over arching long term goal to propel me forward in life i do have goals   but due to ongoing health issues   i ca n t consistently or reliably do them when i want to i find i m interested in topics such as space   physics and philosophy   but not much more as i see it   if i ca n t use my body then i can use my mind and what is more interesting than trying to unravel the mysteries of the universe   understand existence   or encompass the entirety of reality in ones mind although the big problem is that my intelligence constrains me from actually pursuing these subjects to any level that is worthwhile   or any level that would make it feel fulfilling to me i feel like i m going through life running software that constantly exceeds my hardware  s capability there is a lot of curiosity and interest   but not enough processing power to actually run the program to a level that would produce anything worth running the program in other words   you really cannot do much in terms of physics or philosophy with an average or slightly above average iq you just ca n t people will say you can   but you really ca n t you could spend years and years learning only for someone with an iq north of     spending a month on the subject and completely blow you out of the water and anything you achieve will be pointless in the grand scheme you will constantly be fighting against the grain and hit your intellectual ceiling on these subjects very early since i lost the only thing i ever truly enjoyed   at this point i really only want to do something if i feel i can reach a high level of understanding and actually accomplish something the monotonous daily grind of a full time job or even being self employed and running some online ecommerce stores aka being entrepreneur financially successful still feels unfulfilling but without a higher intelligence there is n t really much you can chase after that would be this has led me to odd subjects like conspiracy theories   remote viewing   subjective probabilistic theories of reality   spirituality   meditation   aliens   etc but at the back of my mind   i know they are likely all fiction and i m just trying to latch onto something interesting   fulfilling   mysterious   etc i  ve always been avoidant and disliked being around people   found friends who i actually liked still predictable and boring girlfriends and such are the same ultimately when you combine this kind of mentality with an <type> personality and all that comes with it you have a recipe for disaster my issac newton type lifestyle would be justifiable if i had an issac newton iq it  s gotten so bad i  ve been considering living in an rv next to a creek or a shack in the woods does anyone else feel something similar to this apologies if this is all over the place   it  s very late 
esfj,like the title says seems like most other types have a sticky thread like this   so thought it was time we get one started here too
