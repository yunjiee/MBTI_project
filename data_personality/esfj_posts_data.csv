"Like the title says. Seems like most other types have a sticky thread like this, so thought it was time we get one started here too."
"I haven't seen any on here and I'm pretty curious about them
Do they just never go online?"
You know you're an ESFJ when..........(insert funny observations below) :happy:
"Ok, so I thought I'd give this a bash.

After having a wander through the ENTP section I noticed their (sticky) ""confession thread"", which they themselves got the idea for in the INTP section. A good one to read through for both humour and, sometimes, some insight. Our ESFJ section is a bit low on sticky threads, and this seems like a bit of a laugh if nothing else. So go on, post your confessions.

Since I've started I'll go first... bit of a pathetic one this I admit to start with:

I'm usually one of the first people in the office in the morning and I'll usually race to be first to the coffee machine to get a brew going. My colleagues think I'm being decent and helpful for doing this. Reality, I secretly think they are rubbish at measuring out the correct amount of coffee, and I want to ensure I enjoy my morning coffee at the strength I like it ."
"Not going to lie, when I check on these threads and things move soooooooo slowly and there's like nothing new ever... I'm totally like: I wish  @orion83uk and  @Suntide and any other ESFJs out there were here to just catch up. Like how's everyone's day going or whatever else is on your mind. HA! 

I'm such an ESFJ... lol"
"Heyyyy!  I was searching and couldn't find an ESFJ Pictures thread!  So all you FINE ESFJs... let's show PerC how easy we are on the eyes!  ))))

Let's make this fun and POST!"
"I'm just wondering why people pin ESFJs down as being one of the most unbearable types because, personally, I don't see anything about you guys' functions that would make you unlikable.

Fe--group oriented, like to make everyone feel welcome, empathetic, caring
Si--remember little sensory details
Ne--explores possibilities
Ti--not so great at applying subjective logic?


Obviously, my description of the functions ^ was extremely watered down, but even so, whats so offensive about that combination?

I don't get it."
"Y'all Esfjs deal with a lot of rubbish in your daily lives and it can show quite easily...

Vent here and let me help you preserve your mental health!"
"Please try not to go all Fe  and say ""I would get along with any healthy type"". Be brutally honest ESFJs, you are given so much hate on these forums, which type is NOT your type? And why?"
"I have recently started dating an INTP, and we have gotten really into reading about our respective personality types. Interestingly, he has found countless forums by INTPs, has had enjoyed reading about others' experiences as his same type. I, however, have found no forums for ESFJs! I am surprised by this, given that as an ESFJ, I love to talk to other people, especially people with whom I have something in common. And yet, no ESFJs seem to be interested in the least in talking about themselves. This shouldn't be terribly surprising, as ESFJs are caregivers, and on many of the profiles I have read about how much we enjoy talking about other people. Perhaps we should start a forum called, ""What ESFJs think about everyone else""? That might get the conversation going.

In all honesty, though, I would find it very helpful to compare notes, as it were, with others like me. Let's get this ball rolling, shall we?

Here's a few topics of conversation:
* Interesting especially to me, how does an ESFJ get along with the polar opposite type, the INTP? I have found it to be a delightful match, certainly a complementary one, as long as sights are set outward and communication is open.
* Has anyone taken the Enneagram test? I find many common characteristics between my ESFJ-ness and my Enneagram 2-ness. What are other people's Enneagram types?
* From a faith perspective, how does your ESFJ type relate to your faith (in my case, Christian faith, but really any faith)? Do you believe, as I do, that some of the best characteristics of your type are directly related to your efforts to live into the ideals of your faith?
* What has been your experience in friend relationships? Do you find yourself to be a better or worse friend than others? How about your romantic relationships?"
"Have any esfj females dated an istj. I ask because esfjs are one of my preferred personalities to have a relationship with. As far as I know I’ve never dated one, it’s not like I have everyone I go out with take a mbti test. I’m a pretty healthy istj male by the way. Just curious how the relationship was."
"ESFJs, do y’all do this? Asking cuz I think I might be one too. I’m 16 and still in high school, it may be different.

Have the tendency to ask others before making a decision on things. Like not just one or two people but like everyone in regards to a decision. I’m also an enneagram 6 for the record.

Get off topic easily and can be random and weird. My friends say I can be very random and weird, because I can be very open with people (say talking about kinks when most people don’t talk about that stuff) and I swear a lot, and I have the tendency to get off topic easily and connect unrelated things together.

Push your values onto others without meaning to. I can do this a lot without meaning to, like if someone has an opposing view of something (say homosexuality), I’ll have the tendency to try and make them change their opinion on it, even though it’s their opinion.

Quit something when it gets difficult. I’ve had the tendency to quit something when it gets difficult, like in 5th grade, I was in art club and didn’t get the hang of sewing and I felt embarrassed and judged because the 4th graders understood it better than me and didn’t return to the club for a few meetings. I came up with excuses until my parents forced me back into it and broke down crying.

Being indecisive and disorganized. I am really disorganized and suck at being on time and I’m also really indecisive, hence why I ask for opinions on everything.

Suck at building a routine and getting out of habits. Here’s the thing: I don’t mind a routine as long as it’s not too boring. I’d prefer a routine because I can be very disorganized but the routine never lasts. I also suck with bad habits or trying to build new ones. They never last more than a day or two.

Not rebellious. I have really strict parents and looking back on my childhood, sometimes I wonder why I didn’t really rebel as a child. Like I was forced to wear uniform at a public school so my parents could make me proper because we couldn’t afford private school and I didn’t really even question it. Like I just accepted it and was like “yeah they’re strict”. Only when ninth grade happened I didn’t want to wear them anymore and put my foot down and they agreed. Or other things like I wanted to dye my hair, but decided against it (mind you I’m 16) because I was afraid of what they would think. I already knew I would be getting in trouble with taking my braids out (cuz I’m black) but I did it anyway to feel a little rebellious. Like some of my other friends don’t mind arguing or being rebellious but it’s like I struggle with that. Only recently you could say I’ve been rebellious, but it’s like minuscule things.

Overly caring about what others think of you. I really care about what other people think of me. I can be sarcastic, yet I am horrible at understanding sarcasm. I did this a lot last year where I would constantly ask if others were mad at me, if they hated me, if I’d done something to upset them because I didn’t want the friendship to end and I felt I ruined it.

Being open and without a filter. Like I can be pretty open but I don’t really have a filter. Like I’ll be opening up Wattpad in the middle of class with the most random and weird stuff without shame. I’ll do weird stuff like that. Or talk about stuff most people won’t. But it’s weird; like I care a lot of what others think of me. If I don’t get a negative reaction, then I’ll do it, but when I get a negative reaction, I’ll stop and apologize and then overthink what I had done and then I’ll feel embarrassed that I did it.

Being affected by others mood. To be honest, I never really understood this being attributed to Fe, but it happens to me a lot through TV. Like characters will be having an argument and I’ll feel that and I’ll feel anxious and want to resolve it, but obviously, it’s TV, so I can’t do anything about it. (EDIT: okay so I kinda realize more what this means; I don’t really understand the whole “if you see someone crying, you start crying as well” because I don’t really know any Fe users that do that but I’ll definitely want to try and help them out, especially if they’re my friend, and try to make them feel better, and if they’re a stranger, I’ll wonder what’s troubling them if there’s nothing I can do and if they’re okay and I’ll worry about them basically).

Personality change depending on who I’m with. I feel like this goes for everyone, but it’s more notable between friends and family. With family, I can be more reserved, quiet, like I’d probably be pegged as an introvert, like an ISTP or something because I’m the opposite compared to with friends, I’m more lively and energetic and outgoing. With strangers, it varies.

EDIT: After lots of research, I’m pretty confident in saying I’m an ESFJ, but I still want y’all’s opinion if y’all can relate or not."
"I'm genuinely wondering here.  So far SFJs have me stumped.  I try to explain everything in as clear and explicitly logical a manner as possible and I get... nothing.  The SFJ skirts around my argument and ignores it completely.  I realise I'm going about it the wrong way, but if I lay it out clearly enough, surely the most basic logic must be understood?

Honestly, I'm meant to be irritating you, not the other way around.  How do I go about communicating with an ESFJ?"
"I've just taken Michael Caloz's test, and the top 2 results were ENFP and ESFJ. I would have been an ENFP if my Si wasn't as high. Both my Fe and Fi are on an equal level; what I need to discover is which one I developed first. The test showed that I use very little Ti and no Ni.









						The Michael Caloz Cognitive Functions Test
					

Want to better understand who you are? Unlike other 16-types tests, this one goes way beyond the usual 4 letters to explore the deeper cognitive functions.

I'm not an ISTJ, as my Fe is too high for that. My Fe has been doing keys of ketamine and taking ecstasy pills, it has no real (Se) conception of reality, and without Ti, I have to process my ideas through other people before I trust my perceptions of what's going on around me. If it developed first, then ENFP ESE might be just as likely.
What confuses me is how I could be typed as a Ne-dom if I scored 100% on the judging trait (conscientiousness) on the Big 5/ 16 Personalities test:

100% organised seems too high for a type that revels in chaos and may also be higher in trait neuroticism. At least now I know that I'm the ESFJ and my grandma is an ENFP, not the other way around."
"I have broken my ex-gf ESFJ trust by saying break up.

I carelessly decided to break up with her..too fast to decide

She said she tried to move on suddenly I told her that.
But we still live together as I ask her if I still can live with her (because I still want to take care of her) and she’s okay.

I asked her why we can’t come back even she knows how I feel.
She said because I’ve broken her trust.

The question is..is it possible to rebuild trust?

Or how can I make this situation better?"
"I finally met an ESFJ!

She is really cool! I am an INFJ, and we vibe in a way that is unreal. For the first time in my life, I have felt like someone texts me more than I text them!

Some traits I notice:

Very friendly and engaging with people
Willing to speak her mind with no reservations and full confidence
No arrogance, just confidence
Self-awareness of her own inner self
Diminished awareness of the outside world/perspective
Genuine concern and empathy (Fe) and emotional response
Expressive texting! Lots of exclamation points and I always know how she feels about anything
Willing to bring up when her feelings are hurt immediately without letting it sit (it was a misunderstanding)
Able to reflect humor on an even level (first time I've laughed well in a long time (still not a hard laugh, still hurting... but close!))
Funny in a natural way; not seeking it out or going for a punch line
Very focused on the person she's talking to; where I deliberately use my Fe it is effortless for her
Knows where to get good food (Si/Ne)
Friendly to a level where it can seem like very direct flirting

I could go on I'm sure. I'm really impressed. I can't remember a time where I was texted/talked to this much, where I felt like it was almost too much! And I do mean almost! And feel! Because it could never be too much! But yeah it's really interesting how this ESFJ/INFJ dynamic is.

I don't even know where we connect; when I first met her it wasn't like anything specific stood out. Something, but what? Dunno. But then the next time it was like instant good friendship. I can't connect the dynamic to anything I know. It's so different to me. It's not normal for me, and probably not ""comfortable"" to me either. Meaning, she has all these ideas to do things and so on, and I am down for whatever, but also the amount is not normal (edit: not normal for me) - her Si in creating sensory things (going places, doing things, etc) is her output of her energy, and I am inferior-Se where I can only handle so much before I feel like I hit my limit.

It's so cool.

Writing this is just helping me sort out my thoughts. I can tell now, that all the sensory input I've been getting (long, frequent texts back and forth with all the alert sound notifications, audio-recorded messages she sends, going places and planning to do other things) is a lot for me to take with my inferior-Se. I can handle it, but also at some point my head is stuffed, my Se full, needing no more input. So I need to find a way to ensure I properly recover in-between hanging out, and to limit my sensory exposure during those times, not indulging in anything sensory, instead keeping it like a trickle-intake where when I do ""fill up"" my Se, it's at the end of the time spent hanging out and then yeah there's still gonna be a lot of texts after lmao... so yeah... lol... it's just good.

Anyway, it is awesome to see this personality type in person for the first time (consciously knowing it) and all the dynamics. Very direct, enjoys listening to other peoples' stories, gives great practical feedback and so much more. The Si is probably the most interesting component, because it (Si) creates sensory experiences - going places, doing things, and so on. I'm not used to this - Si is the function I've had the least exposure to before. I'm just pulled into doing these things, willingly, but also like I cannot help it! It's so strange because I haven't had that before, mostly dealing with Se users. So yeah it's like... alright we're gonna do this thing this week! And there's no stopping it, it's like an excitement or a wave that cannot be stopped.

And the texts/audio messages! I try to be as deliberate as possible in responding in-kind to everything I can, and it's a lot! I still have two audio messages from a few days ago I still need to catch up on, and that's so unlike me! But yeah.

Lots of exclamation!! lol...

So yeah. ESFJ you guys are pretty cool in my book."
What personality type shares you in their lives for example likes to make you feel important/special? Someone who is not private and works well with an Esfj?
"I recently got to know an ESFJ guy in a game and well, I must say he is a pretty awesome. I enjoy the affection, the attention. He’s also quite funny. I like him a lot.

But I seem to piss him off more often than I should. Ok so I have this tendency to think too deeply about things and I work through my emotions with people, on the fly. And I’ve done this a couple of times with him and he’s always not taken it very well. I used to date an INTJ and ISTP and both were super calm and walked me through it. I’m guessing it’s because he’s more emotionally in tune.

Most recently, I got mad at myself for not performing well in a team fight and said that I was unhappy. I have told him that it’s not him that’s making me upset (though he’s in the equation because he could have joined me in the battle) but he seems to be taking it personally and I suspect it’s because he can’t fix the situation and make me feel better.

He has said that when I’m happy he’s happy.

And I think I legit pissed him off. He’s been curt and said he doesn’t know how to talk to me (in case it trips me up). He also said I think too much and asked me to stop doing it (i.e. delving into things that are not true and not there).

I can feel the ... unhappiness. So how do I approach him. Should I leave him alone? I already said sorry."
ESFJs dispel a myth about your type!
"I hear that's the ideal partner for an isfp I don't know if I have ever even met an Esfj? so wondering what it's like to date one? From some of what i read on the 16 personality's website it sounded like someone I would wanna date.
So yeah any input on this would be great  also where to find one? since im introverted lol and im female btw if that makes any difference."
"I want to confess to this ESFJ, but I have doubts..

Ok so it's been 3 months that we've known each other.

So I'm running a small cafe and She is my current and only barista (the rest of employees are my family members).

She's 21 and I am 23, she still go to college. She wanted to get a part-time job so here we are. I made her took a personality test during the interview.

At first , we were pretty professional. But now, I feel like everyday is a date with her lol. It has been like this after we spent the first 3 weeks.

I found so many signs that she's interested with me more than a friend, here are some strong examples..

- She's blushing everytime we stare at each other. You know, that awkward smile as we both couldn't contain it any longer lol

- When we're across the room,  I often found that she's staring or at least paying attention to me and just me.

- Her face is light up everytime I enter the room and smile

- She teases me a lot like a lot in a very playful way and sometimes act very silly around me (like, she's pretending to faint then literally fall on the floor, she's jumping around like a rabbit as she said goodbye, etc)

- She leans in and gets closer to me whenever we have conversations, sometimes our body touch. She also sometimes slap my shoulder or arms whenever she gets excited.

- When there's no customers, she always ask me to have fun together, like watching movies together or playing games (Hago) together. And when we do this, we sit really close sometimes our thighs touch.

- She always try to keep the conversation going, even sometimes when I'm busy with my laptop, she keeps bothering me, curious abt what I'm working on, trying to get my attention in general. I think she doesn't like it when I'm ignoring her.

- Everytime she buy or cook food, she either buy it for me too or share her food with me (if she's lacking money)

- Compliments? Oh cmon, I received this a lot from her.

Sounds perfect right?
Not until, later on, I found out that she has a boyfriend. Thanks to my detective capabilities. cough cough

Well, secret boyfriend, to be specific.

So, she never mentioned him at all, even I later realized he ever came to my cafe once, but she only introduced him to me as his friend.

Wow.

She also hides him from public, I think only her very close relatives know the truth about them.

There are so many strange things about their relationship though. None of them ever post and brag about them being together on social media publicly. And, compared to her previous bf, this one is totally different, previous one was handsome good-looking guy while this one is like the total opposite. I am not being racist just spitting fax okayy. I can only assume, is he her rebound or something? Did she get traumatized because handsome guy could ditch her anytime? But she has been with this guy for almost a year. Is rebound even that long? I don't think zo.

Ok, so, damn I'm so CONFUSED man.

I have made sure that she doesn't treat her other male friends like how she treats me. Even, she doesn't play hago with his boyfriend , but only with me!

And this few facts below only confuse me even more

- She has made up her mind to make my cafe as her thesis project, and she also want to have an official internship in my cafe. So she planned at least 1 year ahead involving me in her life. She also try to find ways to meet with me outside of working hours (she asks my help for her homeworks, teach several subjects, etc.)

- She even pleaded to me not to leave her for my other job (so I'm currently looking for a job and have considered to take some time off from my cafe for some period of time)

So what she did? She asked me to give her my CV, then she keeps sending me job recommendations NEARBY so I won't be far and still around, since I ever told her I wanted to get a job in foreign countries.

She also hates it everytime I have to leave from my cafe for some business reasons, she always show disappointment in her faces and tell me ""please be quick and come back ok""

Last but not least, she has asked us to take selfies together and SHE WANTED TO UPLOAD THEM on social media, but I refused. The first time this happened, it happened during our first week. Lol. Though we ended up taking selfies and share to each other only. Lol

Idk, maybe because I refused to share them publicly so she thought that I don't have feelings for her. Ey? I also ever told her that ""I don't want people to get the wrong idea about us, I'm worried it would give negative effects to my cafe since I'm the owner.""

But still, she already has boyfriend. Why would she even want to do that with me? She hides her boyfriend but wanted to show me off to the world, wait did I hear that wrong??

Oh, I almost forgot. One night she's about to buy herself a new eye glasses and asked my opinions as she browsed the marketplaces (we were together sitting on a sofa in my cafe) And she ended up buying with the one I recommended. Wait. WHY DIDN'T SHE ASK FOR HER BF OPINION INSTEAD?

I also know that her relationship with her boyfriend is just alright, despite it's an LDR. So I don't think she's trying to make her boyfriend jealous.

Ok, I originally wanted to confess but I have doubts since I found out about her secret boyfriend.

Should I confess, or wait for her to make the first move?

I always feel an amazing spark everytime we're around (idk whether she feels it too or doesn't) but what I'm truly sure about is, we're always having fun whenever we are together, no matter what we do, time just flies.
Everyday feels like an adventure. One day, there's a national holiday so I gave her 2 weeks off. You know what happened? She only took 1 week and came back to work without my knowing, I asked her why and she said "" Staying in home was very boring and I wanted to surprise you.""

Oh, one more thing, we are asians. So please consider that sex is pretty much taboo here and how it affects the culture of how we show and display love in general (not as casual and straightforward as the western's)


Can't wait to hear your opinions, my fellow cyber friends"
I think the success rate is low

"Hello ESFJs! In this interview, I got a chance to talk to all the ExxJ types about their shared experiences and what makes them different from one another. During the interview, we talked about ExxJs having trouble making a decision for themselves and needing permission from the tribe before making decisions. We also talked about Te shaming Ti and Fe shaming Fi. Savannah asked an awesome question to the ESFJ and ENFJs on how Te's can be more sensitive to Ti's and not offend them. We also discussed what their Ti or Fi swing looks like when they go on a ""selfishness"" swing. We also discussed racist jokes and how they perceived it as an ExxJ. We also talked about blood and family ties and how the ESFJ and ENFJ perceived it differently from the ENTJ and ESTJ. Double observing was something we tried discussing but the topic was too boring for the ExxJs to continue talking about because it's so easy for them. In the end, the ExxJs had a message to say to fellow ExxJs on how to better themselves as individuals. Some things I noticed about each participant include Julia (ESFJ and our only info-dominant ExxJ) did an amazing job maintaining the flow of the conversation being balanced with her Si+Fe and Ne+Ti. Maggie (our jumper ESFJ) was relatively quiet and focused on gathering the tribe's perspective. Rob (our jumper ENFJ with double activated Ti and token male ExxJ) was acting very ExxP like with committing to decisions. Savannah (our jumper ENTJ) asked some very good questions to the lead Fe's. Nina (our jumper ESTJ and only lead NT) was doing a makeshift double decider which shows how present that masculine Fi is at the bottom when double activated. Natalie (our ENFJ and only MF) produced many hilarious moments including before the interview with her blast to Nina just seconds after learning something from Julia. And finally, Heather shows the big difference between an ESTJ and ENTJ when it comes to dealing with presenting themselves to the tribe. I also thought it was interesting that Julia being info-dominant was not as scared of how the tribe perceived her as the energy dominants were. Julia said she can clarify with the tribe which shows the easy flow of information while Natalie said she never thought of asking the tribe and just assumed everyone hated her. Watch this interview here:"
"I noticed there hadn't been a music thread for ESFJ's and I wanted to make one.  I'm not ESFJ, but I'm interested in your tastes as I have an ESFJ in my life.   So what do you guys listen to?"
"Hello ESFJs! PB/S(C) FF. In this interview, Maggie talked about being comfortable with gathering information from people and bugging people for help but having trouble with consuming new information for herself. Maggie also talked about wanting to be really competent as a result of her ST sleep and her identity is tied to competence. She said she wants to be a valuable and respected member of the tribe and being competent is how she perceives to be valued. We also talked about her being an ExxJ-ExxP and sometimes, she has no filter and just blurt things out without thinking which causes chaos in the tribe. Maggie also discussed her NF play and how she always tries to gather what the tribe really cares about. In her day job, she works as an economist and part of her job is to track what people care about so they can introduce programs that people will get behind it. In the last part of the interview, we talked about her Ti swing and she said that she's not surprised when it happens because it's built up over time and when she knows a person will not change their behaviour in a good way, she will set hard boundaries with that individual. Watch this interview here:"
"How the ESFJ uses valued Fe, Si, Ne, Ti, and unvalued ('shadow') Se, Fi, Te, and Ni.  Also includes my Jungian subfunctions system."
"Something I don't quite understand about ESFJs is that they derive their happiness from the approval of others. For example, I know an ESFJ who religiously tracks the number of ""likes"" they get on Facebook and Instagram. It seems that ESFJs are very kind and generous to others, but that stems from a desire to be well-liked, not necessarily from philosophically valuing kindness and generosity. To me (an INxJ), this sounds like a very insecure approach to life. 

How do more mature ESFJs work around this? Is there a better word than ""insecurity"" to describe this?

Can somebody clarify this for me or elaborate on this? Thank you!"
"Okay how are INFJ's attractive to ESFJ's? Or would INFP's be more attractive? why?
(esfj men and infj/infp women)"
"There are 4 matches for an INFP and I've changed my mind. I previously thought ENFJ was the best match for an INFP but now I believe it is ESFJ and let me tell you why...

ISFP and INFP are most compatible with ENFJ and ESFJ.

Briefly, each nickname is as follows:
ISFP: The Artist, the Aesthete, the Adventurer, The Artisan, the Dancer
INFP: The Child, The Daydreamer, The Quester, The Poet, The Idealist
ENFJ: The Teacher, The Coach, The Protagonist, The Guru, The Giver, the Mentor
ESFJ: The Nanny, The Consul, The Shadow, The Advice Giver, the Protector, the Provider, the Supporter, the Bodyguard

Here's what I'm thinking:
The INFP (Child) goes naturally with the ESFJ (Nanny) and the ISFP (Dancer) goes best with the ENFJ (Coach). Plus, the INFP and ESFJ share Si in common and the ENFJ and ISFP share Se in common so I think its better to have the senses of the past and present in harmony with each other.

Maybe you are an INFP and disagree and if so there are 4 other options...which is your favorite?
INFP or this one that says all 4 INFP-

a. ESFJ
b. ENFJ
c. ISTJ
d. INFJ"
"Hello ESFJs! In this panel interview, I got a chance to do a panel interview with personality types that all have introverted thinking, extroverted feeling, introverted sensing, and extroverted intuition in their function stack. Rose (ISFJ), Drew (ENTP), Isaac (ESFJ), Evelien (INTP jumper), and Viktoria (INTP), all shared how they personally experience their Si, Ne, Fe, and Ti. We started the interview with Si and Rose, Evelien, and Drew all think their Si function is boring. To Isaac and Viktoria, they like their Si because it gives them a sense of calm. Isaac said that your physical space reflects your mind and if you declutter your physical space then you are also decluttering your mind. Next, we jumped into the topic of Ne and gathering information. We talked about Fe and Ti at the end because those two functions were very interesting. During the interview, we discussed using Fe for good and using Fe for evil. Rose gave one of the best description of how masculine Fe works and how other people's negative emotions gets stuck on her and how she needs to use her Ti to reduce the damage to her mental health as a result of her Masculine Fe. Isaac and everyone else confirmed that with Feminine Fe, once they are not in the presence of a person suffering, that feeling doesn't linger. Drew mentioned that for him, Fe is more the suffering of groups instead of individuals. Finally, we got to Ti at the end and talked about everyone's identity. Some questions I asked them includes how Te shames Ti (in which Drew gave some very funny examples being married to someone that is lead Te). Isaac also gave a funny example of lead Te's using his idea and using it as just ""one"" idea as oppose to ""the"" idea to implement. I ended the interview by asking everyone about Fe gift giving since the stereotype of lead Fe is they like giving fruit baskets as a gift or a similar concept as presents to people. Watch this interview here:"
"Using a subfunctions system, I've tried to capture the main ways ESFJ uses Fe.  Please describe some others if I've missed any out."
"I am not really thinking about any real example. Just wondering, because it seems that Fe is a people function, but I mean by definition Fe is a function that make value judgment base on external/group standard, and it doesn't mean that you necessarily love people, in a general sense. You can also make all the decision and judgment in a Fe way and still not getting involved in the social because decision making is a personal thing. In this way you can totally be a quiet person keeping things to yourself.

An another thing is why does Fe always seems like a people function? And if that is true, is it possible to have quiet ESFJs/ ENFJs, and is there a time when you don't want to interact with people, when you don't think about people, don't talk about them, and just don't?

Additional question, how do you feel about your Ne and how do you use it?

Thanks!"
"I started an ESFJ blog if anyone is interested  Anyway, for real- such a dumb stereotype!

I think this is the stereotype that has bothered me the most, because I can’t see the truth in it in contrary of other stereotypes. I mean, SINCE WHEN DOES EXTROVERTED FEELING = EVIL BITCH???

I’ve seen ESFJ’s hate threads, I ain’t kidding. So many people (looking at you, INxx’s) tend to type the mean girls who picked up on you in school as ESFJ without thinking much while not considering he actual behvaior- is that really ESFJ, or just unhealthy? It seems like emotional, whiny, annoying bitches are typed as ESFJ while cold, angry and basically evil bitches are typed as ESTJ. However, I noticed that many times ESFJs really aren’t the mean girl- quite the contrary, they might even be nerds.

My first example is myself, an ESFJ. Let me say this- I was never bullied. But as a kid, I didn’t really liked anyone and I preferred to be alone. I was quite socially avoidant actually. As I grew up I opened up and now while I have many friends (both close and not so close) I wouldn’t classify myself as popular, while more well liked probably. Though let me tell you this- I don’t like going out to parties like ESFJs might do, I enjoy staying at home watching American Horror Story and Parks and Recreation. I like it when friends come over, I like it when they don’t I don’t depend on social interaction and definitely not on being mean and making sure my reputation still has Queen B written on it. I have another ESFJ friend who’s just like me, and all she does is watching Law & Order: SVU and meeting mainly with her boyfriend. She doesn’t care for social events or status one bit. But to tell you the truth on why I’m not a popular girl? Because my friends are the outcasts, the weirdos. Yep, me, an ESFJ, befriending the weird kids. I’ll tell you why- other than the fact they’re interesting as shit, all of my friends are pretty troubled. They have deep problems, while I don’t. And what I do? I help. ESFJs generally enjoy helping others and I’m an extreme mother hen to everyone around me. I enjoy helping them, fixing them, and if that means giving up status, so be it.

But if I’m not enough, let me provide you with some more examples:

Melanie Moretti from the show Hot In Cleveland (a show you probably don’t watch but you should if you want to see some non-stereotypical ESFJ’s, as Joy is definitely not a stereotypical ESFJ as well, but that’s for another post).










Anyway, Melanie is blatantly ESFJ. Leads with extrovert feeling, a care for the group and being kind and polite paried with introverted sensing which causes her to be detail oriented, freak out over the unknown and rely on her experience. If you’ve ever watched the show, you’d notice she constantly references her high school experience, which wasn’t very good. She suffered from all kind of physical diseases, was teased about it and was the subject of gossip among her peers, and when it was time for her prom what did she do? She stayed home with her mom and played Scrabbles. Not something you’d expect from an ESFJ, right? But you know, bullying happens to ESFJs too, not only INxx’s.

Anyone here remembers the show Victorious?










Tori was also an ESFJ. Definitely not a mean girl. Probably one of the nicest girls out there. Creative as well! A very good example of how an ESFJ in real life would look like, actually. On the other hand, who is the mean girl? Jade, interestingly an ISFP. Talking about ESFJ x ISFP pairs-










Come on, how can you say Leslie can be a mean girl? I’d say April, an ISFP, is a lot meaner. Not to be a bitch to ISFPs (they’re honestly my best friends), but I’m just making a point- ESFJs in general really isn’t a popular mean girl stereotype.

More examples are Mia Thermopolis from Princess Diaries (she’s had pretty much one friend during high school and was unpopular), Bernadette Rostenkowski from The Big Bang Theory (was probably more of a nerd rather than popular, especially when compared to Penny, an ESFP), Jenna from 13 Going On 30 (wasn’t that how the movie started?), and a lot more.

Of course, there’s always the Regina Georges and Gretchen Wieners’s, but what type doesn’t? Any MBTI type when unhealthy is a mean girl. Why is ESFJ any different?"
"You always hear about notorious criminals in other types but rarely often how they come or look when they are of types with a kinder image/stereotype..

I was just curious about your thoughts on Ghislaine, if you are familiar with her.

If not familiar, I was watching this when I looked it up. Apparently Jeffrey Epstein was an ESTP and Ghislaine, his partner in crime an was ESFJ. Both were 3w2."
"When an ESFJ goes ""in the grip"" from being overloaded at work, and becomes closed up and stops communicating with a best friend, do they still think about that friend with the same frequency? Do they miss that friend in the same way like they would have if they weren't stressed out? After they return back to normal, do they usually wish to resume the friendship just like it was before? Do they feel regret for distancing so much from that friend when they were stressed out?"
"Thank you for being here, ESFJs.

We don't thank you enough, but we should.

You're so bland, annoying, superficial, noisy, prone to please people instead of making selfish, cold, harsh, logical decisions or statements, you make the rest of us feel good about ourselves!

God bless Fe dom and inferior Ti

Please never leave this world..."
"hello esfjs.  I don't ordinarily hang out in your forum and I understand if some of you don't want to be interrogated by a curious ISTP.  however, if it would be of interest to any of you I am curious: have any of you mistyped as an INTP?  Have you ever read the descriptions of an INTP and thought ""Man that really sounds like me."""
Just wondering how @HAL and @Grandmaster Yoda are doing.
"Hi I'm an ENFP girl in my 20s and just had a first date with an ESFJ guy in his 30s.

We met on a dating app and have been talking for almost a month now.
He is a very busy guy and his texting style since the first has been the same, only twice a day (mornings & evenings) and if i got lucky it would be 3 times a day.
But whenever he replies, just like other ESFJs, he shows kindness, care, and being supportive.
Then he asked me to meet for a coffee.
We talked for about 1,5 hours before he had to go because of work and charity projects. When talking he seems like carefully using his expression like he's ""setting up"" his image. I could tell because I think he actually can be more expressive, you know.
He offered to drive me home and at the end he told me to say hi to my family for him.

I know that it's just one day since that happened. But during or after the date he hasn't mentioned about the probability of going to a second date. 
I texted him after date saying i had a great time and he replied kindly without any hints about our dates or how he feels about that.

Idk if I should just forget about it, or should I text him to ask about his intention.
Do you think he wants this to happen?

Sincerely,

Overthinking ENFP"
"Hello ESFJs! In this part 4 of the group interview with all types that have Extroverted Feeling, Introverted Thinking, Extroverted Intuition, and Introverted Sensing in their function stack, we discussed how each type use NT (Ne+Ti) Consume. Rose (ISFJ), Isaac (ESFJ), Julie (INTP), Emily (ENTP), and Andreas (INTP) talked about how they each individually use SF Blast. During this final part of this interview, Isaac talked about SF blast being a double-edged sword. Yes, you can get people to behave better and he talked about shushing people who weren't paying attention to the teacher when he was younger. At the same time, the SF part of SF blast made Isaac aware that it's not cool to be shushing people so he made sure to respect the SF part later on. Rose used to make rude chaotic t-shirts when she was younger which was very SF cool. Andreas does the whole rapping thing and he's also the biggest blaster in this group. Probably because he is saviour Di and is not as hesitant to blast even though Isaac and Rose have double-activated blast. Emily uses SF blast to troll people and Julie uses SF blast to be the ""controller"" in her family since her husband is even more chaotic than her. Watch this group interview here:"
