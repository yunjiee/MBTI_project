"Is it really that complicated? Has anyone had any experience, or opinion on it?"
"Finish the sentence! 

... you make lists of lists. haha =)"
"Hello,
Im curious what hobbies or interests you have. The reason is some of the description for ISTJ seems way off to me. I mean I like art and stuff. Hate accounting. 

OK. I have had weird hobbies.  
    I like wood working, made a few guitars/play guitar. Drawing, 3d modeling, animation, rock collecting/ lapidary,and I love camping but only if its waaaay out in the middle of nowhere.
   I dislike accounting and sports.
Does this contradict the basic ISTJ personality?"
"Finish the sentence.

I think it's a good idea to have an opposite of the ""You know you're an ISTJ"" thread, because I see a lot of stereotypes that a lot of us agree with, this thread should help prove our humanity. Maybe it will be stickied.

I don't know about you guys but I have tons of times when I doubt the fact that I'm an ISTJ, but then I have an ISTJ moment and all the doubts go away.

I doubt I'm an ISTJ when...

- I look at the disaster area I call my room. I have to clean it eventually, but my schedule is so tightly packed it will have to be on a Sunday between 11pm and Midnight.

- I start designing entire impossible worlds with their inhabitants for my writings, during college lectures.

- Class is separated into groups for group discussion and you and another person are doing all the talking because you're the only people in the group who've read the materiel.​"
"I made this for the Personality Cafe video challenge thread.

If you'd like to post a video of yourself for us to see, this is the thread.​"
"As per the title.

I think we've been getting too many variations of ""what do ISTJ's xXx when xXx"" and suchlike in the way of posts. With some luck people can be directed to one really, really long thread - read through it - and ask their question if it hasn't already been asked and answered.

Who knows, if this takes off it can maybe be stickied. <_<

Edit: Please try to keep it solidly on-topic, eh? Long-winded derails and suchlike will destroy any value. Take all potential derails to the Random thread, thanks!"
"I know stereotypicallisation isn't good but its fun, sometimes. So, lets get your thinking caps on, jog your memory for all stereotypical ISTJ's you have seen and even try a little intuition. 

I personally imagine an ISTJ to look very formal looking. Even in their casual clothes, they would be well- groomed and dressed. ISTJ girls, I imagine to have a massive purse/ handbag prepared for any challenges, has her hair tied in a ponytail/ bun/ hairclip. Office suits are suitable for both genders. Faded jeans with holes in it seems like a definite no go- zone. One who appears serious and even nerdish to a certain extent but lovable with animals. Boys will have adequate sized hair- not too long e.g.- not over the shoulders. Glasses could fit in nicely though are not necessary. Carrying a few books around for reading is also a probability. Oh yes, did I mention that if the shoes are black and leather made- then they would definitely be polished.

(Now, I am not sure if this has been addressed before and I hope it isn't. I also admit that I stole this idea from INTJ part of the forum but I am curious to hear of your replies. )"
"What pisses you off? Say it here. We could all use a thread for some venting.

As for me, people who sit on the bus, and blare their music loud piss me off! I hate it! People should have more respect!

I asked the young man to turn his music down, and he told me to 'Fuck off! I do what I want!"" I nearly laid him out. I'm shaking mad as I write this. =P

What pisses you off?"

"Pretty self- explanatory from the title. Explain the reasons behind your current mood and every time you change your mood as to why you have it. 

You can share private things if you want or you can keep it vague. Hope to keep this thread alive for a long while. This enables us to have a deep discussion about what's going on in our life.

"Okay, it's gonna be long... (Please read until the end I beg you, so you can understand the dynamic of our relationship)
I was in a relationship with an ISTJ male for about half a year now, he is a dermatologist in his early 30s , I am an INFP or ENFP (I seem to use Fi and Ne equally, can't really identify myself but I know for sure I use Fi+Ne+Si) i'm 24, he is my first ISTJ ever and to be honest I am quite new to this personality type as I've never engage or interact with one before 

We met on Instagram, I invited him to have a drink with me because I was interested, but he turned me down, he said he doesn't like drinking he can't be out late at night, and he doesn't know me that well. I didn't care much about it, I just brushed it off as ""him not interested"" but he kept the conversation going, some days he even sang me songs as voice recordings, he liked all my photos, watched my stories, so I guess he's interested? he always asked me how my day was, before I know it talking to him had become a routine, this had been going on for 20 more days
he never asked me out but I gave it another chance and invited him to have dinner at my place, surprisingly this time he decided to come.

The first meeting, (The Honey Phase) I cooked pasta and made some cocktails with my own recipes, it was 10 pm
he apologized in advance that he was going to be late, I didn't mind it because I understood he had a long day.
the first thing he said to me was that I looked better in person, so I just complimented him back for having a nice dimple but he quickly denied that it was not a dimple but a scar, he ate my pasta and told me I was great cook, he's not a drinker and yet he drank cocktail I made, We had red wine after but we struggled to open it, I had no wine opener but he tried every way to open it until we could drink haha, he never stay out late at night but there he was breaking his routine to see me, I was amazed at how much he was trying to impress me, everything just felt so right. by 12am we started to sing karaoke in my small room. didn't care about the neighbor, and when he put his arm wrapped around my neck, it felt a sense of security, and when he touched me I felt the gentleness upon his gaze, and when he kissed me on the lip it seemed as time had stopped at the moment and that is when I realized I've fallen in love, We had sex that night.I didn't want to do it much but he was touchy... I still had no idea whether he felt the same way, the next day he started giving me nickname ""My sweet chef"" I was taken by surprise, and then spontaneously he wanted to come and see me again, I had no idea what was going on that I asked ""What are we? Are we together?"" and just like that without any hesitation he said ""YES""

The Relationship
He helped me take care of my hair, my skin,gave me products, and drove all of the way to my office just to drop it for me. He gave me good advice, When I said I wanted to eat salmon, He bought it for me and we cleaned my kitchen together. He taught me to be more organized, and practical, taught me things I never knew and I taught him creative things back, we've always been supportive of each other, He helped me with money, I also learned that he has a skin disease psoriasis on his legs that's the reason why he can't drink beer, or be near people who smoke, I got protective each time someone smoked near him. I also helped him with his paperwork and he appreciated it so much.
He started to become more of himself yeah, at first I had a hard time understanding, but he explained to me he can't be who he isn't, I have to accept him as who he is, He got annoyed each time I asked a lot of questions, He mansplain me and always lectured me though being younger than him I don't mind learning from him through this, because i admit i'm not the most organized and neglect my health alot. he's very judgemental, robotic, he never expresses his emotion, and he never once say he ""Love me"" but his action said otherwise, I've never seen anyone so discipline, workaholic, and family oriented, very traditional, We only have time to meet once a week and yet he prefer his personal time over me, I didn't take it well, I had a hard time understanding why the need to be alone when you can be alone with me? we always fought about that, where is the time for me? we don't even see each other every day and when he has time, he spends it alone, went to cafes, or cinemas, sigh... I felt alienated from his way of thinking, someday I don't even know who he is, and someday he is the sweetest. but there's no spontaneity and everything needs a plan, he was so committed and disciplined to his goal. but we've come to terms with it that we are 2 very different individuals with different mindsets and personalities. there's no lies or pretenses, he's always brutally honest, he would say it even if it hurt my feelings but this gave me no trust issue at all, I trust him whatever he says.

The Breakup, on the week leading to it, we went to watch a movie together, it was Dracula The Last Voyage of the Demeter, we enjoyed the movie so much, during the movie he finally touched me again and gave me his hands it's been forever since he last touched me because of ""no public display of affection"". I saw that his psoriasis was spreading to one side of his eyebrow, I was scared for him, but he told me he got it under control, it spreads when under stress, ""Stress?"" I asked, why don't you tell me what's going on lately? he just said if he tells me nothing gonna change I can't help him anyway, when he faces with problems he shuts me out and needs to be alone in his personal space. this ofc pains me because knowing i'm alive and I can't do anything to help him. and then out of nowhere that same week, he told me doesn't want to be in a relationship anymore, I felt like my world was falling apart, and everything was crashing down, I pleaded with him to not make this decision now, but he said it's for the best, he said I am a good person, very vibrant , kind and caring something he's not and that I should find someone else that could love me better and could treat me better, he had alot on his plates right now, and he can't be afford to be in a relationship, he wants to be at peace with his mind and need his time... ofc so for him, I sacrificed this beautiful relationship just for his mental and well being, even if it's mean i have to ruined myself a million little times. 

Post Breakup, The next day I quitted my job on the spot, I was depressed, I had no motivation to do anything at all, I cried to sleep, it was killing me so hard, it was a sad october, I shut myself inside my home for almost 20days, that's how bad it was. but he texted me and ask ""is everything ok?"" it's like he telepathically knew what I was going through...or maybe he just felt the same, but I didn't go into details I just tell him i was fine, I just quit my job, I didn't tell him i'm having a hard time, I afraid he will think it's his fault, I did alot of reflect back and I realized that he loves me so much, just not the way I wanted, but in his own languanges , I've finally understand him more and more after researching about ISTJ, I also realized I forced my ideal onto him so much, I felt like I am the worst, I wish I had a time machine, and a couple of day later he texted me again, sharing news about the flood in my neighborhood, showing concern if i am okay or affected by the flood.. and I felt it in every pieces of my bones that he still love me. I'm not daydreaming or being delusional and I refuses to believe feeling changes overnight!, then kept our usual routine going, saying good morning or goodnight but with just more space and limit conversation and I just don't have the previlege anymore. he still update me on where he goes or who he's with, and I always trust him, sometimes I even forgot that we have broken up, but some days he's so cold toward me and when I tried to move on, he texted me again and when I don't reply he doubled text or even triple text and even try to wish me good luck on my business or my events.. I have no space to move on. if 2 person can't be apart then they are not meant to be apart, but he has made it clear that he wants to distance himself from me and want to focus on his peace of mind. he did alot of stuff to relieve his stresses, like watching cartoons or going to cafes, one day I got him to open up, he finally told me, his health is deterioating, his family pressure him get married, he is trying to pay his debts, while supporing his whole family. ""Please ask no more"" he said, I always told him i am here for him, then he said he afraid to be vulnerable and fragile in front of me so he has to be alone to solved his problem then shut me out again...I gave him his space and time because I finally got closure I wanted,and understand more of the situation now, and I felt like I will move mountain to be with him. a couple of day later he reached out to me again to ask how my day was.. this has going on for a month now, I still own his stuffs and he still own my stuffs, I still use his spotify account everyday, I asked if i am still allowed to? he said no problem i can still use it. his flight to myanmar is 20th november this month, and he's voicing concern about not having enough money for this trip, this trip is an opportunity for him to train and learn new knowledge. I just helped him and sent him some money, he thanks me and say he will pay me back as soon as possible, and i said it's ok settle your debt first, repetitively he kept saying ""you are a good person"" it's like he really wants me to find someone else better, but I don't want anyone else I want him. he told me we could meet again after his trip... 
so I need you all to help me construct a PLAN 
how to make him stop thinking that I can't accept him for who he is? if he wants to break up why bother keep me close and don't cut any contact? I want to write a letter to him about give our relationship another try? but how can I convince him to try again? he is so stubborn when he made up his mind but i believe i can reverse this. 
please help!"
"How do you know whether you're on the autism spectrum or just an ISTJ (or even just an introvert)? The traits are so similar sounding. Mainly the procedural, repetitive and very literal take on reading between the line situations. You can read more about autism traits here: https://www.autismspectrum.org.au/content/characteristics"
"Hi, ISFP here. I broke up with a friend because of my own insecurities about people liking me. I want to know how any of you ISTJs would feel if you were her and if you'd want to forgive/fix things. So some context, we were really close from the start but later on, something happened that made me question whether she really liked me, and I noticed that she never asked to hang out first just to chill/do nothing. Deep down, I knew she did care about me, but I'm really paranoid. I ended up trying to convince myself she hated me and that I was the only one who thought we were friends, and the other part of me knew I was being paranoid and tried to convince me otherwise. And I was scared of telling her because I thought she'd be annoyed if I kept asking for reassurance or if I seemed like I had mental issues. This led me to end up constantly thinking ""oh if I say/do one wrong thing, she's going to hate me."" And at the end of the year, she said something that made me realize that I'd been a bad friend and I just apologized too much over text, which was me cutting myself off because I thought I didn't deserve to be her friend. I might've overwhelmed her since she didn't reply even though it'd been 2 weeks. Then I decided to delete our messaging app for 2 months (I notified her about it and the duration I'd be gone before doing so). During the break, I realized alot of things, like how maybe she didn't actually hate me, and that people do actually like me for my real self and not because I'm useful. And I asked if she wanted to talk and work things out. But my friend told me that me shutting her out was like I didn't trust her and she wasn't interested in talking about what went wrong or mending our relationship atm. I've talked to her once after she texted this, and she seemed uninterested. She asked short, cordial questions but mostly just said ""ok"" to everything I said. 

I'm not doing anything to make her to forgive me, because I know I hurt her and broke her trust. But I really did trust her. Sometimes there are people in your life who you realize can't be replaced, because you won't be able to meet anyone else exactly like that person. For me, she was one of those people, so I want to fix things by talking/explaining. But is it the same for her? Is it a good idea? It seems like she's not interested in repairing the relationship.

I really think we could've stayed friends if we talked about what was going on. Thinking about it now, there were alot of things I should've told her but didn't because I was scared she'd hate me for being so attached. Like how much she always mattered to me, and the time when we had just met and I was too shy to ask to hang out, so I ended up going to events I thought she'd go to and waiting, hoping she'd show up, etc. The fact that I was afraid to say how much I cared about her seems so stupid now lol...

Alot of people have been telling me that I shouldn't try to chase someone who obviously doesn't like me as much as I do to her. I'm also not sure if it's just me used to being mistreated that I feel like it wasn't that bad, because the thing that matters to me is that she did care about me at some point. Idk what are your opinions?

I think I've changed after our friend breakup. Because I've only recently realized that real friends don't hate you unless you do something to hurt them. And I realize that people like you more if you're just yourself, and you don't need to do stuff for people to like you. And it's been easier for me to be myself and stop overthinking and filtering my words whenever I speak. I've also been talking to strangers alot and getting meals with random people on campus. I try not to cut off people as possible friends before getting to know them more first, and my social network is larger now. I'm more brighter and sociable than I was before, and I'm surprised by how easy it was to change so much. But I regret that it cost me a friend I really cared about. During the 2 months of no contact, I just kept thinking that I was such a horrible friend and if I could only hurt the people I cared about, I was better off gone. The experience really did cripple me, but I guess you can only change this much if you get hurt badly enough to want to."
"ISTP here trying to understand Si, so I thought I’d ask the Si doms directly.  How do you experience your Si?  I thought I’d share my experience with Ti to help, my Ti just comes to me, if I’m looking at the problem by observing or “tinkering” the observation is working out the problem logically in the background, unbeknownst even to me.  Then all of a sudden I get a idea, an answer out of no where.  Sometimes one answer, sometimes many, then consciously I pick which answer is the most likely to work and try that.  If it doesn’t work, through trying that idea I’ve pulled in more information so I get more accurate ideas and try those till something works.  But Ti feels truly like a light bulb someone just flipped on.
So how do you experience your Fi?"
have you istjs ever noticed that the aspects of your personality type that appear in memes are the same as in enfp memes? how can this be possible if the two types are opposites?
"I as an Enfp would like to know what you all think of every typological type
I encourage you to be as specific as you wish(using type combos or other particularalities, etc.)"
"I have a ISTJ ( Scorpio) guy friend.
He got a gf this past October. It’ll be 1 year this Oct. We had a past together, and it was intimate. We remained friends as he wanted to- even when they started to date. I told him I wouldn’t interfere and he said I wouldn’t, and she is welcoming of friends and to keep them.

We don’t talk now? It’s been a month and he has ignored all my texts. I’ve apologized, and kept my texts friendly, so I’m not sure what happened"
"Hello everyone,

I turned 28 at the beginning of the month and it has been something like 3 years since I got my master degree and started to work on myself (lost 30 kilos, started going to gym,eating healthy, etc.).
I've recently got an RedHat IT certification and started to work on the second level as it would really allow me to get a better job/income.
But I don't know, I feel kinda lost those days. Like, maybe I'm tired of working in addition of my job and my routine which is : wake up > breakfast > job > gym > eat > home work > sleep (I still take some days where I watch some animes or play a little video game from time to time if I really don't want to work)
Maybe I feel sort of burnt out and I have to admit that I don't meet many people outside of my habitual friends, which are great and I like having fun times with them but I can't really talk computer things with them for example.
I should be happy that I passed my certification but I still feel somehow empty. It's true that I haven't got a deep conversation with someone for a long time and living in country side in a small village doesn't really help if I'm honest. I don't really know if it's the cause or the consequence but I often feel like an alien an have low energy.

Does it happen to you that sometimes, for whatever reason, you feel somehow hollow and empty while you already have many things (salary, car, investments, etc.) ?

I think I already know the answer which is to continue to fight and maybe try new things but I would like some outlook from others than my habitual social circle."
"Despite what the vile Televangelist Preachers say, America is not, and was never meant to be a Christian Nation.  No, for after all, the Founders were Deists, if anything.  Moreover, it is precisely a couple of Nations, whom Americans hate and dread above all others, over in Europe, namely Russia and Germany (dare I make mention of either) which really were founded on the Christian religion.  You see, that is precisely why they have, historically, been more than a bit anti-Jewish.

From Deism, of course, comes the conception of The Separation of Church and State.  And, from the Separation of Church and State comes the idea of the Citizenship Clause of the 14th Amendment of the US Constitution.  That is, the idea that any born within the borders of The United States of America is a US Citizen, with all the rights of one.  Indeed, the 14th Amendment, could be termed The Separation of NATION and State.

Of course, having said that, I may as well say that I consider myself to be a Deist.  After all, Christianity is more than a bit anti-Jewish for my taste.  And, that is especially true of Roman Catholic Christianity, with its Replacement Theology.  And any who have read the history of Europe, in any depth, realizes that Adolf Hitler, Heinrich Himmler, and most of the other top Nazi officials were born into the Roman Catholic faith.  Mind you, the Founders were wise for coming up with The Separation of Church and State.  For they knew that they, as Deists, would always be a minority.  And, it was one way of keeping the Christians from persecuting Muslims and Jews; while at the same time not harming Christians too much, lest Christians accuse us of persecuting them."
"Well, there's a song 'about' you people now. Questionable accuracy."
"Never thought about ISTJs before. But those types can really complement each other. Still Im not sure... So far I only ended up with other N types, but their Si-Te is my weakspot and it could really improve my life. But when I think about ISTJ women, it somehow also feels cold. But maybe Im taking the MBTI too far.

Basically they are a reversed INFP. So, maybe it is more familiar, than I think. What do you think?

Also I would like to know, how female ISTJs think about male INFJs. We are basically the opposite of the traditional gender roles. Which I like. But how do female ISTJs see it?"
Any ISTJs who are often sick?
"I very specifically would love to hear from an ISTJ dad with an INTP son but I will take any combo of ISTJ parent to INTP kid. My husband is an ISTJ and my almost 13 year old son is an INTP. I thought ENTP/ISTJ was a hard combo to relate but I am learning INTP/ISTJ is worse. Their brains operate in almost completely opposite ways and neither seem to be able to figure the other one out. 

From my view, the biggest issues of relating are the following:

-ISTJs tend to be task masters and assume anyone not completing tasks (they think is useful) is not doing anything that is important while INTPs can spend hours daydreaming/thinking (I am told it actually is what recharges them).

-ISTJs tend to react well to being given a well laid out task list and can be motivated by guilt/loyalty/obligation to complete them while the more you push an INTP, the more they dig their heels, hate being managed and do better if they are given an end goal and left alone with a deadline to complete it, and are rarely motivated by guilt or obligation.

-ISTJs tend to assume that tasks and what needs to be done is obvious to others and that there is only one or two logical ways to do things while an INTP sees endless ways to do things (some more efficient than others) and rarely even notices some of the open ended tasks.

-ISTJs tend to not say much when things are running smoothly or things are being done correctly, but will be the first to comment when someone is doing something they deem ""wrong"" and they tend to be motivated to fix things if there is criticism for their work. To an INTP, they respond better to positive reinforcement and tend to take criticism hard, even if it was not meant maliciously, and tend to shut down and give up rather than fix it.

Anyway, my husband and my son just don't get each other and I think it really needs to be addressed as he is hitting middle school/high school. My husband is not sure how to get him to understand he is not being ""mean"" but it's at the point where the damage is done. I was wondering if anyone has any sage advise that worked for them in relating to their kids."
"ENTP's and ISTJ's tend to be considered rival types and having not met many I was just wondering what exactly are the different traits that fuel our rivalry, I get that we're mostly opposites but what exactly are the worst things ENTP's do that piss you off?"
"So I continue to chug away at dating. I go on dates and none of them end up badly with her storming off or tossing a drink at me but I just constantly get the no chemistry not feeling it.

The thing is I never feel this instant lightning bolt/spark type reaction. It is more like I am attracted which isn't a big thing. I am attracted to about 85% of women in my age/race bracket. As I get to know them as a person it builds more and more and I start getting a picture of building a life together.

How was it when you fell in love? Was it like an instant spark?"
"I am placing these list from Susan Storm’s website. You should not use this list in an attempt to determine your type. Instead the list is being placed here for discussion among ISTJ types or compare list with other types that you may want to compare and contrast.

1. You Use Your Past As a Guide for the Future

As you go through life, you consider it your moral obligation to learn from each experience, whether it’s a failure or a success. You collect these experiences and recall them when a crisis hits or a solution is needed to a problem. That said, if you’re in an unhealthy phase of life, you might get hooked on bad habits from your past – enjoying the comfort or thrill of these habits and wanting to relive them even if they have negative consequences.

2.  You Remember the Facts and Details of Past Experiences Well

You have a gift for remembering little details and experiences from the past. Because of this, you quickly notice changes and shifts. For example, if you walk into a room, you might be the first to notice that the furniture has been rearranged. You also might notice if someone’s body language differs from their typical composure and sense that something isn’t right.

3.  You Crave a Sense of Routine

Unpredictable situations are anathema to you, so you try to have a clear direction for your day. Usually you have a calendar planned out and a daily flow that helps you to know what to expect and when. This sense of routine and consistency puts you at ease and gives you the freedom to think clearly.

4.  You Enjoy Reliving Your Favorite Memories

All types enjoy reminiscing from time to time, but you seem to have a special affinity for it. You can close your eyes and recall a past memory and feel as if you are really living and breathing it. The past comes to life in vivid detail and lush imagery. You can even enter a state of flow through this process. Find out more things you enjoy in 10 Things That Excite the ISTJ Personality Type.

5.  Following Through On Your Word is a Huge Priority for You

Because being consistent and dependable is so crucial to you, people know that they can depend on you to mean what you say and do what you say you’ll do. Letting someone down or forgetting a responsibility makes you feel intense shame and frustration.

6.  You Experience Déjà vu A Lot

Because your memory for details and experiences is so remarkable, you quickly make connections between what is happening now and what happened in the past. Small similar experiences or sights can give you a sudden, unexpected feeling of déjà vu. People of your type frequently mention having this sensation on a regular basis.

7.  You Post-Process Experiences to Enjoy Them Fully
When you’re experiencing something new you tend to feel a little detached from it – as if experiencing the full weight of the present moment would be overwhelming. However, after the experience is over you often replay it in your mind – enjoying the beauty of it more after the fact than during. Which leads to our next point…

8.  You Beat Yourself Up Over Past Mistakes

Because you’re always trying to learn from your mistakes and you have a tendency to post-process experiences, you have a tendency to re-play embarrassing or awkward moments in your head. You might lie in bed at night beating yourself up over mistakes you made 10 or 20 years ago, feeling as if the shame and frustration of it all is happening in the present.

9.  You Try to Have a Calm, Composed Manner

Loud, brash, over-reactive people tend to annoy you. You respect people who can maintain a sense of composure and control, even in trials and tribulations. You try to maintain an air of professionalism and coolness in any situation that presents itself.

10.  You Quickly Sense Changes in Patterns

Because you’re so aware of details, facts, and past experiences, you quickly notice unexpected changes or shifts in behavior. This makes you keenly attuned to changes in patterns or inconsistencies in people.

11.  You Get a Strong Sense of Satisfaction From Crossing Items Off Your To-Do List

Productively-minded, you get a thrill from crossing items off a task-list. You get a surge of joy from knowing your projects are being completed and you don’t have to worry about them anymore.

12.  Competence Is Crucial to You

Being competent and being surrounded by competent people is vital to your well-being. Finishing tasks on time, being logical, and responding with a cool-headed manner to any crisis gives you a sense of well-being and confidence. This can make you a highly respected leader (check out the ISTJ Leader to see more about this).

13.  Fairness and Justice Are Core Values of Yours

You hate preferential treatment and believe that solid rules and regulations should be applied to all people without bias. That said, you believe clarifying the rules and making sure they are just, fair, and reasonable is crucial. You will fight relentlessly to tear down rules you see as oppressive or unjust.

14.  You’re Skeptical of Overt Displays of Emotion

When people are emotionally reactive, cloying, or effusive, you tend to get suspicious. What do they want? Are they emotionally okay? Can you trust them? Why is their eye twitching? Why are they crying? Why can’t they calm down?

15.  You’re a Realist More Than an Idealist

You have core values that you strive to uphold no matter the odds. But even with that in mind, you consider yourself a realist more than a dreamer. You want to know the facts and avoid having your mind clouded by theories and emotions that might cloud your ability to see the reality of a situation clearly.

16.  “Be Prepared!” Is Your Motto

You create plans and contingency plans for the future so that no matter what happens you will have a solution readily available. People count on you for your ability to organize and present alternative plans when a disaster occurs. That said, if a situation comes up that you’re unprepared for, you tend to feel trapped and overwhelmed. You need to get away to a quiet place so that you can devise a solution.

17.  You’re Skilled in the Art of Logistics

You seem to innately know how to organize people and objects in the most efficient way. Getting things done on time, getting people where they need to be, and handling many moving pieces is something you have the capability to do with nearly unmatched skill.

18.  You Have Perseverance

If you put your energy into something, you see no virtue in bowing out before you’ve given 100% of your energy to it. You put a tremendous amount of willpower into every action you take.

19.  When You’re Stressed, You See Dozens of Negative Possibilities

Normally focused and grounded, when you’re severely stressed you tend to flip a switch and become filled with visions of doom and gloom. You see all the ways that your plans could unravel and all the potential security risks that lie ahead of you.

20.  You Despise Pretention

People who craft elaborate phrases with superfluous words tend to get on your nerves. People who try to appear like philosophers, gurus, or “experts” without the life experience to back it up make your skin crawl.

21.  You Put Facts Before Personal Feelings

You’ve made it a top priority to place truth on a higher level of respect than emotions. Your heart or feelings might be swaying you one way, but you know the facts are pointing in another direction. Except in really crucial situations, you’ll follow the facts over the feelings in a situation.

22.  You Hate the Idea of Compromising Your Values

What few people know except those closest to you is that you have a deep set of unchangeable values. You know what you believe to be right and wrong and you won’t compromise that for anything. You strive to stay true to your sense of integrity regardless of what the crowd is doing or what is popular at the moment.

23.  Change Makes You Anxious

You prioritize a carefully crafted routine that you can count on no matter what life throws at you. You crave the familiar, the quiet, and the sense of continuity that comes from having a set schedule. Unexpected changes make you nervous and rattled.

24. You Hate Clashing Sensory Details

Being in bright, chaotic environments or being around people who are wearing clashing patterns can make you feel uneasy and queasy. You like the things around you to be organized, calm, and aesthetically pleasing. When the details around you clash, you have an insatiable urge to “fix” them. This can make you seem a little obsessive and nitpicky to people who don’t share your tendencies."
"So I am a 41M ISTJ Chemist. I fit most of the textbook descriptions of an ISTJ except I am not as organized and detail oriented as I would like to be, not really as stubborn, in romance I really need to warm up to someone first though some of the descriptions read like ""by the 10th date I finally made a move and touched her hand hopefully kiss by the 20th"".

I am primarily relying on OLD. I don't go to many places where I meet women in real life. I a pursuing women my age 35-50 without kids (don't have don't want). My dating history is nearly nonexistent. I am not particularly sensitive to women's attractiveness and most women are sufficiently attractive to me. It isn't my primary criteria.

I think a biggest problem I am encountering is I just don't know how to tease, banter, and flirt. I have conversations ask questions, listen but in the end I often get told no chemistry. My default state is kind of Mr. Spock.

Any tips? 

I have watched a lot of Youtube videos and am envious of the natural charm those guys are able to exhibit but don't feel I can do it effectively and genuinely.."
"***I'm putting this in the ENFP, INTJ, and ISTJ forums to see what types of advice I can get. I appreciate anything you have to say!!!****

Ok, help me please! I am an ENFP and my dad is IXTJ (unsure between S or N still, he says he tests either way). I am about ready to have a breakdown over the relationship between my father and I. It seems like we can rarely spend more than an hour or two alone before we are bickering about something, and sometimes he just throws these awful tantrums if I don't do something his way.

Now, everybody knows the biggest issue between our two types is 1)housework and 2)control. My dad loves control. He's been divorced twice (my parents divorced when I was 19). He has me terrified to actually move out because he says if I don't follow his schedule I will end up homeless and working at Burger King the rest of my life. I am almost a senior in college (live at home, attend school online) and I don't feel like I'm ready to face the world at all. 

All I hear about is how I do things wrong. Luckily I've been in therapy for the last two years so I'm working on these issues alone, but his constant yelling just still brings me down. He is even controlling my therapy! Luckily I'm about done with my program, but he said after this year no more. If I get sick and go to the doctor, all he talks about is how much money I'm costing him. He pays for all my expenses, which I am truly grateful for (REALLY I AM!), but I just feel like there's an emotionally draining price to pay. 

The housework issue is just god awful. I've gotten better about keeping most of the house clean, but with my bedroom/bathroom I really don't care. It is nothing against him whatsoever, but for me to clean is just not my nature. I don't think about putting something away after I've used it. I toss my clothes on the floor. My junk litters the bathroom counter. Keep in mind, we do not share a bathroom. So, unpredictable him says nothing half the time, and the other half he has these temper tantrums. He screams at me and orders to listen to his barking. He says if I don't clean or do xyz, he'll throw away my stuff. If I go into my room and lock my door, he screams loud and threatens me. He thinks everything I do (or don't do) is to piss him off. He thinks I don't clean my room to purposely piss him off. I just don't think about it!

I also feels like he values his 'stuff' more than me. If I break something or something gets messed up in the house and I can't provide a logical explanation of how it exactly happened, I get yelled at. For example, the sprayer on the sink got stuck one morning while I was making coffee. While trying to unstick it, it popped off. No big deal. I immediately called him and let him know so he wouldn't come home to a broken sink. He says it's fine. That night, he gets on my case about how it 'really' broke. He said he was sick of my friends messing around with his shit and breaking everything. Um, I was the one who caused it to pop off. I am not aware of doing anything unusual to the sprayer. 

Or this one is even better (more hilarious, sad, whatever you choose). So my boyfriend comes over one morning and we were planning on cooking a huge breakfast. So he helps me make the omelets and we have a good time. We didn't break my dad's stuff, we cleaned it, put it away when we were done. That night dad starts yelling at me about how my boyfriend 'scratched' his pan (it was a tiny little scratch). Well, it happens, plus it's an item you COOK with. You expect it not to get scratched? Is it me, or does it seem unrealistic? Then he yells about how we didn't clean the kitchen enough. Nothing is ever good enough for him, and his stuff means more to him than me.

I suppose another issue is finances. I've been struggling ever since a manic episode caused by a medication last summer, when I blew my savings account. Now he lent me the money to pay for the debt, and I paid him back in full. But I was still having trouble saving my money. I finally just saved enough money to pay off all my own department store credit cards (it was quite a bit) and I just tossed them in the trash (last week, actually!). So now my savings is scant. He asks today, I tell him, and he freaks out. He's saying I can't control my money and now wants to control my account. I am 22! I don't want him touching my own money because I'm going to be out of the house soon enough. He says if I don't show him my account, I have to move out by the end of December.

That's another thing (lol, long rant, can't you tell we just had a fight?). He's always threatening to kick me out. If I don't pick the clothes off my floor, MOVE OUT! If I don't put the dishes away immediately, GET THE #%^& OUT! He's said that a million times in the last few years, and obviously I'm still home. Go figure.
His control is just maddening. I can totally understand why mom divorced him. His girlfriend is pleasant but similar in behavior (to her own son, actually). I want nothing to do with them for the most part.
He spends most of the time (including nights) at his girlfriend's so I really don't have to deal with this anymore. But on the inside, I still feel like I'm 17. I know I am plenty capable of getting my ass out of the house, yet it seems like he has this mental leash on me. What can I do to make him less.... jerk-like without completely complying to his every demand?

I have made a lot of changes in the last year. A year ago, I was drinking heavily, having sex too willingly, partying. Basically, extremely reckless. I've cleaned up entirely now. I have not had a drop of alcohol in over six months, I am getting mostly A's in my bachelor's program (3.6 GPA), I attend church on a regular basis and am active in the congregation, I'm working on becoming a leader in a Christian recovery program, I write a blog, I have a great part time job, I take voice lessons in return for babysitting, I have not had sex in a long time, etc... I do not think I am still acting like a child. My frustration might seem childish (it probably is), but I have made a lot of progress without my dad's help. His behavior is still the same.

Is it hopeless to think our relationship with ever be ok? I love him to death and he shows his love by showering me with extreme generosity. But I just feel like things are destroyed and I can't salvage a good relationship with him. What can I do that's reasonable (for both him and me) that helps our bond grow? Btw, I live with him at home, and it's just the two of us."
"Dear brethren ISTJs, I am hopelessly crushing on a friend of a friend. I’m 49 and a widow, but I feel like a teenager right now. So far, I’ve only been around him three times, in the context of a social gathering that the mutual friend arranges. Without Cutie there, I’m bubbly and assertive and relaxed with the others. He shows up, and I get awkward and silent and stare at my shoes. Typical ISTJ reaction. He’s very nice to everyone, including me, and I’m just sitting there tongue-tied and staring at the freckles on his arms, mentally recording what he says and the shape of his eyebrows and the color of his shoe laces, to journal in detail when I get home. Yes, I even walked up to his truck in the dark parking lot, to see what his birth month was on the license plate (May).

This past weekend, two of the gang (ENFJ and ESFJ) both asked with concern whether I was feeling all right or something bad had happened to me, because I was sitting there like a lump, not smiling, silent, and looking down at the floor. Well, ESFJ had taken my seat when I went to the bathroom so that she could talk to the person next to me, and so when I got back, I had to take her seat, which was directly in front of Cutie! I was paralyzed. Him: “What city in [country of childhood] did you grow up in?” Me: “Um, uh…”

To add a layer of complexity, I’ve typed him as ISTP, so he has that easygoing physicality that ISTPs have, a very physical presence without doing or saying anything. I feel overwhelmed by both my feelings for him and by his physical presence.

Bottom line: If you’ve had a relationship with someone you first crushed on, how did you get over the overwhelm and social paralysis? He’s single and in an appropriate age group for me, and I’m not in a hurry, but I would like to get to know him better, SLOWLY LIKE AN ISTJ OR A TORTOISE, which would be impossible if I’m a petrified statue every time he’s in the room. This did not come up when I met my late husband, because I did not have a crush on him and we were friends first without me suspecting that I’d develop feelings for him later. Will I ever feel comfortable around this guy? Does an ISTJ crush ever morph into a relationship? How did you get over the paralysis?"
"I’ve been in sexual relationship with a guy since 2008. I think he’s still attracted to me because he opens my pictures quite a few times when I send him. About 9 months ago, he told me he’s back together with his ex, and I don’t know if it’s his ex wife or girlfriend, and I still don’t know if they are together as this is long distance. I bought a plane ticket to see him next week because it seemed apparent he was with someone when he was with me and is pretty open/flexible. I’m at loss about what to do

It’s hard for me to want to be in a relationship with anyone because I’ve seen too much cheating in my life. However, it’s been a year since I’ve seen him, and there’s this void. I miss going over there and I have all this lingerie I haven’t worn and don’t want to throw away. I don’t ever think I can find anyone who will do it for me like he did or has made me feel so wanted before.

(I’ve only had one friend and she lives out of state). 

I wanted to ask an ISTJ this because I am an ISTJ, and there were characters in movies I could really relate to when they were dealing with grief. Before I discovered my type, I could relate to a lot of characters in movies that I found out were ISTJ. 

I wanted to ask an ISTJ this because I am an ISTJ. Before I learned type, I identified with many characters in movies deal with grief in the same way as I do, and they seem to be typed as ISTJ.


The older guy in Up who continues to sit on his chair because he can’t get over the death of his wife.
The king at the end of Lord of the Rings Return of the King who sits there and feasts on tomatoes because he doesn’t know how to move past the loss of his son and impending destruction of the kingdom
The captain of the Titanic who literally can’t function after they hit the iceberg. (My ability to use Te has gone out the window).
The guy who hides the family in the Quiet Place who still continues to look at photos of his wife and internalizes everything

Basically, I could relate to a lot of these characters before I knew type. 

I don’t think I can ever move on. There’s just too many memories, but I don’t like feeling like this. It’s been so hard and I’ll randomly start crying in front of people, and I can’t focus. (I’ve spent over 2 hours trying to draft this). I don’t care about money, can’t remember anything and couldn’t function and had to leave work because I can’t guide myself through. 

 I don’t want it to be like those movie examples. Anyone been in a situation where they were able to deal with a loss effectively? I only have one close friend, and she’s out of state, and I haven’t been talking to her much because this has been on my mind too much."
"All the types have such unique perspectives in our world.  I'm curious about how the different types tend to experience travel.  So I'm asking all you ISTJs:

Do you like traveling?  Why or why not?  If so, how much/how important is it to you (is it something you enjoy or something you make a point of getting as much as you can in)?

What sorts of things stick with you from traveling?  Certain people you met, the experience of being in a new culture on the whole, particular places, the art, the natural landscapes, etc.?

If you like traveling, what about it attracts you?  Do you tend to gravitate towards what aspects of travel?  Do you like it as a thrilling adventure or as a way to relax?  Are you drawn to places where you can experience more culture or more settings/landscapes?

Lots of questions, answer whatever you'd like, and anything else you think of"
"Hello fellow ISTJ females, please help this guy in distress.

I've been dating this ISTJ girl for the past 6 months. At the beginning it was great, she wasn't the most ""exciting"" women in bed but there was a deep connection and that mattered more than anything else. We had sex pretty often, basically every time we saw each other. 
Now things changed a lot, even though we spend the entire weekend together, nothing happens between us. When we go to bed together, she just falls asleep cuddled with me... This has been eating my heart alive, even though she is just right there besides me, I feel a great distance between and makes me feel unwanted. It's horrible, I'm not even seeking sex, just some sort of intimate connection..
I've raised her attention to it, I've been very comprehensive, I told her that I have needs and feelings too. She basically gets on her nerves very quickly and tells me she is not in the mood for it and in should respect that. I tried explaining her, like many things in life, even though we are tired or not in the mood, sometimes when we start we end up getting into the mood and enjoying it. She didn't seem to understand at all and went south with the argument so I dropped it.

Fellow ISTJ ladies, how do you approach intimacy? Should I expect this to be just a phase? I'm afraid this is not something I'll be able to tolerate in a regular basis."
"Hypothetically speaking- if you had to choose 
Would you rather lose all the memories(verbal/kinetic /emotional etc ) that you have now but you’re able to create new ones for the rest of your life or to keep all the memories that you have created but unable to create new ones after a 24 hours time span?

"Hello 

I recently got a book from our library about analyzing handwriting, and wanted to share a description I found accurate for myself.

""A special situation called secondary expansion is where the letters themselves are narrow but the spaces in between them are wide. On the surface the writer appears to be outgoing, but inside she shrinks away from social contact. Yet despite her insecurity and shyness, she pushes herself to interact, at least in groups where she knows the people. We call this type of person a ""converted introvert"" because while it isn't natural to her, she's learned how to behave as an extrovert in social situations."" -The Complete Idiot's Guide To Handwriting Analysis, Second Edition- Sheila Lowe


I find this extremely interesting because that description is pretty close to the way I behave in school, and matches my handwriting style almost perfectly.

If you don't mind, a description of your handwriting and type would be pretty sweet to see if handwriting analysis is basically accurate. Thank you!"
"1. Hate history
2. Don't understand the laws

it's really interesting how many such atypical representatives are here"
"I've read thru many of your threads, including the stickies, and have learned a lot. But one thing I can't understand is, if an ISTJ man is clearly into you, why is he so passive as far as pursuit goes? 
My ISTJ lives 1.5 hours away and owns a few successful businesses, therefore, he is very busy. However, when I ask to see him, he will drive out to my place or vice versa, no problem. He consistently initiates texts with me on a daily basis, has told me he sees a future with me, I check all his boxes, and he wants to build a home/family with me --- but he never ASKS to see me or plans a date. It's like....there's no URGENCY on his part. It drives me crazy and absolutely baffles me. As an INFJ, I usually end up with aggressive and passionate men who go from 0-60 right away and pursue me with gusto.  So....this whole slower than a snail with a broken leg thing is really hard for me to understand. 
Conversation with him is easy, but I am leery as to how to approach this with him. I know I need to be direct, but I also have read that PATIENCE is the key. 
So....my question is - do ISTJ men prefer to be pursued by the women they're interested in? And if so, what's the best way to do this without overwhelming or pressuring him? If he's NOT actively asking ME out, should I assume he's NOT interested? Very confusing. If you could shed some light....I would greatly appreciated. 
FWIW, we're in our 40s and have been dating 9 months with a break in between due to communication issues, which we are resolving very well now. We are exclusive but not ""committed"". (He says ""relationships take time to develop - commitment is a huge step."")"
"Out of these types series, which do you prefer and why?
If other, state what that might be."
"My bestie is ISTJ-T, I'm INFP-T and one of her closest friend is INFP-A. Is it weird that INFPs are close to ISTJs? What can attract us?

We are childhood friend, my first one (We were already together in kindergarten, and when I went away for health issues she was really sad and had difficulties with other children...she said it to me). I feel her as a cute, strong, clever, stubborn, kind and perfectionist girl, the one I can always trust. I asked her what she thinks about me and she only said ""You are you, you should know who you are"". She doesn’t give many explanations, she opens while talking and not asking. But she cares, I see with actions.

So, I was curious about what can help a friendship between an INFP and an ISTJ. Do you have INFPs friends?"
"Hello ISTJs!!  I was hoping some of you could give me some advice. I am an ENFJ who after having broken up with a controlling and boundary pushing ex two months previous I went on a blind date (my first!) with an ISTJ (who has had very bad luck dating) through a mutual friend.
At first I found him a bit robotic and very shy, he wouldn't take the lead on many conversations, regardless I asked him out on a second date at which point I said ""I feel a spark, but I don't think it's all the way there, sorry!"" but in hindsight I was searching for the wrong traits. 
Fast forward a few months and we've stayed in contact and the more I get to know him the more we get on really well, I had always valued his sense of duty, reliability, good work ethic and honesty and now he was coming out of his shell I liked him more and more. 
We decided to meet up again last week and had a lovely time out and then went back to mine to watch some films. He then started making a move on me, we don't have sex but done everything in between - which I was not expecting! I wanted to tell him how I felt but thought it best to let things sink in and tell him next time I see him which would of been later this week. 

During the weekend though he texts me saying 'I've been thinking about the other night, I don't think it should happen again and we should stay friendly. Sorry i'm not in the right frame of mind'. I explained to him that that's okay and I'm here if he wants to go into specifics and talk about things, I told him i was going to tell him later on in the week that I did see us more than friends and that at first I couldn't make sense of my feelings but I have now and I think we are compatible and that I jumped the gun a bit on our second date. 
He said 'that's okay I just need time to sort myself out before making any decisions'.  He's very very stressed from work, sleep deprived and I know things have been vague between us which I know ISTJs don't like but I was wishing to clarify those feelings soon. 

I don't know how to interpret those messages, should I push for specifics so I can perhaps help him with what's going on or let him have his space? We are still talking to each other but at a far slower pace.  
I still want to make this work but I feel like I may have missed the chance, I feel like we still need to have a proper conversation about what's going on, and I want to reconfirm my feelings for him properly but I don't know when's best to do that, and as a call, a voice note, a text? He's too shy to ever bring anything up like this to me, I usually have to make the first move.   

Any ISTJ perspectives would be greatly appreciated on how to navigate the situation! thank you 🥰"
"Any ISTJ's one got a story to tell about a situation that you experienced and either regretted or are proud of that might even changed you for the better or worse.

I hope this story isn't violating TOS of PC because of drug reference.

the following occurred about 7 years ago.

For me I feel proud of a situation and maybe a little regret where I went with some friends (~5) to play disc-golf since they asked me. We played some then they'd gather in a secluded area and sat around and then they started to light up a bong! :shocked: I didn't know what to do so I just stayed with them and kindly rejected a puff or what ever you do with it because I didn't want to touch something like that. A few even told me something like 'Class good for you' or 'I wish I could be like you' :kitteh:roud:. After finishing our game and left I didn't know if I should have called the Police or told one of the teachers/guidance concealer which I didn't do anything because I didn't know what would have happened to me, our friendship or what not. I figured out that day what '420' was!

I usually tell people the same thing about cigarettes/alcohol that I don't smoke or have any and I usually get the same response once in a while that they wish they could be like me or are proud that I don't."
"Hi guys, I have been in a friends with benefits situation with an ISTJ, whom I have liked since January. We never ended up dating because back in Jan, he said we have different beliefs when is comes to marriage and kids. He didn't see himself committed where else I do. We are both 28, so we kept it casual (I has also just come out of a 10 year abusive relationship), it was finally refreshing to be with someone that I can get along and feel like home with. I am INFP, I feel a lot, he doesn't have to say much but I do understand his emotions. It's like we communicate through our eyes not words. He does know how I feel about him, because in Feb I confessed about my feelings and then since we decided to not date, I went my separate ways.

A month later he messaged me asking how I was, and we started talking again. I also realised I wasn't ready for a relationship back in Jan/Feb and I was still healing from my past relationship. So decided, casual is the best option.

Now come to July, we met after I was on holiday for 3 weeks and he texted me daily during my holiday (altho I initially told him let's take a break from talking). After I met him, we ended up"
"Hello ISTJs! In this interview, I got a chance to talk to Jessica about what it's like to be an ISTJ Si-Fi SB/C(P) FM. The first thing I noticed is Jessica's feminine Si and despite it being her lead function, she has a bad memory. We also discussed her double feminine SF sleep and how she tends to have an identity crisis and doesn't feel confident about things she processed. She said she also tends to forget the story of the shows she watches and needs to see them again and again. Jessica said that her NT play last comes out at night and sometimes makes it harder to sleep. So, she started doing martial arts to deal with the extra energy at the end of the day. Jessica is very info-dominant and even if she doesn't want to gather new information, she will for the sake of accuracy. She said there are times she would not text back a friend until she has googled the info well enough that she can provide them with an accurate reply. Jessica also talked about her big road trip in Western United States and how it fed her NF consume and gave her a sense of excitement and gratitude after returning back home.

"Hello ISTJs! In this interview, I got a chance to talk to Jamie and Cherie about their similarities and differences as a standard and jumper ISTJ type. For context, the jumper ISTJ type simply jumps over the Te and becomes Si and Fi first as oppose to Si and Te. We started the interview with Cherie and Jamie talking about their observer problems with their phones. Then, we jumped into the topic of talking about the feeling of disrespected for the standard ISTJ and getting tribe hate from the jumper ISTJ. Cherie and Jamie started making fun of me and said that all NT's like wearing cardigan and it's a nerd thing (looks like I'll have to start wearing my cardigan on some interviews). This interview was actually really funny, with the ISTJs observer problems, making fun of self and tribe, and their weirdness with consuming new information. During our discussion about consuming new information, both Jamie and Cherie said they get really weird about consuming new information. They said all they want is to consume what they've already seen but they're not allowed because that's cheating and you need to consume something new. We also started talking about being a double decider and funny enough we started both praising and making fun of IxxP types (double deciders have to be balanced with praising and making fun of otherwise, it becomes weird). It's all in good fun of course because we like IxxPs as friends. Cherie and Jamie also started talking about their masculine Ne and how their predictions tend to be wrong. They said they feel confident about it because it's masculine but because it's a demon, they don't feel responsible for making sure their prediction is right. Finally, we talked about the Fi + Si identity and how it's not good to tie the identity to your role or job. Instead, you need to look at your role or job and see if they tick all the boxes in your top 5 values. If it ticks all the boxes then it's the right job for you and if not then continue the search.
