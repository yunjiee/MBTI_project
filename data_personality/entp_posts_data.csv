"I mean, really, what did you expect? :happy:

I've noticed that there are a lot of ""ask a ___ a question"" threads in the other forums, but nobody seems to want to ask an ENTP a question. That's probably because you know you're unlikely to get a serious or useful answer. So now you can ask an ENTP a question, with the full understanding that whatever you get as a response will be witty, sarcastic and less than totally accurate.

And, you know, somebody might actually give you a valid answer. If they feel like it."
"We've been getting a lot of threads asking for relationship advice, so I think one of these is in order. 

Are you concerned that your relationship is doomed to failure? Convinced it's been written in the stars? Not sure how to connect with your ENTP family member? Want ENTP date ideas? Worried about excessive arguing in your relationship? Desperate to know if ENTPs are okay with farting in bed? 

You have come to the right place, young padawan. 


 @timeless @Dear Sigmund can we get this stickied?"
"Haven't been on in a while. How about a little self love.

When you debate that poker is not only a sport, but also counts toward your daily physical fitness.

Keep the ball rolling:"
"Just like the ESTP thread, How do you look as a ENTP?

Post picture of your ENTP self and lets see if any patterns emerge - or just be a narcissist and whore it up."
"Whilst lurking on the INFP section, I became interested in the confession thread they have over there. I think we should give it a whirl, so post your confessions. 

I will start. 

I confess that I am tired of the happy life I have been living the past year and a half and craving some of the instability I used to struggle with."

"I'm INTP.

The ENTPs I've encountered seem very exuberant, but after knowing them (only a couple of women) I get the feeling they are less willing to be in contact with their emotions. Is this understanding correct?  It seems confusing to me because I would associate their exuberance with emotions."
"Hey guys I was wondering If you had any experience with meditation or meditative form of prayer

I have mentioned before that I am entering the seminary soon and planning to be a priest and I talk about my feelings about structure in my religion counter to my ENTP nature. I find my Ne and Ti present in my writting and discussions but when it comes to mass prayer and other areas I am very structured. 

I use mindfulness meditate daily, I practice meditative christian prayer (centering prayer) and I participate in the liturgy of the hours and am developing the discipline of a monk in these actions. However once the monk takes of his robes I am a smart ass wild man and a typical ENTP.

Do any of you ENTPs have a meditative or prayer scheduled or just meditate every now and then or do you at all? What has your experience been?"
"Have a read of this website discussion on whether ENTP's actually have introverted tendancies.


			https://personalitydoor.com/the-introverted-entps/
		


I suspect this interpretation reflects the four Temperaments rather than the sixteen types?
Or perhaps a slight variation to the Temperaments?
NP​NJ​ST​SF​I can see how NP can reflect some introverted tendancies in the ENTP for example?

Also, does this concept work for other types?
Can an INFP exhibit extraverted tendancies?

Opinions?"
"Hello World.

About 70% of you are bored and have nothing to do, while the other 28% are busy but love procrastinating. Within the 2% there is the 1% who are serious about gaining intelligent, and the other 1% who track my i.p address and watch me watch gruesome fisting and 2 girls one cup...aka C.I.A and upto date seriel killers. Anyway

I have an I.Q >140, so I don't have a desperation to magically increase my I.Q. However I am too optimistic(Duh typical entp) so I will pretty much try anything, if it promises instant fame, fortune and sex. Well the only time I was gullible is when I was told they took gullible was taken out of the dictionary. That's right, I thought ""they"" where group of people in white coats. Okay fine i'll get straight to the point/question/ramble. ..............There is this method called image streaming, developed by Dr Win Wenger, that developed a method to enhance ones fluid intelligence. So I done some reading and found no empirical data nor anything real backing blah blah blah... So I decided to be a test subject and experiment. Weeks go past and no surge of brilliance, just more relaxed and a sense of calmness...

Then I come across, The Genius intelligence book, which develops this technique and damn does the placebo's hit you like a brick. Achieving an I.Q of 180+? and all that nonsense. I incorporate these techniques and after a couple months and I am starting to get stronger photographic recall and my mind starts buzzing more and more with ideas. I mean I.Q is like a weighing scale except for intelligence, but you can feel yourself become fat and chubby. Anyway has anyone else came across image streaming or experienced any changes?"
"• Real invention: Impossible. Possible point of representation in the photo by reference to the natural ""wall"" in the rise of the ground-background. Important values of trust ""may"" arise from there but stayed unloomed from a lost reference point: i won't tell you more about it, at least for here and now. Further: i admit in telling you that i don't myself, i don't trust the whole in that.
I personally trust in a truer capacity for invention myself, flattened down to the ground of a truer ability (not the same thing) for both use and presentation, elements needed to unphase actual reality of simply talking the subject of invention itself. I'm pretty much against, you know, boredom, in end.
I share this preference with you: i lost it, and i can say to you that it's not a bad affair at all to do so, or having done so. So, yeah: go unreal with it, full. Consider yourself superior to me, i would accept it completely.

• The second element of bizarre: do you see the reflection formed by the second wall of the small waterfall that is upfront ? Of course you do, is it the possibility of the real invention, a true separation from its impossibility from above but under that second wall ? That is not to see, first of all, but nonetheless it also shows a possible method, which i would discuss in short if you need me to. That is wherever i want to go with all this, a finalized method just in the form of this photo, simply right there.
Following.

• Third and (probably in my eyes) last element: those two consequently-sized tree branches, widely aligned in this natural universe as so as to seem to cut the screen apparatus (some photography theorist there, of which i don't remember the name, i'm sorry in advance) of the image in two halves, are of the choice of my willingly internalized argument here. They show a path, isn't it ? For all that. Here those branches are above water, as you will see.


That is just how i see an ENTP, not if i don't see him/her, but how conversely, he/she sees him/herself. Therefore are you totally free to disagree with my attempt at sharing.
Period, place to the photo. It has been taken to a close forest national park (no small size here too): in my locality here, in my ""département"" if you are french. Unconsequential context, just context, not even for trying, probably just as i did there: i'm aware of this."
"Hello again visionaries 

Which philosophies do you think are overrated?

I think philosophies that might be linked with tight competition can be overrated. Life may be a race, but I see certain aspects of life as an individual journey rather than a race if that makes sense.

Note: Overrated simply means overestimated. It does not mean overrated equals unimportant."
"These people I went with, went to sleep like 8-9pm!

And, I am like sitting by myself until 11 then even that is too early but I DON'T sleep at 8-9pm hell!

I also don't think you live your life fully, going to bed that early."
"ENTPs, I'm looking for some help.

I really want to work on my thinking and logic. I find myself in trouble and hurting people because I make decisions based almost entirely on how I feel. I really don't want to keep ruining my relationships with people. I form them easily, but can't maintain them when I hurt people. What sort of filters do you use to process your thoughts before you make decisions? 

Anyone can answer this, but I figured if T was all I changed, I would most resemble an ENTP."
I'll start. All of the food in the kitchen has to be put in food storage bags and with dates written on whenever opened. I am so pissed off with this rule and it does not make any sense. No other household does this.
"It's so hard.  I so fucking hard.  I'm so shit at it.  I want to get a decent job in the future and become a doc.  You need to get good grades to do that.  I could get grades, but I can't physically do what I want.  In my head I say, ""I'm going to study.""  Then I don't. 

How do you just do it?"
"Hi Cognitive Masters,

I'm looking for a little help organizing my cognitive functions. I'll post some details, hoping you can reach a conclusion:

16 personality tests: ISTJ -> INTJ -> INTP -> INTP -> INTP -> INTP
Michael Coz: INTP 100 points; ENTP 92 points; ENFP 75 points.
Me self typing myself when learned about cognitive functions.


Me as a baby

I cried a lot.

Me as a Kid/Puberty

Always attached to my Gameboy and Pokémon games (sleep with GB in pockets)Wet the bed.
Just want to play videogames, watch TV, or play baseball with neighbors?I hide behind my mom when I catch somebody's attention.

Me at School

More focused on playing baseball with friends or videogames than actual girls dating.
So Shy I was unable to tell the girls I liked them.
I was so reserved. Some crazy girls did me what they call sexual harassment: they grabbed my buttocks and yelled in class how in love they were with me (which, of course, was more to annoy me than to flirt with me).

Me at College

Sit at the back of the classroom.Nervous while speaking in front of class.
As soon as class finished, I reached home.

Me at Work

Late arriving (although the schedule is flexible since IT is
I love to annoy a small group of people, but in a childishly offensive manner. I want to annoy you a little without offending you.
I rebelled once again against my boss (I ignored him) and told his boss I would quit when I finished my duties. His boss sent me a meeting, and I declined, stating that it was not necessary to talk. This latter boss (3 levels above me in EVP level) sent me a meeting and told me he cancelled a meeting to speak with me, so I ended up lowering my anger and accepting the meeting.
If I like you, I don't tell you; I annoy you.
If I hate you, I treat you very seriously.
People just say, Ah, it's just ""my name,"" when I do something they find weird.
I hate bosses who abuse those with less power (not fair).I tend not to speak with bosses or VPs, although I find more joy talking with the lowest-level analysts and helping them learn something.
I tend to say I would be a bad teacher because I don't have the patience, but people tend to say I'm good at explaining things.
I prefer my subordinates to do the talking while I keep analyzing things.
I procrastinate a lot.
I always crack a joke in the middle of a serious or non-serious topic (it takes me longer to be promoted, though).
I get angry at rules or situations where people are closed-minded.
I hate politics and find it stupid when people prioritize high-ranking bosses over anyone else.
I'm so much requested outside work hours so I prefer to turn off my work phone than accepting the call and tell them to fuck off.
I have changed my personal phone number several times. Now nobody from work can call me on that number and I can rest.
I cannot see something wrong without my mind trying to find a solution.
I don't talk that much. Just burst of time.

Me at home

I'm the oldest brother, so I try to behave more appropriately.

Me out there alone

Reversed
Don't show my goofiness.

Me out there with close people

I display my goofiness to friends, whether people watch or not.
I enjoy making people embarrassed but despise being embarrassed myself (hypocritical social anxiety).

Love Life

Sucks
I'm kind of not that ugly, but I feel so tired of going out and meeting new women.
I'm worried that if I get married, I won't be able to buy my favorite gadgets (I love gadgets).
I flirt by doing stupid things like making silly faces at the girl or asking stupid things.
I never pick up on women's signs. Women end up telling me they like me, or some friend of hers tells me.

Health

I'm on an SSRI for social anxiety for the fourth time. I always quit on my own when symptoms relapse.
I'm a little hypochondriac.

Me in general:

I have compulsive behaviors, which I relieve with emotional shopping and eating. (I'm on a $20k USD bad debt right now.)
I'm a perfectionist.
I make hasty decisions and keep ruminating about whether other options are better for my OCP type. I doubt myself a lot.
I feel terrible fear on rollercoasters.
I'm afraid of flying and car speeds.
I distract very easily.
When people yell at me, it's perfective, and HP gets to 0. Loud noises and crowded places discharge me fast.
People don’t always know when I’m joking sarcastically or talking seriously.
I have an inner child who likes minions, Pokémon, making people laugh with silly behavior, and making SFW, non-sexual, non-derogatory, and non-offensive jokes. I want to annoy you, but not hurt you.I suppress my emotions with fun and jokes and try to divert the topic.
I hate anger, sadness, and every strong emotion, and I hate showing them to people.
I’m not an organized person.I try to avoid debates or discussions because something inside me wants to say something, but after that, I want out of the discussion because I'm a little anxious or get involved in the heat. I prefer to hear people debating.
I have much creativity and intelligence but am too lazy to keep focused or finish something.
My brain skips between thoughts on different topics instead of going in sequence. Ex: I'm writing a letter, but before I write the last part, I remember I need to fix a backend service for a colleague. I end up leaving the mail in draft and sending it days later.
People laugh when I make a mistake. They find me funny even when I'm not joking.
My brain absorbs every problem, even the ones I need to resolve, and I blame myself for the problem. Ex.: Mom is arguing with my brother; I must fix it. I tend not to look at problems, so my mind won't hurry to fix them.I am afraid of making a mistake, and when I do it, I feel ashamed, and it bothers me a lot.I say I don’t care about what others say or think about me, but I do a little. SSRI makes it easier to ignore.Overthinking is my best friend, and Benzos doesn’t like it.
I have a playful, fun side with people I feel close to or with people who haven’t yelled at me.
When there are no bodies around at work, I do feel lonely. I prefer a few people around that let me in peace but keep close enough.
I'm good at brainstorming solutions for problems I create due to procrastinating.
People tag me as different or crazy.
People say there’s no way I'm an introvert because I’m very fun and smart. Part of the exception is IT workers who know how to communicate with people.
Social pressure can make me spit ideas, and the good ones need to be filtered.
I’m more preoccupied with the future.I can be easily distracted from what I'm doing because my interest has been piqued by something else or because somebody has stopped by to say hi.
I have periods when I'm social, fanciful, and impulsive. Those times are usually followed by quite a bit of downtime and quiet introspection.
I take things personally.I like to watch or listen to heated discussions, and sometimes I start them.
I'm not that into reading books; I'm more visual.
I try to read people's faces before trying to softly annoy them.People at work like to include me in interviews because ""I’m good at reading people.
""I hate authority and have had problems with people three levels up in the company where I work. Nothing disrespectful. Just when my emotions can no longer be held. I just exploded in a crazy, sarcastic way.
People seem to love me more than I love myself.
When I'm at the store I prefer to spend time looking for the thing that asking for help finding it unless I'm in a hurry.
I hate to be hurried.
I constantly try to improve things even at the expense of spending my money or time. I always said when X it will be perfect and I will settle. That momento never comes so I keep repeating the cycle never resting.
I feel curious about people who are reserved, mostly women.
I enjoy the behavior of some ENTP fictional characters: the Joker (I like to watch bad people burn like C Levels from my job), Iron Man (quick brainstorming, sense of humor, good but self-absorbed), Jack Sparrow (good disguised as weird),I tend to finish lunch at work and visit another small group of people I know and bother them or make them laugh.
I love Gengar and Deadpool making fun of things.
I won’t ask for help when needed, but eventually will let my pride lose so minions can work on the boring part . Exception at work because I'm a manager.
I try to do everything by myself almost always, and subordinates’ complaints about me doing it at work
When at home and on weekends, I shut off the social button and close myself in my bubble
.I hate super-crowded spaces and loud noises.
Thank God for noise-canceling earbuds.I dress like a hippie. Mother hates that. I went to my brother's prom in Crocs, and Mom turned into Karen.
When I'm down emotionally, I don’t want people around me.
When I’m not social, I don’t want people around me.I second-guess myself a lot on big decisions.I like birds.
I'm very pessimistic.I tend to get surprised when I say I can only do 40 and end up doing 100."
"Analyzing the “ENTP growth phases” meme
					

This also applies to INTP.




janjilecek.medium.com









































Keep it going! Post your favorite ENTP Memes!"
"ENTPs are often pegged as argumentative folks, so I just want to ask the ENTPs on this forum: How argumentative/confrontational are you and what is your style of confrontation (ex. sarcastic, direct, etc.)?"
"I'm an ENTP woman and sometimes, it can be a little frustrating when women end up disliking me because of my personality. My male friends have told me that they find me intimidating, but it has never been an issue with any of them. In fact, I jive better with guys than with other women because the former seem to love a challenge from me while the females seem to hate my guts. (My boyfriend is an ENFP and we get along fine. It's great that he understands that I prefer hanging out with my guy friends every once in a while.)

I've actually been consciously supressing my ENTP side when I'm with my female friends, but it's exhausting trying to be all ""nice and sweet"" when I'm with them. I actively keep myself in check when I open my mouth, but it doesn't seem to be enough for them. So far, only a handful of female friends actually get me (and know I don't mean any harm when I start talking), while most (close and mere acquaintances) just think I'm a jerk.

(Sorry, I'm ranting here... I just recently decided to cut ties with a group of ""friends"" I hung out with for the last 4 years because of their close-mindedness and clique-ishness.) But really, I genuinely want to know what other ENTP women experience with other non-ENTP women, and how they deal with it."
Argue only on the side of yes. Go.
I posted something similar to the ENFP section. Who here is a lawyer? I'm taking law classes and need law acquaintances.
"I suspect INTP, ISFJ, ENFP, but maybe some you who are more into this stuff could help me?"
"So I had a horrible couple years, culminating in a bad breakup. I dropped everything, and started working on relationships, which turned into emotional work, which turned into spirituality.

I was running from my feelings to the point where I could only express frustration, anger, and happiness. But I stopped running from them, and experience them all, and process them all.

Because of that, my decision-making processes changed a little bit. I'm more empathetic, more careful with my words, more outgoing, and less bound by logic.

All the brains are still there, I'm still adept at what I do, I'm just a lot more emotionally stable.

It makes me question whether or not I'm still an ENTP. It seems that my hiding behind logic was to protect my inner emotional state. I never showed anyone authenticity, because if they can't see my inner being, then they can't hurt it. I saw the descriptions about ENTPs being uncomfortable with the irrationality of their emotions, but there's nothing rational about emotions. So it appears to be some sort of coping mechanism ingrained in the ENTP, to protect itself from its own feelings.

I'm just curious if anyone had any similar experiences. I don't think I've ever spoken with an emotionally mature ENTP, it seems to be an oxymoron. Or maybe I just wasn't looking for it. Unable to see it."
"hello ENTPs
As I was perusing some mbti stats, I came across an infograph showing ENTPs as having the highest rate of being self-employed. 
For those of you who are self employed, what prompted you to go on your own vs be someone else’s employee? What do you enjoy most about your own business?"
Tell me about your mates. What is their MBTI type? Enneagram type? Instinctual variants? What are they like? Why did you choose them? Share a memory. Anything...
"Okay, I don't know very many ENTP females. NT women in general are something of a mystery, since there are so few of us. I was talking to my one ENTP female friend the other day about hormone levels, and it raised an interesting question: Could ENTP females have higher testosterone levels than most women?

I am very curious as to how brain chemistry effects personality development. It seems that most of the NT women I've met are very confident, very sexual and sometimes very socially dominating, all of which are characteristics of high testosterone levels. ENTP is considered a very masculine personality type, and I personally score very high on masculinity on every test. Could this actually have a chemical explanation?"
"I did a lot of research lately and I've narrowed it down to 4 types. I'm XNXP, which means that I have Ne in the first two slots. Could you ENTP ask me some questions or have a conversation with me, so I could narrow it even further? I'm currently asking about it on all 4 NP forums."
"I'm just curious as to what you guys might notice about your eating habits. 

As for odd eating habits...The only thing I can think of for myself really is that I have this weird thing with the texture of food. Can't be slimy or soggy mostly.

I eat my bowls of cereal dry without any milk or spoon...I can't eat banana's if they are too ripe or I gag...I can't eat oatmeal with fruit in it because it gets slimy.

I also don't care for certain foods touching other foods but i'm not that bad about it like some people. They can touch but if something wet were to make something that was supposed to be dry soggy then I get pissed.

I also apparently put too much ketchup on everything."
"I know this looks long but I was saving from people having to click a bunch of links to articles and boiled it down instead.

@Desthro brought up an article about ADHD with regard to my organizing things that interest me but neglecting/forgetting about every day organization. As I read the article, it made me really think about how much ADHD symptoms are so similar to ENTP personality traits (usually described as our ""weaknesses""), how can you tell what is a ""disease"" and what is having Ne-Ti in the front positions. 

I have never been officially diagnosed but I suspect I might be ADHD; however, I have always been able to use life hacks to function pretty well, even as a child. I am forgetful/disorganized but very responsible (probably more responsible than most ENTPs) and my inability to sit still has usually been used for good rather than evil (helping other people rather than just disrupting). Really though, am I ADHD or an ENTP with high Ne? Anyway, here is a list of ADHD ""symptoms"" vs. ENTP ""traits"":

ADHD
Lack of focus: Possibly the most telltale sign of ADHD, “lack of focus” goes beyond trouble paying attention. It means being easily distracted, finding it hard to listen to others in a conversation, overlooking details, and not completing tasks or projects. The flip side to that is hyperfocus (see below). 

Hyperfocus: While people with ADHD are often easily distractible, they may also have something called hyperfocus. A person with ADHD can get so engrossed in something that they can become unaware of anything else around them. This kind of focus makes it easier to lose track of time and ignore those around you. This can lead to relationship misunderstandings. 

Disorganization: Life can seem chaotic for everyone at times, but someone with ADHD typically has a more hectic life experience on a regular basis. This can make it difficult to keep everything in its right place. An adult with ADHD may struggle with these organizational skills. This can include problems keeping track of tasks and trouble prioritizing them in a logical manner.

Time management problems: This issue goes hand-in-hand with disorganization. Adults with ADHD often have trouble using their time effectively. They may procrastinate on important tasks, show up late for important events, or ignore assignments they consider boring. They may have trouble focusing on the future or the past — the “now” is often more top-of-mind for them. 

Forgetfulness: It’s human to forget things occasionally, but for someone with ADHD, forgetfulness is a part of everyday life. This can include routinely forgetting where you’ve put something or what important dates you need to keep. 

Impulsivity: Impulsiveness in someone with ADHD can manifest in several ways: interrupting others during conversation; being socially inappropriate; rushing through tasks; acting without much consideration to the consequences.

Lack of motivation: While you might be open to doing everything at once, you also may feel unmotivated.   Coupled with procrastination and poor organizational skills, this problem can make it difficult for an adult with ADHD to finish a project because they can’t focus for long periods of time. 

Restlessness and anxiety: As an adult with ADHD, you may feel like your motor won’t shut off. Your yearning to keep moving and doing things can lead to frustration when you can’t do something immediately. This leads to restlessness, which can lead to frustration and anxiety. 

ENTPs
1. They love change. ENTPs are always looking for something new and gets bored with routine and having possessions with them for a long time. Once something else comes along, they get distracted. This is also evident in the way they handle relationships that they tend to hop from one relationship to another.

2. They easily get bored with people and things. When they feel a friend is not able to help them in a positive way or is not being a good influence, they are open to letting go and move forward. Moreover, despite their being innovators, once they lose interest on what they do, they end up leaving them unfinished. 

3. They are risk-takers. This can be a weakness at times for ENTPs since they often do things without thinking twice of the outcome. These can include financial risks like starting businesses because they find them interesting at first. 

4. They love arguments. ENTPs enjoy asking questions and asking the views of other people that it often ends up in a debate. Simply because they want to understand things and look at a situation from different perspectives, other people see them as confrontational, making big things out of trivial matters. This can affect their relationships with other people. What’s ironic is that they only want to understand things more clearly.

5. They have the tendency to have unfinished jobs. The faster ENTPs get excited with new things that interest them, the faster they lose their passion on them when things begin to be a routine. When they are not happy with what they do, they lose the drive to stay on it and will want to leave and do something else. 

6. An ENTP may show some a lack of sensitivity to the feelings and ways of those who might need reassurance, security or commitment.

For those of you that have been officially diagnosed, how is ADHD different than just being an ENTP?"
"Hi

First time post, I' dont really expect anybody to understand what the heck I was trying to do or understand my actions but hopefully somebody can give me some advice on how I can fix this.. and english is not my main lang. 

I'm a ENTP and I didn't figure this out until couple of months ago. So I have never heard about personalities or done any research on it. 


This is my story; I'm gonna try to keep it short.


It started when I was really young, in the beginning of my 20's. I started to date 2 girls at the same time ( had sexual relationship with both) , and I ended up with one of them into a full time relationship and moved in with her. The other girl ( she is a ENTP which I did figure out recently ), I did still keep contact with the other one but only couple of times a month at best. 

My main problem is how to deal and move on with the girl that is a ENTP. From the very start she knew that I was dating a other girl. She knew that I still am in a relationship. I did not have sex with her expect from in the beginning which is now almost 10 years ago. 

So the years past by and I did have contact with her. We both love to talk to each other and we understand each other perfectly. I did visit her couple of times (maybe 3-4 times tops in a year ), we went out and had great time. I mean, it was fucking AWESOME. We went to a bar and we went there to get something to eat. None of us had time to even read the meny so we always ended up with not eating anything. That feeling when time just pass by in a split of a second, it always felt like magic. It did feel like a date, every single time. And at the end she did kiss me. ( We didn't have sex for 10 years and she never invited me home in the last years )  I know that for a fact that she was in love in me at some point. So I told her that we could't be together because it won't fit at this point of our life. We both had a huge mess in our life, it was like a disaster. She did agree.

In my head, I wanted to keep her. Whatever the price it would be. I love every single second that I'm with her. But for my part, it could be just like a great friend. Somebody that would be around with me for the rest of my life, somebody who can take on my bullshit.. She is the kind of girl that I could go out and pick up boys and girls for both me and her, lol! Just for fun obv!

Recently everytime I was there to visit her, she started to make up things to avoid to meet me. I don't mean those normal things like ""I' have a headache, can't meet you. "" It looked like a game of power sort of thing. I asked her first if she was avaiable on friday and she said yes and wanted to meet me. So I bought tickets to a stand-up show, and I thought we both needed something to laugh of. And the thursday comes, she said me this msg - "" I don't like that you didn't ask me if I could be out that late, I just wanna ditch the hole thing now. "". Yeah, she had work next day, but it was never a problem before. We always did hangout late, work or whatever didn't matter.

I don't have those msgs anymore, but in most of them she is attacking. I don't understand why.  
Like if I didn't respect her or something like that. So I got really pissed because it did happend couple of times and it fucking exploded, and now she won't talk to me at all. We had this huge fight, I mean she won't give me any answer on what she wanted and expected from me. I told her, just be straight with me. I did push her so far that either you will do it, or.. yeah, she blocked me now. None of this made any sense in my head, nothing. It never happend before, even when she was in a relationship. 

Just to make it clear. I' can be a fucking asshole, I' can be a douchebag but not vs this one. Never! I was really straight with her about my feelings, thoughts and action I was really trying to make her days and mine better, and I was trying to improve on every single lvl. She also did make me a better person overall. She also loved every single time we went out. I was always trying to find something new to do. Like not even for a date, but as exp in life in general. Things that we havn't done before.


Summary of our relationship.
We could never figure out what we had, but whatever the heck we do have. It' was great, it was beyong awesome. And this happend out of nowhere. 

I'm stuck. 


Dunno what to do now?
Is it really that simple? She was just in love with me and she knew that we couldn't be together?"
"OK so I met this guy that I believe to be an ENTP on Tinder. By the second time we went out for dinner, I felt insane chemistry and connections with him. Then few days after, we ran into each other again at a bar (actually he knew I was gonna be there and told me he and his friends might hit up the same place So when he did come later that night, I went downstairs (lower floor of the bar) to say hi, and we ended up dancing and leaving the bar together and hooked up (booze involved of course). That night while we stayed together I kind of let on that I hadn’t done it (the deed) for a long time, and I wasn’t sure if he got the hint that this sort of impromptu hookup isn’t actually something I typically do. But anyways we had a pretty great night. 

The next day when we were about to part ways I only quickly hugged him while saying goodbye, then just went downstairs to the subway station (cuz he seemed to be in a rush to go meet his cousin for brunch as they had planned it beforehand). But later that night he texted to check in. We briefly exchanged a few texts. The next day we texted again and I asked him if he’d like to meet in the next few days as I will be out of the town over the weekend. He told me sure but since his cousin is still visiting (from another country), he wasn’t sure when he would be available. Upon hearing that I told him it’s ok I’ll just let you hang out with your cousin then, no worries, or we could play it by ear. He said ok he will let me know if he’s not doing anything with him. However I just never heard from him again for the rest of the week. 

The following week I texted him again asking how he was and if he’s still hanging out with the cousin. He replied and told me yes and now his boss is also in town attending a surgery conference. We briefly exchanged a few more texts again and I just left it there because I didn’t want to bother him. Also at the time I didn’t have a good feeling about where this was going and thought he probably wanted to end things already and withdrew. However, few days later, he texted me again telling me that he’d been busy taking his boss around touring (his boss flew from the U.S.) and just got back from the gorge (a famous scenic spot in my country which is fairly far away from the city). Then he told me that he has to fly back to the U.S. for a job interview for a few days, but maybe we can hang out next week after he’s back. I told him ok let me know then. 

We did not contact each other for the following week as again I did not want to bother him, since I assumed he would be busy preparing for/having the interview, plus visiting family/friends and stuff. A week later he did text me again, but told me that he kind of met someone on the plane that he has a pretty good connections with, so he would like to see where that goes. And he typically doesn’t like to get involved with multiple people at the same time, so if we meet it has to be totally as regular friends. I was too upset upon hearing that so I did not respond at all. 

Few days after I calmed down, I figured maybe I should still respond out of politeness since he at least wasn’t trying to string me along. So I texted back, and that was already two weeks later, first thanking him for being upfront with me. I told him it wasn’t something I was happy to hear, but I do appreciate his honesty, and that we could totally stay friends and maybe hang out later when we have time. Also I wish things are going well for him. He replied by first thanking me too and saying that ok maybe he can tell me his untold story if we hang out haha (the story he said he will tell me later when we had dinner before). I said ok! And that was it. 

It’s been two months, honestly I was so hurt because I really like this guy and I have a hard time believing he would have a stronger connection with someone that he just randomly met on the plane that he’s willing to just drop me like that and choose to proceed with her. 

I have been trying to keep myself busy and move on because I thought his behavior after we spent the night together and the things he said had all made it clear he has no interest in taking things further or even getting to know me better. Sometimes I thought I’ve felt better after this amount of time passed, but somehow recently I’ve been itching to reach out to him, because as I said above I just have a hard time believing he did not feel the same level of connections/chemistry we had as I did and I really was just caught up by my own fantasy/wishful thinking. I’ve been suppressing the urge to text him but I feel I couldn’t withhold it any longer. Could some fellow ENTP guys shed some light on this? And what’s your take on me reaching out to him at this point? (we have not contacted each other at all over the past two months)

One thing I did think about is that although I believe my behaviors should be quite telling that I am into him, I never confessed my feeling to him nor did we talk about any relationship stuff during the time we spent together (we did have some raw revelation about ourselves that’s why I thought we had a connection), Because to me it was also too early to talk about that kind of stuff since we’d only met for three times, but I actually wanted to get to know him and was interested in exploring a relationship with him (we are both in our thirties so of course I am looking for a possible long-term mate). I just never had a chance to convey those thoughts to him because things happened too quickly. And he probably has no idea I’ve been experiencing so much emotional turmoil during this time. Because you know, as an INFx type, we are usually not too gushy at the beginning and we like to give people space and not to be bothersome (that’s also why after we spent the night together I didn’t initiate text/contact much either because I wasn’t sure what he wanted) 

Do you think I still have a chance with him? What’s the best course of action I should take right now? Just continue to try to move on? And could anybody help explain his behavior to me? If he just saw it as a casual fling, why did he still bother to stay or even initiate contact with me afterwards? Was it because he knew he wasn’t ready to take things further but actually likes and respects me as a person enough so he would rather be upfront with me than hurting me even more down the road, hence the initiation of contact but suggestion of hanging out as friends? Or is it purely just a form of polite rejection? Also, do you think it's possible that he felt the pressure of commitment after sex so he spooked and wanted to jump right back into the dating game upon first opportunity presented (the lady on the plane)?

Thanks in advance and sorry for the long post :frustrating: I am a newbie here although I’ve been lurking for a while. roud:


*Another thing to add is I could sometimes come off as an outgoing, live-in-the-present, go-with-the-flow kind of extrovert if you haven't known me well enough, as I am a people person and know how to have fun when the time is right. So could there be a slight possibility that he thought I was also just looking for some fun?"
"Hey all. First thread, so while I wouldn't bother being gentle, a little lube would be appreciated.

I'm currently studying Physics at University level and as usual my ENTPness is simultaneously saving my ass and fucking me up. I just lack the mental discipline required to actually become mathematically competent, but as an ENTP I can still rapidly cram and do just over average with basically no work. This puts me in the awkward position of seeming to be all talk - which I am at the moment - interspersed with explosions of violent intelligence that leaves more methodical coursemates jealous and a little passive aggressive. As Physics students intelligence is a very strong factor in everyone's ego. Obviously I need to hide my intelligence a little bit, at least in respect of Physics, to stop others feeling threatened. I digress...

What I'd like to know is how many of you other ENTPs are strong mathematicians and how did you learn? At the moment I'm just doing exam papers but it's slow going as I haven't really ever done anything more than the bare minimum and I'm not keen on using textbooks to help me - I don't want outside influences effecting my natural creativity. It's a weird toss up between launching straight into the Physics stuff so my intuition can actually get something to hold on to or to stick with the maths so I can develop my Ti more fully. To be frank, my understanding of the whole MBTI system is shaky at best. 

Anyways, any feedback on this would be appreciated. 

On an unrelated note, really enjoying these forums. It's nice to be reminded that I'm not the only one who thinks the way I do - being an ENTP can be seriously fucking lonely sometimes.

Peace"
"INFJ here, first time so I'm so sorry if I posted in the wrong sub-forum?

My boyfriend and I took the test together and it has explained so much about our differences and just the overall dynamics of our relationship that I'm now rather terrified. Terrified mostly because as I delve more into the type (ENTP), the less secure I am feeling (a need for INFJs to feel).

Don't get me wrong- I love who he is. I love that he has this childlike demeanor at times when I'm too serious. He's playful, all over the place really, goes off tangent in conversations that I've gotten used to, and he's brilliant. He has told me he loves me and that I'm witty, smart and beautiful (which I guess is a plus for him especially), ""so deep"" and that I always keep him on his toes.

But then there are so so many articles about just how much and often the ENTP male (and maybe even females) ""get bored"". I'd like to defend and say that it is not so much sheer boredom but the fact you guys love newness and adventure. I mean my boyfriend can't sit still. The pandemic was especially hard on us (more so because he likely felt constrained by the walls of his home). I tried my best to cook him meals and help him see the good in the mundane day to day (the best I could because even I went a bit kookoo during this pandemic). Anyway, but there are so many articles written by ENTP males who outright admit that they can't seem to commit, to settle down, to even begin to imagine life with only one person for the rest of it.

And I'm here just like ""oh..."" Insert happy face with small tear rolling down

I'm not asking for marriage tomorrow or even within the next year. I'd just like to know or have a sense that that's what we are working towards (and maybe that's the annoying need-to-have-a-plan INFJ trait in me or maybe its just a sense of security?).

I feel like overall INFJ+ENTP complement very well-- I might just need to strengthen my logical/thinking and let go of some of my emotions. He can maybe work on developing his emotions a little more since he does come off insensitive at times but I know he is not ill-willed.

He tells me I'm ""reading too much into all of it"" which I probably am. Can someone help me out of this rabbit hole?

PS) I don't know if it matters but just to paint a picture - he's a very busy investment banker and I'm a (introverted) lawyer."
"A lot of the ENTPs I met flirt a lot, and to be honest I have no idea what is genuine and what is not."
"So I was perusing a blog called MBTI Truths, and found a post about ENTP's being the ""best"" type. Interesting read, but the real diamond in the rough was this comment (warning: it's a monster-read lol):


""Here's my take with all the dirt. An ENTP looks great from the outside because we make you laugh, we give you true insightful criticism, we know all about your interests, and really ""understand"" you -we know logically why you feel like you do, even if you don't. We find creative ""why didn't I think of that"" solutions to not only your life problems but your computer problems too. We can charm your grandparents, your parents, and your friends. We can party with the extraverts, and sit in silence with the introverts. We can talk Trek with nerds, and Baudelaire with artsy-fartsies. You probably didn't notice us in high school because we were in our embryonic pseudoINTP/INTJ morph. But you got surprised when you saw us back from college break and though we looked different (aka more desirable). We seem now just oh so dreamy and exciting.


But all that takes a -lot- of energy. It's a performance we put on tailor made, on the spot, just for you. Eventually we get tired and the mask slips off. That's when you think we're shallow or self-centered, but the truth is, you misunderstood our performance for personal interest. (And maybe we did too -- it's easy to lose yourself as a method actor.) But we're just as cold and analytical ruthless as the other NTs: We don't nitpick you apart like an INTJ, or categorize your usefulness like an ENTJ, or test your mental capacity like an INTP. We understand you by (subconsciously) pushing all your secret buttons…for good or bad. Maybe you fell in love with us, but now your angry and conflicted because you don't understand why we're suddenly being cold and distant. We've retreated -- because while we're good at faking emotion, and logically understanding why people feel a certain way, we're really terrible at actually handling emotion. We get overpowered by it and annoyed by the illogicalness of it. ( Besides, we've already found a new shiny.) Now you hate us…but here is some consolation. We have a built-in nemesis and he's a real bastard.


We turn that critical wide-ranging eye on ourselves. You can't see it from the outside, but were utter perfectionists in our heads and we relentlessly measure ourselves against the realistically unachievable. Somehow we can't find the same easy solutions to our problems as to everyone else's, and we become mired in too many possibilities, haunted by how inadequate our own creative efforts seem to us. We at once believe our own hype, and ruthlessly condemn ourselves. We'll may you our creations (probably something 1/2 finished). We secretly want your praise, like an 8 yo child. We don't accept your garlands though (unless you're an expert we respect) -- because we've already judged ourself against Perfection and came out wanting. If you tell us you think it's good, we won't believe you. For what you mistook as bravado and arrogance, is really very wry, very sarcastic self-mortification. 


We can stagnate in our mess of ideas, with no external system of organization to help us move forward. We have brief mad rushes of energy --back, forward, right, left, a random walk of ideas with a net movement of zero. If you're really smart, being an ENTP is a double curse…because your ideas are loftier, your movements more wide-ranging, your internal critic all the more perniciously accurate. You stand on the shoulders of titans, glimpsing something wonderful across the jungle of possibilities, and sketch out a map.


But then it happens: SJ reality. They turn off your water because you forgot to pay the bill. A check bounces because you didn't know how much money you had in the account. You burn dinner because you're suddenly obsessed with typing out a manifesto on a blog. You tell a friend you'll meet him at 7:00 and show up at 9:00. You forget to call your mother on her birthday. You put off simple annoyances (like depositing a check) for weeks. Your mighty creative intuition gets mostly employed to talk your way out of the stupid jams your procrastination landed you in. People with lesser talents, pass you by and you make excuses: (The internal critic says it's because your stupid and lazy). You don't get the promotion because while you have a lot of good ideas, you don't follow through. You're unreliable. You have no problems expressing your boredom with your job or critiquing your boss publicly in front of his superiors, not realizing the implications. SJ boss now -really- doesn't like you. You get A's in some college classes and F's in others -- but all your NT professors still think you're intelligent, even the one's giving your F's, because they've fallen for your charms and excuses. 


But people like you -- they think your unique, clever and entertaining, because you are. They give you chances. So you pick yourself up, dust yourself off from your failures, and try again. Maybe you get your self another brilliant ENTP friend and start Apple Computer. Or write Candide. Or invent Quantum Electrodynamics. Or host the Daily Show. Maybe tomorrow. Or Next week. But what you'll probably do, instead of working on finishing a paper your supposed to be readying for peer review, you'll spend an hour typing out a cathartic blog post that's maybe more about your own insecurities than being an ENTP.


So is ENTP the best of all the types? Hell yes it is. =)"""

"Hello there ENTPs!! INFP here! OuO

Just dropping by to say Hi! 
I hear you guys are awesome, enthusiastic and hmm...~ very intellectual people.
I wonder if anyone out here would like to be friends with me hehe -looks around- :tongue:

Anyway, nice to meet you!! <3"
"I don't smoke, I'm not interested in becoming addicted to Nicotine. But I can't lie:
https://epipemods.com
these are cool, and the vapors smells good when I'm around other people. like candy. 

I'd be tempted to get one of those pipes and nicotine free vaper juice if I weren't concerned about the toxicity of inhaling that stuff. 

the vegetable glycerin and distilled water seem to be harmless enough. and the P-glycol or whatever is supposedly harmless as well since it is in asthma inhalers... Is this true?

the flavorings though? even if the above is true, the flavorings seems to be a wild card because apparently there are foods that, when inhaled, cause damage. like fake popcorn butter which is supposedly used in vaper cigarettes. 


I don't know. any of you out there have experience in this? I love cotton candy, and if I could inhale it without making myself sick... (hehehe)
with one of those sick pipes (hehehe)

also, do you have to inhale it into your lungs? couldn't you just suck on it like a cigar. seems like you should still be able to taste it if you keep it in your mouth, and that would be safer since the concern with some of these ingredients is not how they digest but how they affect the lungs


edit: just found a site that said vaping is more enjoyable if you don't inhale but hold it in your mouth instead... so ugh. I might start vaping. smoking nicotine-free candy lol.

edit 2: just thinking, I live in Cancer Alley next to 2 oil refineries, a sugar refinery, close to a coffee plant, etc. Should I really be worried about the chemicals in an vaping device?"
