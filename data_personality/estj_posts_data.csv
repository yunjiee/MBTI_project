"So, most other forums has one like this, but I couldn't find one here. 

(think we'll need one regarding all the stereotypes here...)
So guys (and girls), just go on and shoot any questions you'd like!
(other ESTJs are welcome to answer as well of course, but I guess you don't need an invitation for that..)"
"H all,

Just noticed that we have not got one of these threads for our types. Lets start one then.

I hope there will be enough people to keep this one going. :happy:

This is me (standing) and the girl sitting is actually ESTP:"
"Tell me what ESTJ stereotypes you have heard of. This is in no way an attack on ESTJ's. This thread just gives awareness to the stereotypes of the ESTJ personality.

Here is my list of ESTJ stereotypes..

1.) Does not question the law
2.) Conservative
3.) Bullies
4.) Unprogressive
5.) Paranoid
6.) Bias towards their own beliefs
7.) Critical of others
8.) Strict
9.) Boring
10.) Direct and truthful when communicating with others."
"I read about ESTJ fashion from socionic site.

It said:



			ESTJs clothes are mainly executive or classical in style.            Men prefer the traditional suit and tie. When choosing clothes ESTJs            will pay much more attention to comfort and quality than to the latest            fashion. Female ESTJs do not often wear extravagant things. Even if            they do try to follow fashion their choices will always maintain an            element of conservatism. 

In general ESTJs are very careful and cautious with their clothes. Their            clothing is always neat and clean. They may keep clothes for a long            time and know well how to preserve them. Even if some items are quite            old they still may look like new. ESTJs do not like untidiness and carelessness            in their appearance and in general. Trousers are always ironed, shoes            polished, etc.

My questions to you ESTJs:


Do you find this description somewhat true?
What are your considerations in choosing clothes?
What do you want to look like?

How do you define your fashion style?
Show me some of your clothing & fashion style."
"Or, if you don't mind, what do ESTJ men look for in women.  The title is politically correct.  This incorrect question is the one I actually want to know an answer to."

"Hi all, I'm new here. Me( INTJ) and my estj boyfriend have been in relationship for 4 years. We had our own rough start but at one point we really liked each other and was deeply in love with the way we are. We started working, Now situation have changed terribly this whole year he havent given any time for me or the attention whenever we talk about that it ends up in a fight it became like a loop and last month when the same issue came up, he said he is done and he blocked me in all forums. He is going to cafes, movies and all sort of fun things with his new friends or alone. He said that I dont understand his stress and kept blaming me for that. Today I lost it and shouted at him in imessage but then also he didnt care. Did i get fooled by his love for 4 years or did he change into someone i dont know? He threw me like a trash and I as an intj cant move on without solid reason I keep thinking and reaching him out it might look like im begging to him. Can anyone explain what he is going through?"
"Hi, I'm brand new to this forum and just recently settled on ESTJ. While most everything fits, I have been reading that ESTJ's don't ""get"" emotions and in general, we don't get others being sensitive and that we welcome conflict. Although I am very aware of functioning out of my Te and Fi, I am very sensitive, feel emotions deeply and experience epathy for others as well. I am drawn to people and animals that are suffering or lost somehow and naturally come along side them. I've also read that we can leave relationships easily but one of my greatest fears is abandonment. Also am devasted by conflict in close relationships. All this but I'm mostly in my head. Should I be checking out other type possibilities or is this something others here relate to?"
"Hello,

I have a friend who is ESTJ, I think she's brilliant and I really enjoy her energy and conversations.  

My ESTJ friend has fallen out with a girl we were both friends with I suspect jealousy is at the core of the problem (the girl is single and playing in the same field as the ESTJ greater success in attaining male attention).  

My question is do ESTJs get jealous easily and if so what's the best way to deal with this?

Thanks!"
"I have two right now: 

1. My manager. She takes time to look into what I’m saying. She wants to help individuals and the company both —which is the best way to go in my opinion. her intensions are great. She gives the benefit of the doubt, which I see as a huge part of her success in relationships as an ESTJ.

2.  My patient who I just saw.  He told me he wants true love in his relationship with his partner like he saw with me and my husband and I see he has this now.  It is beautiful.  He also is SO positive— always working to keep positive and I am so grateful for that.  He sees what others do and appreciates everyone.  What a good example to me and others!"
"Why all the hate for ESTJs? I don't know all the lingo so forgive my uneducated thoughts...Years ago I found the online test and was amazed at how accurate it was for me. I had (okay truth is I originally wrote MADE and automatically was like damn this isn't helping the case but they had fun whatever) my family and friends take it, was a fun time. Over the years I've retaken the test to see if I've changed and other than a closing gap from extroverted to introverted everything's pretty much stayed the same. I have an ISTJ mother and sister. An ISTP father and ENFP partner for 16 years. Our family has its troubles like most but I'm the glue that keeps our family together (my immediate family, my partner is another post haha). I talk to my mom like multiple times a day and while I find things about her extremely frustrating we are very close. We both just care enough about each other to work through it.

Personality types aside I consider myself to be an empath. Like, I'm not emotional about my own feelings often but someone else's grief will overwhelm me. Could be a complete stranger, in a moment I can put myself in their shoes and become a blubbering mess trying to process their sadness/grief.

I have close friends who I like to think greatly enjoy my company and I've never had issues making friends in new places, often these people will seek me out or make some statement that I'm such a trustworthy, honest, fun person to be around. Coworkers know I'll lighten the mood and generally make work a fun place (not just by doing more than my fair share). 

I can absolutely be domineering and its something I struggle with, because I find it hard to let go of control (I'm just so good at quickly coming up with the best, most logical plan to execute things with no detail forgotten) but I am adamant about admitting my wrongs. If I'm wrong I will genuinely, directly admit it. Now I hate getting chastised when I am wrong, but understand those that are inferior need to shoot their shot on the rare occasion they can 

I get that scratching the surface of us being bossy, especially as a woman, but I am a caring, kind person who genuinely tries to help people, I live for those in my circle and would do anything for them. My kid is my world and I want a laid back parental relationship with him where he can tell me anything. I try desperately to be a crunchy mom! I try to suppress initial reactions to things fostered by society so he can just be him (thinking along the lines of letting a boy wear a dress or play with dolls).

I'd love to think I'm just not an ESTJ, with all the negative opinions I've read from other types, it would be an easy way out, but I know its not true so if you've  made it this far, what's the deal?"
"What do ESTJs think of ISFJs?

Personally, I really like ESTJs. They are very hardworking, strong, confident, organized, proper and reliable.

They also have a gentle and kind side!"
"Honestly surprised I have found nothing on ESTJ and INTP relationships on here. 

Supposedly, ESTJs and INTPs are compatible types.
As a single guy, I'm trying to find someone compatible with me.
INTPs also match with ENTJs, but good luck trying to find a female one. 
But truth told, I don't know much about the ESTJ.

Does anyone have experience with an ESTJxINTP relationship?
What is dating an ESTJ/INTP like?
Where do you FIND ESTJ women? (preferably single)
What are ESTJ hobbies/interests? (Or just your hobbies)"

"Hi, everyone! I’m an ISFP looking to learn more about ESTJs! If you’re interested please let me know"
ESTJs can cheat often in life because for success?
"Hi! My ESTJ friend is going through a very dark time-- disease, loss of a family member. I want to support her in the way that she needs to be supported, but don't know how. As an Fi-dom (ISFP), I shut the world out to process the overwhelm, the last thing I want is to be bugged with condolences and ""check-ins""...Don't have Si to tap into and offer her comfort either.

I suspect that, she processes her Fi-overwhelm very differently from me, but am completely bewildered.

What is a helpful way  to soothe her?

What words would help her feel understood and supported?

She lives in a different country from me, we see each other once or twice a year."
"ENTP here, I know this side of the forum is pretty much dead because ESTJ's are most likely out working 23 hours a day, but I do want to say that I enjoy working with ESTJs.  When I'm home I'm lazy as shit, but when I'm at work I always want to be on my feet, I want to work, I want to get shit done.  And I work in a blue collar job, so we're always outside doing heavy lifting, and I love it.  And it's the ESTJs that make sure all the shit gets done.  Without ESTJs at my job, it would take twice as long, it's the truth.

The one big thing I have in common with you guys is that if there's shit to be done, get it done, and anybody that wants to be lazy...fuck 'em, tell them to go home.  Now as an N type I think there's a better way to approach a situation like that instead of just saying ""get the hell out of here"", but the concept is basically the same.

In social situations we are complete opposites and we'd probably get on each other's nerves, but I respect anyone that knows how to work.  Sometimes I wish I was an S, being an N gets exhausting, you have no idea.  Overanalyzing everything, thinking deeply into everything, it's insane.

But yeah I respect the hell out of you guys.  We don't always get along, but I think there's a certain mutual respect between the two types that's pretty awesome."
"You guys don't get offended,but do any of you have a sense of humor?
Im married to an ESTJ roud: love of my life is just Im not able to enjoy a comedy movie or anything that I might find funny is not funny to her.
Even though she laughs at the simplest of comedy *dog sniffs butt*

Tell me please about qualities you want in your dream partner. What are some adjectives you appreciate? What makes you interested in someone? 👀"
"Hey!

Every time I have done the MBTI tests I have been labeled an ISTJ. Now, I do identify with many of their characteristics and I thought I was an ISTJ for a long time. However, recently, I have started to doubt that I am an introvert. 

When I was younger, I was a bit overweight and I got bullied by people I regarded as popular and important at schools and in sports teams etc. It made me extremely self conscious and I feared everything - from voicing my opinion to taking my shirt of at a public pool (last time I did that was maybe 7 years ago). Even though I lost the excess weight a long time ago and I now work out 6 times a week, I think I still have the same mindset. 

I study at a prominent university and I always feel like everyone else is better than me and dislike me. Unfortunately, I think I always value people in terms of popularity etc. and if I think that they are of high value and able to hurt me and influence others to dislike me, I feel threatened and distance myself from them in order to avoid getting picked on again. I also over analyze absolutely everything after having a social encounter with these people and it is driving me nuts. 

This has led to me being very socially inactive at uni, which is pretty much the only time I socialize. I have like one or two close friends and I have a very hard time taking commando socially since I presume that everyone dislikes me and wants to hurt/shame me. I often dream about living on a deserted island somewhere far away where I do not have to think about other people - it is so energy draining to constantly overthink everything I do. 

However, I recently attended a social event with video gamers, people I consider less judgmental and more accepting, and I found myself immediately taking charge socially even though everyone were complete strangers etc. I felt like I finally got the opportunity to use my natural leading and organizing instincts. I had a blast and when I got home I was so incredibly happy and filled with energy, which made me think I was actually an extrovert. Even though I have things in common with ISTJ's, I prefer working alone etc., I really think that I need more social interactions to be happy and energized. I want more friends and people to talk to. But since I fear everything, I force myself to withdraw and suffer the painful feeling of regret. 

Could it be that I am actually and extrovert and that my poor self esteem and my social anxiety qualify me as an introvert on the tests? Do any of you ESTJ's struggle with poor self-image and social anxiety? How do you fight it? How do you stop caring about what other people think of you? I hate being this self-centered and judgmental.

Also, sorry for the long ""blog"" post, I did not intend to write this much at first."
"Hello ESTJs! In this interview, I got a chance to talk to Holly about what it's like to be an ESTJ Te-Ne PC/S(B) FM. During the interview, Holly talked about her double masculine NT play and how she loves problem solving with the tribe. However, because she has ST blast last, and also because she has Fi at the bottom, she has trouble making the final decision and usually leaves it to the tribe to make the final call. Holly also talked about her feminine Si and feminine Fi and how taking time for herself to process her feelings is a challenge. This also includes setting boundaries. We then discussed her double activated NF consume and how she loves reading and learning about things that helps her grow as a person. Holly then talked about her IxxP swing and how she never ever wants to go back to a place like that again hence why she is working diligently on her SF sleep. According to Holly, even though blasting is hard, she is not triggered by it because it's still her first two functions. At the end of the day, the Fi at the bottom is what would trigger her with the feelings of self loathing. Finally, we covered her visual and tester sexual modalities with her having a good eye for aesthetics and a keen sense of smell. Watch this interview here:"
"ESTJ maybe best type compatible with me in a relationship and I did not meet them

"Hello ESTJs! First, Amy talked about her masculine Ne and seeing so many possibilities and being very confident about it. She said she avoided getting COVID as a result of her predicting that a certain trip to California would cause that to happen. Amy also talked about her double activated Fi thanks to having consume and sleep in her first three animals. Being lead play, she said she does want to be around people a lot but if she is alone, she also likes it and it does recharge her. Amy has double activated double masculine NF consume which helps her know what she likes and what she doesn't like and also pursue self growth by gathering new information and experiences. Amy also talked about being a tester and having her favourite smells and hating certain scents. Finally, we talked about Amy's confidence and being a decider and being afraid of people yet because of her self-work, she has cultivated an inner peace about herself which is great to see an ExxJ accomplish.

"Hello ESTJs! In this interview, I got a chance to talk to all the ExxJ types about their shared experiences and what makes them different from one another. During the interview, we talked about ExxJs having trouble making a decision for themselves and needing permission from the tribe before making decisions. We also talked about Te shaming Ti and Fe shaming Fi. Savannah asked an awesome question to the ESFJ and ENFJs on how Te's can be more sensitive to Ti's and not offend them. We also discussed what their Ti or Fi swing looks like when they go on a ""selfishness"" swing. We also discussed racist jokes and how they perceived it as an ExxJ. We also talked about blood and family ties and how the ESFJ and ENFJ perceived it differently from the ENTJ and ESTJ. Double observing was something we tried discussing but the topic was too boring for the ExxJs to continue talking about because it's so easy for them. In the end, the ExxJs had a message to say to fellow ExxJs on how to better themselves as individuals. Some things I noticed about each participant include Julia (ESFJ and our only info-dominant ExxJ) did an amazing job maintaining the flow of the conversation being balanced with her Si+Fe and Ne+Ti. Maggie (our jumper ESFJ) was relatively quiet and focused on gathering the tribe's perspective. Rob (our jumper ENFJ with double activated Ti and token male ExxJ) was acting very ExxP like with committing to decisions. Savannah (our jumper ENTJ) asked some very good questions to the lead Fe's. Nina (our jumper ESTJ and only lead NT) was doing a makeshift double decider which shows how present that masculine Fi is at the bottom when double activated. Natalie (our ENFJ and only MF) produced many hilarious moments including before the interview with her blast to Nina just seconds after learning something from Julia. And finally, Heather shows the big difference between an ESTJ and ENTJ when it comes to dealing with presenting themselves to the tribe. I also thought it was interesting that Julia being info-dominant was not as scared of how the tribe perceived her as the energy dominants were. Julia said she can clarify with the tribe which shows the easy flow of information while Natalie said she never thought of asking the tribe and just assumed everyone hated her.

"Hello ESTJs! In this interview, I got a chance to talk to Tamara about what it's like to be an ESTJ Te-Si BP/C(S) FF. Tamara talked about having double feminine ST blast and how it comes across as Fe at first, especially when she joins a new group, but people soon realize that she's trying to Te fix problems for them. She also talked about how she loves the NT play and how she does it all day and problem solving with other people is something she enjoys. Tamara thought she was saviour consume but turns out it's because her NF is double masculine and she can really see it as well as the fact that she is info-dominant and having the most accurate information is important to her. We then talked about SF blast and how Tamara has trouble sleeping, and neglects processing her emotions. Tamara also talked about having trouble having a consistent health routine for herself. We then talked about her Fi love and hate and Tamara was apprehensive to share them since her Fi is at the bottom. However, once she got started, it was easy for her to talk about her likes and dislikes. This was especially true when we talked about her sexual modalities and being a tester. She loves smelling different perfumes and trying different foods. Watch this interview here:"

"The object of my affection happens to be an ESTJ. There is a very intense attraction/pull to one another that is mutual. He is everything that I am looking for, but there seems to constantly be a hesitation to pursue anything serious. I don't know if it is common for ESTJ men to be afraid of serious/romantic relationships. I also understand that you can't base compatibility solely on personality type. What I would like to know is ""what are ESTJ's take on INFP's"", ""What can you tell me about the relationship/dynamic"" and ""How can I learn to better communicate with him?"". Thanks in advance!"
"Hello ESTJs! In this interview, I got a chance to talk to Ashlee about what it's like to be an ESTJ Te-Ne PB/C(S) FF. Despite the fact we have the exact same animal stack, Ashlee and I were still very different thanks to the difference in our function stack. Ashlee talked about how difficult it is for her to express what she likes and what she doesn't like. She talked about planning her wedding and letting others decide what cake she will get, what kind of dress, etc. Her fiance (officially typed as an ISTJ Si-Fi SB/P(C) MF) is helping her use her Fi to decide for herself who she wants to come as the bridesmaids. Ashlee also talked about it's easier to do things for other people and she likes solving people-related problems with others thanks to her NT play. Ashlee said she had trouble seeing her blast at first because her blast is double feminine and actually had an easier time seeing her consume because it's double masculine. She talked about finding inspiration every time she experiences something new which goes to show how she's very ExxPish as a jumper ESTJ. She feels baffled that other types can't double observe because she thinks the balance between Ne and Si is not as difficult as Te and Fi. Ashlee also talked about her hulk syndrome when the masculine Fi swing comes and she stops caring for other people (in the moment) and just focuses on herself. Watch this interview here:"
"So I met this guy 6 months back on a dating app, he is an ESTJ and had recently broken up with an ex of 2 years. Considering this, we should have taken things a bit slower but he told me that he and his ex had been drifting apart for months beforehand and that he was over it, and he was pretty convincing. 

So I decided not to worry and just go with it as I'd never had a bf before. And I was glad I did because I had never been happier than I was when we started dating. We like all the same stuff, music, films, tv shows and have a very similar sense of humour and it felt like we were made for one another. Even though we are very different people, it felt like we got each other and for me, it was perfect. And he told me he felt the same way. I mean this guy doesn't seem like the type to express his feelings but he would tell me every day how he was so glad he found me and that he had never loved anyone this much before. A couple months back he even opened up to me about his dad's death (which is unusual for him) and cried in front of me (also unusual). It brought us even closer. 

And he continued to make me feel secure and happy in our relationship until one day, I got a message saying he thinks we should take a break, that he hadn't been feeling the same way lately and he needed space to figure out what he wants. I was confused because he hadn't been acting any different and he was the one asking me about going on holiday together only the week beforehand. But I agreed to give him space. He still insisted on texting all the time during this 'break' and still flirted with me, it didn't make any sense. So I suggested we stop texting for awhile so he could think and hopefully make his mind up faster. The next day he broke up with me and said he just wasn't ready for a relationship and he couldn't ask me to wait. But from recent posts on his social media, it's pretty obvious he wants his ex back. 

I posted his here because I was curious if any ESTJ's might be able to understand his mind and how he changed it so quickly? As an INFP, I find it difficult to understand how someone could be genuinely as in love as he made me believe he was, and then want nothing to do with me the next week. Is it pointless for me to hold out hope for him changing his mind back again?"
"hello, i'm coming to you regarding my mother. i've always typed her as an esfj, but now i'm starting to think estj 2w1 with high Fi. there's no doubt of the auxiliary Si, but she seems more Fi than Fe, her need of pleasing others is in her roots, but that may occur because of the 2w1 enneagram. she has Te. she is also going through some issues right now.
so, for estjs here, maybe a 2w1, could a estj act like an esfj?

if you know an estj 2w1 it would also be really helpful to get another point of view of that person in an outsider's view"
Thinkers are often thought to be cool headed and calm. It is normal for ESTJs to rarely display anger and not having frequent angry outbursts?
"Hello ESTJs! In this interview, I got a chance to discuss extroverted intuition, introverted sensing, extroverted thinking, and introverted sensing with all the types that have this function stack (INFP, ENFP, ISTJ, and ESTJ). In this interview, we had Natacha (INFP), Annie (ENFP), Cinzia (ENFP jumper), Heather (ESTJ), Nina (ESTJ jumper), and Hannah (ISTJ jumper) share their stories and struggles in regards to the functions they are good at and the ones they have troubles with. One of my favourite takeaways from this interview is how ESTJs will use ""objects"" to get rid of emotions because feelings are scary. ISTJs will also use ""objects"" to alleviate negative emotions since they have Si above Fi; however, because they aren't scared of people since they are a double decider, then they won't have problems asking for help from a therapist or friend/family to help them process those feelings. Another interesting take away is that ISTJs and ESTJs have a tendency to have foreboding joy and if they are too happy, they feel like something bad is going to happen right around the corner. Nina for example talked about seeing hedgehogs and think they are so cute and she is overwhelmed with positive emotions; however, she also starts thinking about how the cute hedgehog will die and how bad she will feel if she sees it pass away. With the ENFPs and INFPs, they have Fi above Si regardless of whether it is a demon or saviour, as a result, they feel more comfortable processing the negative emotions. However, because ENFPs and INFPs have Fi above Si, having a steady health routine (healthy eating, exercise, sleep) is the bigger struggle. For INFPs, it seems that they put pressure on themselves to build up that Si routine. For ENFPs, some will need to recruit help to hold them accountable (Ne-Te's) or put pressure on themselves if they have saviour consume and sleep. Watch this interview here:"
"How would I do this? Winning the argument itself with facts is not a problem. The problem is to get them to acknowledge defeat and stop trying to use transference with logical fallacies and ambiguous phrasing.

My step-dad is ESTJ and we get into petty arguments a lot. When I prove him wrong he will respond with one of several things:
- Total silence as if the argument never occurred. Eventually he might say ""I don't have time to talk about this right now!""
- Repetition of something that asserts his position of power over me (ex. ""It's my house!""), or repetition of his original position which has been defeated.
- A logical fallacy, usually a straw man or ad hominem.

He also has this way of phrasing statements as questions so that my only possible response can be in answer form, not counter-argument form. It is very hard to explain so I will just save it.

Basically, what is the most effective way of getting an arrogant ESTJ to realize and admit they are wrong? I need tactics, strategies... What has worked on you in the past?

(This is assuming there are, ironically, ESTJ using Internet forums.)"
"Hello ESTJs! In this interview, I got a chance to talk to Daniel about what it's like to be an ESTJ jumper Te-Ne PC/S(B) FF. First, Daniel talked about loving his Fi and doing Fi all day long. However, if the tribe comes around and asks for help, he said he feels responsible to help them. Because his Play is NT, he likes to solve problems with the tribe in a collaborative way. Because he has trouble using his ST blast, he rather show the tribe how to do something than teach them or tell them how to do something. Daniel being NT play is also very prominent as he told me several clever NT jokes. For example, he said when someone says something to him hurtful, he will pretend it didn't hurt him but in reality, it's like him being a grass Pokemon weak to a fire Pokemon. Their attacks (words) would be super effective on him. He also talks about being energy dominant and being balanced with his energy levels. Because he is an ExxJ-ExxP, he does get bored of routines quickly and wants to channel change making sticking to a workout or diet difficult for him. Daniel also talked about his fear of judgement as an ExxJ and how making friends was something that was tough when he was younger because he was picky with people but was also grateful when he was older when another tribe adopted him to join their group.
