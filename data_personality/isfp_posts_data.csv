"Since we don't have a thread for posting our artwork despite our title as 'the artists', I thought I'd start one.  

I'll get the ball rollingg lol

















I like colouring pencil as you can see haha"
"Why don't we have this thread?

Questions away!"
A place to share anything on your mind
"It was a good idea, and I had to copy it. :wink:

My style, well recently has changed over the years I must say, I guess it is only because I have had money of my own, and I'm starting to look at fashion differently. I used to wear a pair of jeans everyday and a polo shirt, or just a plain t-shirt, and felt pretty comfy. It was better than those sweats and t-shirts I wore when I was younger. I can't believe I wore sweats outside. 

I dress for comfort, but it has to be fashionable, I don't think I really express myself through my clothing choices, yet I could be wrong. I'm in love with floral prints, knitted dresses, lace, and pretty much clothes that are the colour purple. I wear jeggings, and jeans a lot though. I'm pretty ""chic"" I guess. It's best with a picture I from polyvore. ;] Of course I couldn't afford all of this, but this is a sample of what I would wear."
"We need one of these.

I will start. 
You know you are an ISFP when, you know the difference between a 2B and a B pencil."
"I stole this from the INTJs and the INFPs: we'll see how it takes off here.
So, ISFPs, spill the beans! Confess as many or as few things as you want. <3 

1. Sometimes I doubt I'll ever have the selflessness/commitment to be in a close friendship or a relationship, but I'm starting to accept that I have to make an effort with people sometimes, instead of just assuming someone doesn't like me and distancing myself. 
2. I feel so boring and avoidant (which I am) atm, like a broken record. I don't feel like I'm living.
3. Masks might be painted in elaborate swirling detail, but the real thing is so much richer.


Your turn."
"Did this for the ISTPs, now I'm going to try/ask here.  
Why so little Youtube vids?  I get it -- shy, blahblahblah, but I'm trying to analyze the body language portrayed by certain types, and there are hardly any ISFP videos.  

Ehm, so, why not make some?

"Tell me what ISFP stereotypes you have heard of. This is in no way an attack on ISFP's. This thread just gives awareness to the stereotypes of the ISFP personality.

Here is my list of ISFP stereotypes..

1.) Artistic
2.) Rebellious
3.) Animal Lovers
4.) Caring of others
5.) Too serious
6.) Romantic
7.) Loners
8.) Overly Sensitive
9.) Very Kind
10.) Pushover"
"Might as well post this. Don't be shy! 


Here's me in a confused state:"
"Dominants
Fi - someone really hurt my feelings
ACTION-REACTION
Se - Serious punch in the face

Inferiors:
Ni - Um... there might be consequences, I guess...
Te - Do I do sth about it? I might try, I mean ""try"" doing sth about my situation. Nah, the person who dared to piss off my Fi is the fault, of course he would be punished. Never mind, then. whistles with a smile."
"Its important to remember you are who you are for a reason. You might not understand why you made your choice, but there is a proper reason which holds real value.

  We cherish things. Its okay to do so. Even if no one else does. Instead focus on why you cherish that thing. Focus on what it means to you.

  We make things from abstraction. You don't need to explain it. You don't owe anyone a meaning behind your abstraction. But make it, forget it, throw it away or keep it and move on without letting anyone tell you why you did that. This post being an exception of course.

  Growing up you may make many decisions that don't add up or make sense. They will eventually.

  Don't forget, you are valuable. You matter. You can't get the feel goods everyday. But that doesn't negate your worth or impact."
"ISTP here trying to understand Fi, so I thought I’d ask the Fi doms directly. How do you experience your Fi? I thought I’d share my experience with Ti to help, my Ti just comes to me, if I’m looking at the problem by observing or “tinkering” the observation is working out the problem logically in the background, unbeknownst even to me. Then all of a sudden I get a idea, an answer out of no where. Sometimes one answer, sometimes many, then consciously I pick which answer is the most likely to work and try that. If it doesn’t work, through trying that idea I’ve pulled in more information so I get more accurate ideas and try those till something works. But Ti feels truly like a light bulb someone just flipped on.
So how do you experience your Fi?"
"Well I have a Male ISFP friend that share a group of friends with me for some years, he was a bit distantat the start but got closer with everyone over the time. Recently I've been having mixed feelings about him and I may have developed romantic feelings for him, I am an INTP so I overthink a lot and it took a really long time for me to figure out my feelings. Well recently I decided to take things slowly but I really want to show my feelings and try to get to the next level but... I find his behavior a bit weird for me to understand, recently sometimes I found him oversharing some things(things he didn't use to do) and getting close, even a bit clingy. On the other hand sometimeshe will feel only distant from me from the group(online and IRL), he will ignore me but later will try to talk and be friendly and close, these things didn't used to happen so I think he may know that I started to try getting closer(or maybe not?).

I would like to add that one of the things that holds me back is that I don't wanna try to force things until it gets strange and it may ruin the friendship...
So I would like to ask for people that may understand if someone could give me some insight."
"Sort of a long post, but this is my first time dating an ISFP person and could use some advice.

I'm a 33 year old gay INFJ male. In June 2022, I went on a couple dates with 31 year old ISFP male (let's call him Taylor) who is finishing his residency and will be starting a new job summer 2024. After the second date, he was forward with me and said he wasn't up for a relationship at the time. I was new to my city at this point and thought we got along well enough to make a new friend, so I said I was okay with doing that if he wanted. So up until September 2023 we were strictly platonic friends. I also learned after the fact he had only dated one guy in his life for 6 years, who ended up cheating on and ending things with Taylor shortly before we met.

However, I always thought there was something still there. I ended up acting on this one night in early September and since then we have been casually dating for the last few months. He also ended up admitting he had interest on his end, but didn't want to mess up our friendship and never acted on it (which part of me is still worried about). We've hung out way more frequently than we did prior to this, as much as his residency schedule will allow (was 1 - 2 times a week, with some weeks not seeing each other). I feel like we've had a lot of fun and both feel very comfortable with each other. He's openly stated he trusts me and we have been communicating honestly about where we're at. I typically don't do casual dating as an INFJ (it's difficult for me not to bond with people) and this is the first time I've dated someone I had been friends with before, so this experience is new to me. From what I've read, ISFPs usually only casually date to see if someone is a good match for them, but IDK if that's the case here. He's said he's never done any sort of FWBs before, so I've been curious about our ""situationship"" and why he's entered one with me. There are times we hang out when we don't hookup, even when staying the night. So I know he's not solely in it for that aspect. As a caveat, he's likely moving to a city 2 - 3 hours from where we are now in 9 months.

Recently we talked about where things are going and he said he feels like he doesn't want anything serious at this point because he's not at a place where he can 100% invest in me like he should. He said he likes being with me, finds me attractive, is intrigued by me, and feels like he should want to be in a relationship with me, but is not there. He also said if he got to the point where he could totally invest in a relationship I'd be the first person he'd want to try to seriously date. He also said I'm currently the only person he is making time for besides his best friend, which I know means a lot coming from an ISFP. We're going to spend this upcoming weekend together, which is a first (we haven't hung out for multiple days in a row yet). He isn't trying to date or hookup with anyone else right now (has no interest) and has directly told me this, but has said if I felt like I needed to move on and date other people he would understand.

So I guess my question for other ISFPs is how I should approach this situation? I'm trying to look at this realistically. I know there's a chance things will not work out in the end. However, I believe the things he's said are true and he's just not placating me. We've talked how staying in each other's lives is the most important thing and if we needed to go back to being friends to maintain that then it was the priority. I've been on the fence about how long I should give him to feel things out, as I know I won't be able to keep myself from getting attached to him after an extended period of doing this. While he is making time for me, there are some things I'm not sure how to interpret. I tend to do most of the date planning, but I know ISFPs aren't big into this. He's also sparse communicating between hanging out (can go a week or more without talking if I don't reach out), but on the flip side the last time we talked on the phone it was for 3.5 hours (he did a ton of the talking). He's told me he doesn't like his phone much, and when we're in person he's very present and rarely looks at it. He also doesn't ask a ton of questions about me, but has been opening up more on his end and seems better if we're just reflecting on ourselves vs. me asking about him. But on the whole, I get the impression he is way more comfortable with me taking the reins on everything. He even waits for me to make the first move when we are hooking up. Are these typical behaviors for an ISFP or red flags?

From what I know, ISFPs need time and be free from pressure when deciding something major like choosing a romantic partner. Also, I'm sure being cheated on has done a number on his ability to commit. I'm not in any rush to find a relationship and not really tied down to my city, so there's a part of me that wants to wait it out and give this a chance while not being blinded by idealism. I've never had the opportunity to date a friend, and it's been super nice that we already know each other and can focus on hanging out with naturally learning more personal things. I directly asked if maybe I just wasn't right for him and he said he didn't think that was the case, and once things were settled he could be in a better place for a relationship. I've also asked if he wanted to end us ""dating"" and go back to being friends, since I'll be gone for a month over the holidays and it was a good breaking point. However, he doesn't seem to want to do that. Is he just keeping me at a distance to know if he is sure there is some sort of future there, or is this just an emotionally unavailable ISFP? Should I just go with the flow and see how the next 9 months turn out or should we go back to friends and tell him I'm open to things in the future but can't sustain the current situation as it is? Any straight / real advice from ISFPs would be greatly appreciated."
"Hello everybody!!😚 Thank you for looking at my post. Recently I got carried away studying SP types and was surprised how many of my favorite male characters are ISFP. I am, by the way, ENFJ girl. Now I'm in search of at least one real ISFP, we could exchange our experience in studying MBTI, find out how your second Se and my tertiary will connect and just have fun chatting! Thank you for your attention, write to me definitely!!💞"
"Any ISFP Male have experience dating a INTJ Female? How was it like? I know INTJ and ISFP, share the same cognitive functions. 

Fi Se Ni Te ISFP

Ni Te Fi Se INTJ"
"Hello everyone. I created this account to ask you guys for input about a situation I'm having with a girl I'm sure is ISFP (obvious Fi and Se, quite reserved) since I'm Fi inf and have trouble figuring you guys out. I'll try to make it as brief as possible.

So, for a while I noticed this girl was always near me, would often stare and give subtle signs, even sitting next to me when there were empty seats and I saw her smiling at me.
I never talked to her nor gave her any sign back, it was just an awkward place to do it and it would go wrong for sure, but now she acts like she completely despises me.
She was just behind me in queue these days and suddenly just queue-jumped me. Another day, I had no choice but to move closer in and she started to face away from me, I wasn't even showing any signs that I'd talk to her. She's always around my view showing her back as to sign she's not interested, but still I still catch her watching me sometimes.
I'm sure it's a unpleasant situation for both parties to be in, and all I've done was minding my business, and now more than ever it's all I can do, anything else would just make things worse.

It's clear to me she's sending a message (a very negative one lol) but I'm too dense to understand why, she could just ignore my presence and go on with it as I show it's clear I'm not going to bother her."
"Have you ever seen an ISFP 4w3 468 whenever their laptop breaks? They cry hysterically, they scream like young children, they kneel down and pray to the internet god that their laptop will fix again, they tightly hug and caress their dead laptops and make sexual moaning noises, they buy a Facebook Marketplace Windows XP laptop (because modern laptops are too ""UgLy"" for their Fi-Se sx4 aesthetic taste) only to find that the internet barely works and then they cry even more, they contemplate suicide, they rely on others to fix their laptop because they're Ti-blind, and they claim that they prefer computers over people when in reality the opposite is the case because they vent to others relentlessly. And this is all because they urgently crave external validation on Personality Database and Reddit (Snapchat and TikTok are for ESFP's) due to a 6w7 fix and a 3 wing. They don't care about using the internet to research drugs on Erowid (wannabe INTP), learn Dutch on Duolingo (wannabe ENTP) and reluctantly and tediously do their mechanics write-ups on Google Classroom (wannabe ISTP)."
"I have read elsewhere that there are correlations between MBTI type and measurable intelligence.  I have also read that there are not correltaions between MBTI type and intelligence.  While I don't really know what to believe about how MBTI type relates to intelligence, I am curious to know what high intelligence looks like in sensing types because I am an intuitive type and I don't really understand the sensing preference that well.  

  I posted this in the ISFP forum simply because it made sense to pick a sensing-type forum for this question and I therefore had to pick one.  As far as I am concerned, any sensing types, (or anyone who has insight into highly-intelligent sensors,) are welcome to answer.

  When I think of intelligence, (as it is typically defined and measured by tests,) I think of pattern detection, ability to learn with fewer examples, ability to extrapolate and make accurate abstractions, etc..  How does this effect the sensing functions?"
"So I've been trying to figure out if I'm a ISFP instead of an INFP. 

Any advice or any differences that you notice? I feel like I focus a lot on Fi and I think I'm intuitive but I think I might be using Ni instead of Ne."
"Right where to begin. I met an ISFP girl and she has either brought out the ISFP in me or made me hate the INFP in me. We went out and I felt like an ISFP. She broke things off and now I feel like an INFP but I hate the feeling. Either way she's fucked up my Fi and I feel very shitty very intensely at times and I can't control my feelings.

A year ago I took many tests and 95% of the time, out of like 12 tests I was typed as an INTJ, I even bought Please Understand Me 2 and yeah - INTJ. 

Lately, over the past 5 months I've been feeling different, very emotional and so I took the test again in the book - INFP/INFJ. Took a ''Are you an INFP or INFJ test and was INFP. I then realised that ''Holy shit, of course I'm an INFP. What a fucking idiot I've been all this time.'' But then I read descriptions and the ''You know you're a XXXX when...'' threads and well I related to the ISFP the most. And I just can't decide. 

At times I'll realise that I'm an Se user but feel like I would prefer to have Ne instead. And then when I think I'm an INFP I would think ''SHIT! You live in the moment! You want to live in the moment and you do you little bastard! Decide already what your type is!'' 

I'll be honest I'm a bit of a lost soul at times, definitely a P. Definitely a Fi dominant.

I think I might be an ISFP because the INTJ uses the same functions and the tests recognised those functions in me but in the wrong order.

Or am I an INTJ but just been fucked up by this girl? What do you think? I'll tell you more if the info isn't enough."
"I'm curious as to whether anyone here has an INTP child, or for any INTPs reading this, have you an ISFP parent? Mother, especially? Would you be kind enough to share your experiences? My mother is an ISFP and I find that we are extremely different. We don't really ""get"" each other, and it really frustrates me at times. Everything that we think, enjoy, say, etc. are profoundly different and I find that I have a difficult time enjoying her company unless we're basing every conversation and action together on something plain, simple and everyday which is eventually too boring and one-sided for me.

I don't have the ""standard"" relationship with my mother that most people may have. I wasn't raised by her (no, my parents aren't divorced or living separately) and we have an odd ""acquaintance"" relationship which both of us feel the need to improve. It's while I'm trying to build a relationship with her that all these differences and annoyances come out. I realise that the cognitive functions for INTPs and ISFPs are very different. Would that be a strong contributing factor to this?

Does anyone else have any similar experiences? It's funny though, because one of my adored friends is an ISFP as well. I can see that we have very different values and thought processes though, so while I adore this friend of mine, I'm not 100% comfortable around her but she's better to be with than my mother, it seems. Another thing is she can't offer emotional support to people, I find, for she's rather awkward about it."
"Ignore my signature, I could be a mistyped ISFP sx 4. I hate rules that do not make any sense to me, and this is why I often think I'm an XXTP type. I fucking hate rules, especially if they make little sense. For example not being allowed to go to my mother's house whenever there is no adult to supervise (I'm 17, this is fucking ridiculous), or putting all of the food in the kitchen in food storage bags whenever opened. Such a stupid rule."
"I went to my mother's house today (which I love doing because I know it sounds stupid but every time I go there I frequently find joints on the floor in the local region and compulsively smoke them because I don't know any dealers) but immediately got kicked out because I swore at my father because I was angry with him because he was angry with me. I got stoned anyway, and my day was pleasantly interrupted with an EDT appointment, but I was just so sad and pissed off with myself because of what I did. I hate how impulsive I am. I hate how I never think about the possibilities and potential consequences of my actions. It makes me feel like a mistyped Se-dom and being an ESFP sounds even worse than being an ISFP because I don't want to be perceived as unintelligent. I wish I was an XNTP because it is my identity.
Later that day, when I went for a walk in the kid's home area, I found no joints whatsoever and tried smoking cigarettes (which helped but only temporarily). I am a transgender male with an eating disorder and I encountered this attractive thin young man who said a witty comment and had a deeper voice than mine and I feel really jealous of him. I also remember crying because other people were making fun of me (combined with reflecting over what I did). I hate it when my mother sends my smartphone text messages such as ""You have to think about the consequences of your actions"" crap along those lines. It's just so inconsiderate. Does this make me sx4? Am I a mistyped ESFP? I don't want to be.
When I got home I also realized how ugly my hair is."
"I remember reading that ISFP's are often very competitive. That was one of the few things that didn't make sense to me. But then I thought about my childhood. I remember losing more than winning. I remember it really bothering me too. It's not like the desire to win wasn't there. I remember in sports I always had plenty of strength, speed, and endurance, more than most. The problem was that I have poor coordination, and I have a slow reaction time. So anyways, I think I just got sick of caring and being butthurt about losing (not just in sports). So I fell asleep. Well, almost. I still feel the remnants of my lame ISFP ""competitiveness"". But then that's when I basically in my subconscious realize ""But oh yeah, I'm not gonna do a damn thing about this. So I'll just forget about it now. snore "" 

Do any other ISFP's here feel uncompetitive mostly? Does anyone know uncompetitive ISFP's? Did you/they get that way in a similar way as I did?"
"Your opinion is appreciated! I'm on the fence with typing a friend of mine and it's driving me crazy. Here's a description of him. 
He's very musically gifted and plays the drums, trumpet, piano, and anything else he can get his hands on. He's a dancer, particularly good at ballroom dancing and is a master at Swing Dance. Everyone is his friend, and he'll do nearly anything to help someone in need or to make someone feel better as long as it doesn't go against his morals, and he's irresistibly charming. Very involved in his church and leads the children's ministry. He loves children, and they're drawn to him. He's very smart, remembers a lot of facts and details and very clever, but he dropped out of college after his first semester. Currently working as a carpenter in the family business with his dad and brother, and also does gardening. He's very athletic, and he loves nature. An expert in all things outdoors, and an adventurous mountaineer. Last year he drove to Maine with his friend to camp out in the mountains for 2 weeks and climb. He's very social, and is almost always doing something with somebody. An avid reader with a active imagination. He loves to dress up and role play. Involved in musical theater, always landing lead parts. Always very concerned with the emotional needs of others, but has a hard time focusing on one person if there's a lot of other people around. In conversation he can be buoyant, witty, loud, quick, energetic, and fun, but he can also be quiet and gentle. He's not afraid to hug people, especially cuddly with his family members, and he makes friends effortlessly because everyone wants to be near him. As a kid he was a loner and was intimidated by people. He spent most of his time in the woods by himself running around barefoot, reading, and building model planes. He still does this actually, and still is barefoot most of the time. We call him a Hobbit, which suits him well. He's the most richly alive person I've ever met... I think that's why I'm having a hard time typing him."
"An e-friend typed me ISFP because of my NASCAR poems (they look like an Intuitive Sensor thing, a Sensing interest combined with and Intuitive thing, as sports are an S interest and poetry's more likely to be an N interest) and my stories online she's read, but someone thought I had INFP writing on Quora and another Quoran thought I seemed Si-dom there.  So, what are your signs someone's not an ISFP?  Like what are things that someone does/doesn't do that make them not ISFP in your eyes?"
"So, what's your favorite animal? 

I have 2 favorites, Owls and Sheep. 

Your turn."
"I'm an ENTP girl and recently I have a crush on an ISFP boy. We are in the same class and to me, we act like bf and gf, only we never proposed. I only got close to him since the start of 2023. We spent almost every recess and lunch together, and we enjoy each others' presence. He comes to my seat pretty often in the mornings before classes start (He used to start sleeping from the instance he gets to his seat) and I go to him every recess. 

At first, we just seemed like normal school friends, chatting and making fun of each other, but somehow I grew to stick with him and making physical touches like touching his hair or his face. At first, he stared at me and told me not to do it but now, I can touch him everytime I want. Also, he seems to be flirting with me as he never stays half as close with any other girls. He even kneeled down by my side and put his head on my desk once!!!🙈🙈🙈 And he helped me cool down once in a school outing by putting his iced coffee on my face (obviously not to shock me but to help me cool down) and when I lent him his fan, he adjusted the angle by moving my hand directly. When he refused to stand and continued walking, I gave him my hand and he took it and got up. Also, we stuck together throughout the day and even when I moved to the front, he followed.

I'm not very good at reading people's mind but I guess he at least has some interest or feelings for me? I proposed to him but got rejected as he said he couldn't get into an intimate relationship right now, but we still stick together every day after this. 

Can I believe that he likes me as well? And should I wait for him to reciprocate? Many thanks ❤"
"As an INFP, I know an ISFP that is just super flightly, more to do with who they are and not so much their type. But they are so conflict adverse and scretive that it gets annoying even talking to them. Anyway one is mad at me now for thinking I did something I didn't do, and I wonder how they handle anger.

I've read it's somewhat ragey, like a teenage temper tantrum. And that according to the 4 sides of the mind, they tend to rely on other's opinion and advice while in difficult situations. Is that relatable to you?"
"First of all, I'm an INTJ female. I have never had a relationship with an ISFP and to my awareness don't have any friends who are ISFP. However, I'm in the beginning stages of getting to know a guy who is ISFP. We have been talking for 2 weeks so it is super new. We hung out alone for the 1st time the other night and I know he's interested in me. I haven't heard from him since but he hearted a response I put on his wall the next day. My sense is that he is a bit scared but is interested and that in time he'll emerge from the cave that he went back into. Anyways, I'd appreciate any thoughts to help me understand ISFP's in relationships.

Thank you"
"Hello ISFPs! In this interview, I got a chance to talk to Sarah about what it's like to be an ISFP Fi-Se CP/S(B) FM. Sarah is the same personality type as Taylor Swift and she made some pretty funny comments about her celebrity type twin. We then talked about her life as an ISFP and not understanding how relationships work. Sarah also talked about her ExxJ swing and how in relationships, she would like to go straight to marriage instead of the ambiguous dating phase and be together all day with her partner. She said that she can be herself and love hearing out her friend's stories as long as they are in her Fi. Sarah also talked about being visual yet for her job, she works with scents and perfumes which uses her tester modality as opposed to her primary one. She said that using her visual feels more personal and commercializing it feels wrong. Sarah talked about her feminine Fi and double masculine NT blast last and how she would be crying while saying bad things to other people when a demon swing happens. We also talked about her life as an IxxP and wanting to be the best and be competitive. Sarah also talked about her masculine Ni and NF when she talks about having premonitions of things that will happen between her and another person and those projections actually happening for real. Finally, we talked about how she got into personality types and how she thinks tarot and horoscope is bullshit and MBTI and OPS seemed more factually true hence why she decided to invest her time and energy to learn this system so she can improve herself and work on being better at using her NT blast last. Watch this interview here:"
"Hi,

I've taken the Autism Quotient Test at least a dozen times (which, admittedly, is not a substitute for getting assessed by a professional), and I've always tested positive for Asperger's (like, way above the cutoff).  My few friends assure me I'm not Aspergian (that's a real word, I think) and I even went to a crappy psychologist who flipped through a little book and told me, after hemming and hawing for five seconds, that I don't have Asperger's.  I'm wondering though if any of you ISFP's have run into this (i.e. testing positive for Asperger's)?  I'd think ISFP would be one of the primary personality configurations who'd test positive for Asperger's.  

In case you've never taken the test and would like to, links to the test are below (the first link wasn't working for me today, but it's the one I usually take).

"I might sound like any teenager in the world (though I'm 21) but is it anyone else that always, always, has this feeling of being alone in this world? I mean, I have a wonderful family and a few friends that are awesome, but I constantly have a feeling of having no one to relate to. I feel alone in a crowd of people, and the dream is to find a person that just.. understands it all. But it's like there's a distance between me and everyone else. It's like I'm in a bubble. I don't know if it's me being mental or if it's an ISFP thing.. I just feel like I can't connect with people all the way and like I'm on a different level than everyone else. It's horrible, and hard to explain, but is there anyone here who knows what I'm talking about?"
"I don't know how to express this clearly, but I've heard ISFPs often describe themselves as feeling""different"" from other people; unique, spacey, weird, daydreamy, and others. So my questions are, what specific kinds of situations prompt that feeling? Why? How often do you feel that way? Did you ever mistype yourself as an N because of feeling unique? 

Thanks for your insight. I'm still trying to understand you guys."
"Hello everybody!
So I recently met a guy who I'm pretty sure is an Isfp (the Se and Fi is strong with this one)
We started seeing each other 2 months ago and getting intimate so naturally I'm growing fond of him. My friend is telling me to ask him where he stands on our relationship but i've never really had that 'what are we' talk in the past. It just naturally developed into a serious relationship. HOWEVER the difference here is that 'he's traveling the world to find himself' and told me that his plan was to spend another 6 months here and then he'll go to another destination. But he wants to settle down someplace after that.
Because there is already an expiration date on our relationship I pretty much assume he's not going for something serious but my friend (a hopeless romantic person I adore) is pushing me to ask anyways cause a lot can change in a few months and a very similar situation happened to a friend of ours. She was seeing a guy casually for a few months she moved back to her country, he followed her six years ago, they're still together. Some people are lucky I guess. To be honest even asking if he's seeing other people is hard. He hasn't asked either but I'm not because when I like someone I become blind to anyone else.

SO my question is : how do I address the topic with him considering I am an emotionally constipated Fi user. Honestly I'm anxious that this was obvious for him that he's not staying long -> even if he likes me he doesn't want to get attached -> he's not changing his plan. Would you assume the same thing in his position ?
I'm getting ready for rejection but I don't like feeling stupid.


Just a (maybe irrelevant thought) :
I gathered that isfp (and some people regardless of mbti type) are not fond of texting. I'm not either so I don't see this as a sign of disinterest. Plus, he's busy so I told him it's ok if he doesn't feel like talking or if he forgets to answer. He seemed to really appreciate that comment. However I know some people in the past thought I was indifferent to them cause I didn't spam them with texts. Just a thought but he could be thinking that my texting pattern are an indicator that I'm looking for something casual and not serious.


Thanks in advance !"
"Basically, there’s this ISFP dude in my class that sits next to me. We don’t know each other and we had just enrolled into the same lecture by chance. One day, while we were writing down notes, I caught the dude sneaking looks on my paper to copy off, but I let it slide because I didn’t really want to give him the cold shoulder.

After a few rounds of that, now I was the one who lost concentration and couldn’t write down some stuff, so I opened my book to see what I missed out on, but he tapped my arm and showed me his writing. I was really grateful of that and I appreciated it a lot, so I wanted to be closer with him.

But no matter WHAT I say, it always ends there! I tried to make conversation by asking him his mbti type, and it ended there lol, and another time I caught him spinning his pen, so I couldn’t help it and blurted that it was really cool how he did that. I don’t think he even replied. I remember he didn’t even meet my eyes though. He looked straight ahead like I wasn’t there.

So I decided to ask if he had a social @, and he responded if I wanted to know it, and then I said yes and told him to write it down. That’s pretty much the only conversation we had that lasted longer than ten seconds.

I don’t know why he won’t look at me in the eye. Maybe he’s just shy around everyone. He did occasionally lean towards me to look at my writing to check if he wrote things right. That’s pretty much it.

I know I’m being really, really, petty, and I’m sorry in advance, but is he not willing to talk to me? I felt a little uneasy because I wondered if I was making him uncomfortable."
"Post your song here 🤘🏽
I’ll start.



Do you like this song?"
"Sometimes I learn something about the world, some new connection.
It links up in a way that makes it feel I've leveled up.
It usually happens when I explore some new system of knowledge and I realize how it connects to something I already understand.
It is like the floodgates are opened and I feel like a god or something.










I know this is a perfect example of Jungian inflation where my weak Ni gets overconfident and think I'm smarter than anyone else.
Still I'm actually smarter as a byproduct of the realization, it really did level me up, but I overestimate how much smarter I got.
I've found that a good way to get my feet on the ground is trying to write the knowledge down in some document.
Forcing myself to try to Te out the insight really shows me how weak a grip I have on it.
It also makes me better at the thing I leveled up in, so it is all good, even if my ego feels fully deflated.

Anyone else can relate to some of this?"
"I am certain without a doubt I am an xSFP personality type but I am not sure if I am ESFP or ISFP. I will describe myself and hobbies etc and maybe it can help create a more accurate picture of which type I lean more towards. I understand they both use the same functions, just slightly different orders.

I am very passionate about music. I am a songwriter and record music myself and it is by far my favorite way I express myself to the world. Songs can move me deep inside instantly and I can listen to a song on repeat over and over. I know whether I like something right away. I connect to the overall feel. I tend to like moody indie folk/pop type music but my taste is very eclectic.

I love nature and anything being surrounded in dramatic landscapes. The forest, coastline, mountains, and open countryside bring me so much peace and happiness. It’s like I am totally rejuvenated after being in those environments. I am highly affected by lighting and sensitive to changes in the immediate environment. I am captivated by sunsets.

I love going for drives or riding my motorcycle. Something about it just grounds me and helps me feel relaxed and at ease in the world. It also allows me to see new sights and take time to reflect which I love!

I do enjoy people but I spend a significant time alone, not always by choice but by the nature of my lifestyle and job etc. I am very independent by nature, and do most things alone. Something I have always enjoyed doing is people watching. I love to analyze what is happening around me.

I am very passionate with my beliefs and values. If I see someone either violating those, or not respecting mine, it is an instant turn off for me and I do not have any desire to create connection with that person any longer. I am a huge advocate for treating others with kindness and compassion, and listening to others and validating their opinions and beliefs regardless if ours don’t align.

That being said, I can be very outgoing and life of the party in some situations especially with close friends or family, but also very quiet and reflective too depending on the mood I am in. When there is too much stimuli around me, I can get rather frazzled and overloaded. I am sensitive to energy around me.

This is me in a nutshell! Let me know what you think!"
"Soo a couple years ago when my ENTJ friend sent me to take a personality type quiz after I was complaining to her about my job, I found out I was an ISFP.

Later on, I decided to take the test again, and I got INFP. Then did it again and got ISFP.. this test gave a percentage of each and I think I wasn't too much more Se, but was just by a little. This did make me question myself and who I fit under, but for sure I am a more creative, artsy person so I could say I am definitely ISFP.

Then the question of intuition has been coming into my mind, especially lately. Id say over the past couple years I've become more intuitive, thinking of the future, trying to plan and set goals. I also didn't understand how I could be Se dominant if I actually do think I tend to be intuitive.

THEN I came across this article a few weeks ago, which says that our #2 function is extroverted sensing, and #3 is introverted intuition. It then says that we are quite balanced in our Se and Ni, even through Ni is #3. This was like an aha! moment for me. I more started to question it because I recently also came across the idea of Highly Sensitive People, and I thought that I was one. I bought a book called ""The Highly Sensitive Person"" and started to read it. I just started, but in the first chapter it talks about how HSP are very intuitive people. So I thought to myself, if I am considered ""Se"", then how can fit as an intuitive HSP. well now I think its a little more clear to me. I looked quickly into the number of ISFP's that are considered HSP, and it seems to be a low % compared to other iNtuitive personality types. 

Id like to get some insight from my other ISFP's. Do any of you consider yourself to be Highly Sensitive? Also, do you consider yourself to have a good dose of Ni, where it can be balanced with your Se? 

Im new to diving more into personality types and HSP, so any insight would be great. I also just started reading the book so I have no idea what else is in here. I guess I just thought that all ISFPs would be like me, highly sensitive lol. This is interesting to me. I am not the number one fan of labels in general, but these have helped me to understand myself better and why things have affected my life."
Would a relationship between two ISFPs work? Why or why not?
"Hello isfps, I'm here to ask a question on the cognitive functions stacking of your type because I'm going through a typing crisis.
I've typed myself as isfp for a long time, but I've started to have doubts mainly because of two functions: Se and Te.

As for Se, the problem is that my Se seems to be nonexistent. I don't live in the present but rather in my own head, I'm not really spontaneous and can't ""live in the moment"", and when I try to do that (which is usually when I'm drunk, as I find it hard to let myself go otherwise) it ends up being a mess and chaotic more than anything else.
The problem with Te is that it seems to work better than my Se. I'm not the type of person to plan every little thing, but at the same time I'm no airhead who can't get things done. I can indeed be organized and efficient when I need to be (I was described as a ""war machine"" on my job, which is in the research field for context), because as long as I can do things my own way, I have no problem with deadlines and time management and all that stuff. I like to have a general plan for my day just to have a general idea of where I'm going while still keeping it flexible; nor am I extremely emotional to the point of not being able to hold back judgement when I need to, I know when it is the moment to express myself and when I need to shut up.

I also don't really see myself in inferior Te problems... And a Fi-Ni loop makes no sense because I've been like this my whole life and not just for some period of time.

The only thing I'm sure about is that Ni and Fi and my highest functions and everything else around that makes no sense.
Do any of you isfps relate to this, and/or have an explanation?

I don't know if it can help or influence anything, but in enneagram I'm a 4w5 (415 or 451) so/sx."
"As already pointed out in another forum, these should not be viewed to determine one's type, but for information purposes only. Whether you agree with Susan Storm's assessments or not, should not influence any from determining their best fit type as being ISFP.

#1 – You’re Extremely Down to Earth

You take life as it comes and, according to typologists Paul D. Tieger and Barbara Barron-Tieger, “are the most unassuming and down-to-earth of all types.” (p. 49, The Art of Speed-Reading People). You are very aware of the facts of life, and the reality of what is happening around you. Not much can rattle you because you tend to have a very grounded outlook.

#2 – You Show Your Affection Through Actions More Than Words

You’re typically not someone to verbalize a bunch of effusive praises to the people you love. Rather than whispering sweet nothings, you’re more likely to shovel someone’s snow or make them a mixtape. Your feelings, although deep, are very private and internally felt. You tend to show your affection and love through acts of service and helpful gestures more than words of admiration.

#3 – You Are Deeply Affected by the Pain or Misfortune of Others

Although you may seem mysterious and even stoic on the outside, you are deeply feeling on the inside. You are tremendously affected by the pain, unhappiness, or trauma of others. You instantly imagine how it must feel to be in their shoes. This empathy tends to grow as you age and mature. You might find yourself feeling intensely troubled, sensing a deep pain in your heart and a lump in your throat as you hear about the afflictions that others have experienced.

#4 – You Take a While to Get to Know

You’re not someone who immediately wears your heart on your sleeve. You need to know that you can trust someone before you share your true feelings, your pain, or your tough experiences in life. Highly effusive, expressive people can be overwhelming to you and if they ask for a lot of details about your life it can make you feel anxious or even suspicious.

#5 – You Quickly Notice What Other People Need

Because you are so observant and attentive to details, you are quick to notice when the people around you seem worried, stressed, cold, or uncomfortable in any way. You’re probably one of the first to offer a warm blanket to someone who is cold, or the first to go snuggle a pet that seems lonely or anxious for friendship.

#6 – You Try to Hold Space for People’s Unique Differences

It’s crucial to you to be open-minded to the experiences and worldviews of others. While you hold strictly to your own beliefs, you also realize that everyone else is shaped by their unique life experiences. You tend to be quietly accepting of others unless they are sharing beliefs that are condescending or harsh to your personal values.

#7 – Managing Long-Range Projects Leaves You Overwhelmed

Because you’re more focused on the present than the future, it can be challenging for you to imagine how things are likely to play out. Projects that take a lot of focused, methodical attention and have a distant payout tend to be frustrating to you. You like to get quick results and see an immediate result from what you are putting your energy into now.

#8 – You Are Suspicious of Sugarcoating and Overly-Effusive Behavior

Some people believe that feeling types want all their words wrapped up in words of praise, affirmation, or compliments. For ISFPs, this can actually be off-putting. These types like people who are straightforward and real with them. Authenticity and direct honesty are more important to them than cloying, sentimental words.

#9 – You Have a Lot of Aesthetic Sense

You notice the world around you in high-definition detail. Details stand out. Blue isn’t just blue, it’s Sapphire or Egyptian Blue or Azure. You notice what colors complement each other and enjoy perusing art museums or looking at different fashions to see which style best resembles you as an individual. To you, colors, designs, clothing – all of it can exemplify a part of your unique personality in a way that words just can’t define.

#10 – You Crave Creative Freedom

You enjoy toying with creative supplies and materials to come up with something completely unique. You enjoy careers that allow you to be creative, whether that’s through photography, marketing, cooking, hairstyling, performing, or many other avenues.

#11 – You Hate Being Rushed

You weigh decisions for longer than most people, trying to understand the significance or value of each option in-depth. When people pressure you to make up your mind quickly, you feel irritable and resentful.

#12 – You Empathize with the Underdog

You are particularly drawn to oddballs, misfits, and misunderstood or marginalized people. Because of your individualistic nature, you appreciate people who march to the beat of their own drum.

#13 – You’re a Closeted Adrenaline Junkie

Sure, you enjoy binge-watching Netflix and laboring over a creative project. But there’s also a side of you that is hungry for physical intensity and thrilling action. Whether you’re rock climbing, dancing, or speeding past a slow driver – you enjoy pushing yourself physically and getting a rush of independence and freedom as a result.

#14 – You Help People See Options

You have an eye for opportunities in the present moment, and you help people find resources and alternatives they may not have considered previously. You tend to stay calm in a crisis and help people find creative ways out of difficult situations.

#15 – You’re Drawn to the Mysterious

You enjoy spending time alone and imagining how the future could unfold. Conceptualizing new ways of seeing things can be very stimulating and energizing for you. At the same time, you tend to distrust yourself when it comes to guessing how something will happen in the distant future. When you’re being creative your intuition really does shine! You enjoy doing creative projects where you can draw attention to mysterious or symbolic meanings.

#16 – You Hate Rigid Rules and Structures

You like being flexible and adapting to the needs of the moment rather than being stuck with guidelines that tie you down. You feel like life is unpredictable, and as a result, it’s better to be able to go with the flow rather than check-in with your schedule to make sure everything is running according to a strict plan.

#17 – You Dislike Giving Negative Feedback

Critiquing people is something that tends to send shivers up your spine. You like to create an atmosphere of openness and quiet warmth, not an atmosphere of defensiveness and shame. Because of this, you tend to put off giving criticism or give it as gently as humanly possible.

#18 – You Think Better When You’re Surrounded by Beauty

Sitting in a stale cubicle is probably one of the worst ways for you to hand in your best work. Your creativity and focus blossom when you are surrounded by lush colors or ethereal landscapes. You often work well outdoors, in the wilderness, or in an area that you’ve made your own with beautiful details that inspire you.

#19 – You Crave Independence

Nothing fills you with more joy than venturing out on your own to do something meaningful. Stepping onto an airplane, roaming around in your car, or taking a risk on a career that aligns with your values (even if it dismays your more traditional parents) fills you with a sense of purpose and peace. You don’t like being tied down to someone else’s dreams, rules, or demands.

#20 – You Enjoy Binge-Watching Netflix When You’re Stressed

Okay, a lot of people do this, but your type especially enjoys television as a stress-reliever (according to the MBTI® Manual). When you’ve had a bad day, you enjoy piling up some comfy pillows and blankets, gathering your favorite snacks, and having a marathon of your favorite shows.

#21 – Speaking of Stress, You Become More Critical When You’re Burned Out

Normally gentle and tolerant, when you’re severely stressed, your personality can change unexpectedly. You might blurt out sarcastic or critical comments at people who are bothering you or get caught up in rage-fueled fantasies. Often you feel like everyone else is being lazy, inefficient, or incompetent. You can find out more about your stress reaction here.

#22 – Schedules Feel Confining

For you, bedtime is “when you’re tired,” and mealtime is “when you’re hungry.” You follow your instincts as you go through your day rather than structuring everything out. Family rituals where you have to rush through plans and schedules with a lot of other people tend to exhaust you.

#23 – You Don’t Want to Control Others

You hate the idea of invading anyone’s space – whether it be a human or an animal. Your “live and let live” mentality makes you a go-to friend for people who need space and freedom. You believe that every entity on this planet deserves personal freedom, respect, and a sense that their life is their own road to trailblaze.

#24 – Later in Life You Find More Satisfaction in Order

If you’re in your 50s or 60s, you’ve probably reached a point where you can organize your tasks and projects more easily. It’s easy for you to lay out reasonable explanations for things and you can argue your points with veracity. When you were younger, this was much more difficult for you."
