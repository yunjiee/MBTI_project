"Recently, I've had a lot of shit I've wanted to say here, but none of it really warrants it's very own thread. 

So think of this as a 'ISTPs spouting random bull' thread, say one, say twenty. All types are welcome.  

*Ahem*

1) When I was younger (and still quite a bit now) I would deal with my constant sense of loneliness by escaping to my own fantasy world, most things were the same but whatever need I had was filled in some weird, analogous way. I still don't know if that's me channeling my inner INTP's Ne or if it's because I'm one sandwich short of a picnic. 

2) I find replying to facebook events almost impossible. I don't know... there's something constricting about committing to something in a way in which other people can see... eurgh. 

3) Sometimes I think my only friend in the world is my pet bird; at least, he's the only thing which is reliably happy to see me. Animals > people. Period. 

4) I envy some other ISTPs ability to tell people what they really think of them; I guess I also envy most other ISTPs that have better Se than me. 

5) My favorite time of day is the night, namely when everyone else has gone to bed and I'm still awake. I love the silence, it really helps me to focus. I also like scuba diving for much the same reason. 

6) Sometimes I wonder if I'm missing a point by not really bothering with finding someone to be in a relationship with... idk, I just look at people in relationships and wonder if feigning interest in someone I know I wouldn't have any long term potential with in exchange for intimate companionship is worth it. I wonder until I realize that in order to find someone to be in a relationship with that would mean having to get up and talk to people... back to screwing around on personality forums making asinine threads then."
"Okay...I stole from the ISFPs who stole it from ISTJs who stole it from INFPs.

Post pics of things you like that are ISTP related.

What ISTP wouldn't like to be alone and far away?









Every ISTP has their car/bike/engine powered thing of choice...I happen to like Volvo C30's and Yamaha XT250's"
"We all know what the stereotypical ISTP female would look like: robot, butch, skulking about, etc. Let's put a rest to this A.I. nonsense. If you're female and an ISTP, post a picture of yourself so we can see what you look like.

I am an ISTP woman, and I'm extremely curious to see how many ISTP females on here there are. I think our type+gender would be pretty hard to find. :blushed:

"Hi. I'm new to PerC but have been messing around on forums for a long time. Anyway, I noticed that there wasn't a thread for new members to introduce themselves (unless I am very much mistaken), so I decided to make one. 

Thus; I am 19 years old and live on the east coast of Australia with my parents. I am currently readying myself for 80 days of basic military training over the next few months at a barracks down south. I like hip hop and I am not black. (Not that being of any particular racial complexion is a bad thing in any way)

Any questions?:laughing:

GT: Styglmah"
"Okay, I'm not one, but I'm married to one and I find them intriguing  and am curious what kind of lists you all would come up with and how much it would match him and the (few) other ISTPs I know."
I found it somewhere. Idk if it's taken seriously or not
"As the title says. Enneagram 5 vs 8 in the ISTP. The more ive thought abut this, the more ive seen too many commonalities between the two. Because of this, ive found it hard to type myself. So id like to ask all of you a few questions: 

Which is more common in your opinion?
(On this i will likely counter argue)

How would you distinguish between the two?

And how has your view on this changed over time?"
"My ISTP ex-husband and I (INTP) live in different countries. When we got divorced he said that we would keep in touch and I asked if I could visit him.
We haven’t been in touch as much as I would like.
When I asked if he was still of the same opinion about me visiting he replied saying that those things might be more complicated than just say yes or no.
So I’m guessing he is unsure of what he wants.
What would be your advice on how we could figure out what is best for us?"
I have an ISTP villain on a Harry Potter roleplay. How does the type of ISTP effect the character's actions as a bad guy?
"How ISTP would deal with being themselves and its consequences in front of their dates and S.O.? 

Like not being worried about what their parents would think and feeling relaxed in doing acts not normally seen as polite, like cursing (not to them), expressing their inner anti-social thoughts, being messy, etc. 

In brief: during a romantic relationship 
would you watch your behavior often if not consistently; or be relaxed and act as you would when by yourself? 

And how would you deal with the consequences of being yourself?"
"As you all know by now, being an ISTP has some drawbacks.  One of those happens to be in dealing with others.

We don't play well with others.

Anyway, I've noticed we don't whine very much.  And if we do, it's usually at the inability to solve a problem, being overwhelmed, the stress that comes with daily life, etc.  It does not, however, come from a sense of ""entitlement"" like most other people.  We often hold our heads up high with anticipation with what's to come; with a steely resolve that is absent in most people.

So...what happens in turn?

People dump their cry-baby bullshit on us.  For years, I thought I was holding auditions for Baby Mario, fer God's sake.

Whaaaa!  Whaaaaa!  Whaaaaaaaa!

And well...you know...it's me.  I don't know--maybe I'm weird or something, but I did the conventional thing and tried to comfort people like the TV told me to do, or be nice to them or whatever you're supposed to do when somebody is shamelessly fishing for cheap attention.

You know that scene in Inglourious Basterds where Brad Pitt uncomfortably imitates an Italian director and can't even get past the thick hillbilly accent?

There's your analogy for me and comforting others.

Thoughts on this?"
"makes my blood boil, why the hell people don't just say what they mean"
"I'm not being stereotypical with this question. Let's be real for a moment though, Ti-Se-Ni does like to tinker with stuff applying that Ti towards something tangible like a homegrown MacGyver. When it's developed that way of course.

My neighbor was wanting to borrow a tool, I went ahead and let him use my multi tool pliers. I knew that in doing so might not of been a good idea, especially since he lacks in actually fixing something.
I figured he would more than likely need yet another tool so I just handed him the multi tool. Mostly so he wouldn't keep asking for this and that, ya' know.

Since my neighbor is one of those types who thinks borrowing equals he owns it
The next day after he was done messing with his bike, I mentioned do you have the pliers that's my favorite tool for little things around the apartment. Toss it in drawer and later bam that cabinet door knob is loose no more.

He starts looking for it I'm telling him it's alright I'll just get it later. He finally finds it in the bag on the bike.
Well, one side of the needle nose pliers was bent enough where you can put a nut between the hole. The tension was shot, not worth messing with. He of course automatically started saying I didn't do it blah blah blah.
I ended giving him the set. Are you sure I thought this was your favorite one, he said. I told him yeah it was you can have it now though.

My question how pissed off would that make you?
I know i know, you wouldn't of let someone borrow your favorite tool anyway.
To be fair it was just a cheap one and I do have a small one also."
"So I got to thinking that there are a lot of superficial similarities. I find that when I casually try to type someone in my head, I have a difficult time with telling the difference. Although the differences are significant, do you think it's possible for INTJs and ISTPs to mistype themselves? If so, why?"
"There is a lot out there about INTPs and mathematics, but not really ISTPs. Would you, in general, say you are good at math? What aspects of math are you good at specifically, and what kinds of math are your favorite/strongest (i.e. trig, calculus, statistics)?"
"I'll leave it with you to figure out which one is which, lol."
"Do ISTPs ever enjoy abstract conversations? I've been married to an ISTP for a relatively long time and I'm slowly starting to believe I'm never going to be content with his mental abilities. I don't meet other people that often and I'm hoping to get some perspective in this, because I can no longer say if I'm being unreasonable or if my husband really is a little bit ""thick"" is some way. 

An example of our conversation could go something like this: 

Me: Do you believe in God?
He: No, of course not, it would be stupid. 
Me: But you have told me that you sometimes pray when you are afraid. 
He: Yeah, that's true. 
Then his mind turns elsewhere and there's a long pause.
Me: So, do you believe in God or not?
He: No.
Me: Why? 
He: Because it's stupid. 

Another (imaginary but true enough) example.

Me: I had a dream about X trying to harm me. 
He: What happened?
Me: *tells* I wonder why I always dream about that thing. It must have something to do with X.
He: *pets my head*
Me: So what do you think?
He: Must feel bad to have those dreams.
Me: Not really, they are just dreams. What do you think about my theory?
He: I think you should find some solution so that you no longer have to worry about X.
Me: Ok, but what about the theory?
He: Hmmm... 
Long pause.
He: Do you think we should do B today?
Me: The dream!
He: Oh right, wouldn't it be cool if X could freeze his disk and use it like a hammer?

He seems to be unable to deal with abstract opinions or thoughts. In the latter example he thinks I need emotional comfort so he tries to solve that by petting me. He sucks at empathy so I hardly ever expect anything from him on that part anyway, and I rarely want to talk about my feelings. Instead I see an interesting phenomenon that could be discussed on general level. I've told him all this a thousand times but he always behaves the same way. I've even tried to state beforehand that I am now theorizing, not seeking empathy. It doesn't help. 

So, is abstract discussion something ISTPs can't generally get at all? Are there any tricks that could help me get him open up about his thoughts? He says he would like to be able to have good conversations with me but he hasn't put any effort into learning how."
"So I’ve been listening to The Browning for many years now.  They are a electro metal band, not everyone likes that type of *cough cough singing, I get that.  It is a death growl, but the more I listen to it the more I’m getting an ISTP vibe.  Here is one song, but literally you can listen to any of their music and I get the same vibe.  I chose this one because it has the words in the video.  Anyone hear that too, or am I listening to it with my ISTP filter?"

The Unhealthy ISTP (Understanding the ISTP Dark Side)

Innovation, independence, and decisiveness. These are appropriate words to describe an ISTP. What about an unhealthy ISTP? Can they be described in the same manner? If you’ve been thinking about this, I have good news. This article will discuss it in closer detail.

Who is the Unhealthy ISTP?

An unhealthy ISTP is an ISTP who displays traits that are wide of their true character. Sometimes, these traits might be an extreme version of their usual traits or a new one altogether. There are many reasons why an ISTP can become unhealthy. Some of them include failed expectations and loss of their job or partner. When an ISTP becomes unhealthy, people around will notice. If you’re an ISTP, the best way to avoid slipping into that situation is to know the signs of an unhealthy ISTP. It’s also important to know that experiencing one of these signs does not necessarily signal unhealthiness.

Signs of an Unhealthy ISTP

1. Extremely Arrogant

ISTPs are smart but not arrogant. Because they are introverts, they usually are more reserved and fun. Unhealthy ISTPs are different. Arrogant oozes through them. Now, everyone can be arrogant. However, they take it too far. For example, unhealthy ISTPs might believe they are always right and look down on others. These are all done openly and might make them unlikeable. These are not normal traits of an ISTP.

2. Unproductive

Unhealthy ISTPs are complacent and lazy. Their extroverted sensing function combines with their perceiving function to create this problem. Thus, unhealthy ISTPs are serial procrastinators. In the long term, this might make them miss life-changing opportunities.

3. Withdraws Completely

ISTPs are introverts. So, it’s normal if they are a bit withdrawn. Unhealthy ISTPs will take this to an extreme. They might isolate themselves from society and their friends. Some might become paranoid, thinking everyone is out to get them. Their withdrawals can quickly deteriorate into other issues like depression.

4. Much More Aggressive

Unhealthy ISTPs are more aggressive. While physicality is a big way they show their aggressiveness, verbal cues, and body gestures are also high on that list. Unhealthy ISTPs might also have a temper. Backed by their Se function, they might enjoy violence and fighting. Because they are thinkers, becoming ruthless is a real possibility.

5. Looks a lot like an underdeveloped INTP

Unhealthy ISTPs are a lot like underdeveloped INTP. One way is their view of rules and norms. Unhealthy ISTPs find ways to bend even the most sensible rules. They become obsessed with independence and feel these norms are out to control them. They might also dress really poorly and care less about their appearance.

6. Extremely Impulsive

Perceivers generally struggle more with being impulsive. Unhealthy ISTPs are the worst hit. They are more reckless and might make decisions on a whim. This can lead to serious problems with their finances and career.

7. Serious Communication Issues

Unhealthy ISTPs will struggle with communication for several reasons. First, they become less sensitive to people’s concerns and needs. This also includes what they say. Thus, unhealthy ISTPs will listen less when people talk. They also have other traits, such as paranoia and anger. These two traits make communication intimidating or frustrating.

How to Get Out of the ISTP Dark Side

Do you believe you are an unhealthy ISTP? Here are some ways to avoid or get out of the ISTP dark side.

1. Learn More About Yourself

That’s why you’re here. Learning more about yourself helps you in many ways. First, it opens the door to self-improvement. It also helps you to identify triggers and work on them. The MBTI and enneagram are great places to start. If you don’t know your type yet, you should research the various MBTI and enneagram types. There are a lot of articles on ISTPs right here on this website. That’s a good place to start.

2. Self-care

It’s always a good idea to practice self-care. As stated earlier, unhealthiness usually develops when there’s stress or pressure. Giving yourself time to recuperate is essential. ISTPs practice self-care by doing the things they love. So, take out time to do these things. Here’s an article that discusses self-care for all MBTI types.

3. Develop Your Extroverted Feeling Function

Many things might change for an unhealthy ISTP if their Fe was a bit more developed. They’ll care more about others and the harmony of their family or group. Developing your Fe is a good way to reduce your level of unhealthiness. However, it takes time and conscious effort to pull it off.

4. See a Therapist

If everything fails, seeing a therapist might be your best bet. They are trained to help you deal with these sorts of problems. While this is true, ensure you’re comfortable with it before diving in. There are now options for online therapies. So, you can explore that option if it appeals to you.

Commonly Asked Questions About the Unhealthy ISTP

What is a Healthy ISTP Personality?

A healthy ISTP personality displays the normal traits of an ISTP. This does not mean that a healthy ISTP must be a stereotypical ISTP. However, the absence of extreme traits is a good sign of healthiness.

What do ISTPs Struggle With?

ISTPs might find it harder to look at the bigger picture. This can lead to struggles in business projects. They might lack the patience to follow through when there’s little progress."
"Long story short, I have a good friend who I've always typed as an ISFP. One day I made him do the MBTI test (two separate ones) and he came up with ISTP. I was rather surprised, since I know they are very different from each other. 

I have ISTP friends, and they fit into the introverted, rather cold and detached ISTP stereotype. I used to have an ISTP best friend who shows his affection by being available to hang out, do things together, and help me in practical ways.

I also have ISFP friends (although not so close) so I know the general air of ISFPs pretty well.

However I am unsure in this friend of mine - did I mistype him or did he mistype himself?
He's

-pretty friendly and outgoing (the ISTPs I know only hang out with certain people, and ISFPs are more welcoming toward strangers)
-rather goofy around friends (ISTPs I know are a lot more terse and solemn although they do crack jokes)
-likes to help people out whenever he can (even possibly sacrificing some important things)
-easily expresses emotions to close friends and especially romantic partners (he's very vocal with love expressions and even PDAs with a romantic partner)
-actually cries at sad movie scenes, and is often touched 
-peace-loving and rather soft-hearted
-low self-esteem, especially in relationships (ISTPs I know have higher self-esteem than ISFPs)

He could be an ISTP - he stays away from physical contact except with romantically interested people, he's really good at technical things and solving technical problems. He's not much good at dealing with people, and he's not so good intuiting what certain emotions mean (he can't read people well) but he tries his best to understand (possibly in a logical way) and is open to conversations if it can fix a problem (people or machines).
I've seen ISTPs not wanting attention and stick at a corner but will offer to lead if nobody wants to or throw themselves into the limelight just so they can offer solutions. He doesn't like to take charge, but will do so if he's being given the role without being asked. 

I've read somewhere that an ISFP is more avoidant of problem-solving, to quote it ""he will often not want to explain his thoughts clearly and coherently, then hang up on you if the conversation doesn't go his way."" because they're over-sensitive about feelings and also because they're Fi. He's not like that, in fact he's always eager to solve problems and likes to have ""talks"". 
Also, ISFPs are more indecisive (even on life goals and important decisions) than ISTPs, and in this case he's less wishy-washy, and is often on the lookout for greener grass even though he's pretty satisfied with life. 

I guess I'm just confused about the part where he is more emotional and altruistic than ISTPs I know, which would point toward ISFP, but yet again, ISFP with their Fi aren't that altruistic anyway. I know ISTPs aren't robotic, but they aren't as..how do I put it...feely as this friend? However this is only during casual situations, during work where he needs to act professional he's almost 100% a stereotypical ISTP.

Thoughts?
Thanks"
"From what I've read, INTPs can sometimes suddenly act cold or be mean in order to test ""if the person can keep up with their quirks"" or that they'll really stay.

I was wondering if ISTPs ever do this as well. I'm still parsing through what happened with my relationship with my ISTP ex and he went hot/cold, jerkoff/upstanding gentleman and back again a couple times... It seemed the super cold and the super hot would both be sudden... i.e. ""Please don't go, you're the best"" to ""Get out, I don't have feelings from you"" and even months later I'm like... what? 

Also, do ISTPs think about old relationships at all? I resent the idea that I still think about it while he bounces around happily."
"For those who may be aware of Susan Storm's Psychology Junkie website, Ms. Storm and her colleague Denzel Mensah had a forum on what is introverted thinking and what is extraverted sensing. You may find you resonate with some of the information. 

Introverted Thinking
 Extraverted Sensing"
"Let me explain this, firstly. Romantic orientation and sexual orientation is not the same thing. I've noticed this in some bisexuals actually. For example, a bisexual is attracted to two genders but he only sees himself settling down with a woman. This would mean he is a heteroromantic bisexual. For most people, the romantic orientation does match the sexual orientation. Perhaps it is a female who is a heteroromantic heterosexual or a male homoromantic homoesexual. But it is possible to have all sorts of combinations.

Along with orientations that prefer certain genders or sexes, there are orientations that do not form attractions. These are denoted by the a- prefix, as in atheist. Asexual is an orientation where the person is not attracted sexually. Aromantic is an orientation where the person is not attracted romantically. 

Keep in mind that behavior is different from orientation. A person may be homosexual but has sex with people of the opposite gender. In the same way, an asexual may have sex with a person. 


So I was wondering if there are any asexuals, aromantics, or people who have different romantic orientations than what their sexual orientation is that visit this website. Or even if you suspect that you may be one. And what your personal experiences are. 

Personally, I am an aromantic heterosexual. Feel free to ask questions."
"ISTPs and INFPs. 
Stupid? Brilliant?
Makes zero sense?
Or it works?"
"Hi ISTPs. You seem so rational and non emotional. You also don't seem to react as much unless it's one of those few things important to you. It's hard to know whether there is a sea of emotions flowing regularly through you that is unvoiced, or if what you see is really what you get? Agree, disagree? Thoughts?"
"Has anyone here ever started their own successful business, and could share some insights? (Definition of success in this scenario would be making enough money to be self sufficient)

I have been thinking about starting my own business for a long time now. I know there would be particular struggles for the ISTP personality, but I feel like the pros would outweigh the cons.


PROS

-You are your own boss, which means nobody breathing down your neck and micro-managing you

-You get to choose the work you do and the clients you take on (within reason)

-You can make your own hours and take holidays when you like (this can be tricky if you start getting busy and have a backlog of work. However, given enough notice, I'm sure clients would understand. After all, everyone needs time away)

-You are in full control of the marketing, prices, accounting/bookkeeping, scope of work, etc

-When growing, you get to choose who to hire to work in your business

CONS

-No job security. Will be tough sledding until you get a few clients and find some momentum (some people aren't comfortable with this, but I think ISTP is well suited to this unpredictability)

-A lot of work hours (although most would see this as a con, I find this intriguing if you're doing meaningful work)

-liabilities that come with running a business (threat of being sued, bad customers, online complaints/bad reviews, etc)


I've worked in the Corporate world now for 10+yrs at several different companies, and I feel like it's mostly designed for extroverted types who can do endless amounts of people pleasing and managerial ass-kissing. The exception would be if you could specialize in one particular area and be the best at what you do. However, I have a thirst for various experiences and a dynamic, ever changing environment.


I have many more thoughts on the topic, and look forward to engaging with some of you humans on the matter!"
What would make an ISTP angry or abusive?
"Sounds like an unusual combination. I see most ISTPs with sp/so or sp/sx, but rarely one with sx as their dominant stacking. Just wanted to see if there are some ISTP sx/sp's. Post your enneagram if you know one. How does your combination manifest itself? How do the descriptions of ISTP fit you, what are the differences? Sx's are known for intensity in relationships, as opposed to Sp's survivability. Any comment on that?"
"This goes out to the ISTP Christians on this forum. 

I accepted Christ at age 6 and from the age of 11 to the present, I've been all over the place with Christianity. I'd go into detail, but I'm on my phone...if you need the details, I'll hop online later and give them.

I've reached a point now, where I truly desire to live according to God's Word. I believe Jesus is the only way I can be saved and I accept Him into my heart.

My problem lies in that, the deeper I think about Christianity, the more I wonder if my belief is true. Christians always ask the question, ""If you were to die tonight, are you 100% sure you'd go to Heaven?"" And when I think about it, I can't even picture Heaven. I can't see myself standing face to face with Jesus or standing before God in judgement. Heck, I can't even see myself dying.

I live so much in the moment, it's hard for me to grasp any past or future. And it's not like I believe anything else, like evolution, the big bang etc. I just can't honestly say I can grasp the concept/wrap my mind around God being out there watching me right, now.

So I'm stuck between belief and (doubt?)...it's really bothering me because I want to have a genuine belief, but I can't reason it into existence and I don't even know if the belief I have is false to begin with.

Also, when I get really involved with church, I almost feel like I'm in a dream or something. Like none of this is real and I'm just gonna wake up and go back to a normal life where all I'm concerned about is mechanics, thrill seeking and the thought of death never occurs to me. It's weird.

The more I think, the more confused I become.

I tried talking to the college Pastor at my church and he tried to help me, but he drew some blanks because my, ""thoughts were so deep"" I guess he didn't really look that deep into the topic before.

Also the Bible preaches, to keep your focus things of heaven, not on things of  the earth. And it preaches to follow it's scripture, but he more I focus on heaven and following scripture, I can't seem to function in day to day life anymore and I feel bogged down by rules and regulations.

I know (from what I've read and my own experience) we ISTP's tend to have trouble believing in things we can't see and looking into the future. How did you overcome this struggle and accept Christianity as a reality? Or did you even have this struggle?"
"Dear Brethren,

ever since I remember I have been battling procrastination and general laziness.

And it is a big problem, because I can learn/do anything I want... but don't really get anything done after I stop caring (which is rather quickly). It wastes time, cockblocks $$$ making and progress in general.

Personally, this quirk of mine drives me nuts. I waste so much time. I could do so much, but alas. Objectively, I find this to be my ""primary flaw,"" everything else can be figured out and learned (which is true!!!). 

So, dear ISTPs, let's hack this once and for all.

EXPAND THE SPOILER section to see collected relevant quotes from various sources (warning: long):


 








			Great believers in economy of effort, which is an asset if they judge accurately how much effort is needed, and do efficiently what the situation demands. If not, economy of effort can become mere laziness and little will get done.
		
Click to expand...

We are not lazy, we just don't think it's worth doing. Past inactivity becomes a bonus in crisis situation (energy reserve, senses ""ready""):



			According to the discussion here ( Dario Nardi's Neuroscience of Personality ) strong Se users seem to have brains that stay in a low-key idling mode as the default state but spring into action rapidly when a crisis is detected. So, not giving a shit is most likely how you're wired. Without that, you might not have the ability to be awesome in crisis situations.

ISTPs present a paradoxical picture.  They appear to be lazy (there's no other word for it!) but they are really energy-conservers:  constant activity does not appeal, per se.  Nor are they anti-activity.  They simply don't believe in getting involved in the ""non-essential"" or during  the ""non-essential stage"".  Of course, they are willing to define ""when"" that is for themselves or for others but not too willing to have that defined for them.
		
Click to expand...

Coping mechanism of sorts:



			Well procrastination is a great way to deal with stuff you don't want to do. Leaving it to the last minute ensures that you spend as little time on it as possible, which is ideal. You don't even feel yourself doing it because pressure and adrenaline take over.
		
Click to expand...

This is scarily accurate, primary problem I think:



			The ISTPs' area of interest will take precedence over assigned tasks that are perceived as dull, boring, or not practical. They can become so engrossed with their own projects that other obligations, if not abandoned outright or forgotten, take second place. In situations that excite them, they work with great accuracy and precision, often to the amazement and envy of others. They thrive on and prefer ""working on the edge,"" even putting themselves at risk, if that's what it takes to get the job done.

So in a nutshell, as others have said before, there is no cure for this mindset, and you can either give up, bullshit it, or find a way to learn the material (usually making a game or a challenge of it works) so that it can somehow appear less boring/useless. Or implement all three. Otherwise, when it comes to actually completing an assignment (whether I like it or not) as opposed to studying, I naturally slowly pretend I'm in jail. It works.

Fear/freaking out about something (=crisis of sort) motivates: 



			I used to care about winning more. Its more about pushing/ scaring the shit out of myself now.

			From another standpoint, I really can't be bothered to actually compete. If I see somebody being obviously better than what I am in some area, I make a point of not being in on the contest, which tends to upset those of my friends who actually are competitive.

Also, I'm very much of a ""Player versus Environment"" person: I love challenging myself, whether it's about pressing the envelope for my tires friction against asphalt or how well I can shoot using only the iron sights, or whatever. But as soon as other people join the challenge, I usually seem to lose interest.

Talking about Lance Armstrong:



			And this is the distinction between Lance and I – I get satisfaction out of winning or achieving a goal; he gets all his satisfaction out of preventing other people from winning.
It's not that I like winning, it's more I just hate losing.

We work in cycles, lopsided for inactivity:



			That's just me in information gathering mode...I can appear that way for minutes, hours, days, or even months...people misinterpret as being lazy or shy, but once the iron is hot or I'm confident in knowledge, I appear to be in a whirlwind or possessed...it's almost like 2 different people. I am completely focused on that goal. And once that task is complete, I become dormant again. Its periodic, it's cyclic...and I have been this way since I was a little kid.

I think we consider ourselves superior in a way (admit it, things are generally easy, even if hard).

			After a lifetime of procrastinating I came to the conclusion that it's largely due to an excessive confidence in my own abilities. I've seen how quickly and efficiently I can get things done, when the pressure is on. It's like, I don't even notice doing it because it happens so fast. And I like it that way, because I hate the feeling of ""work"".

Again, it's cyclical:



			That's an interesting point. I'm also very cyclical in how I go about things. I came to the conclusion once, that the best way for me to shift my focus from X to Y is to overdo X until I get sick of it, and then do Y in order to get away from X. I also find that I generally won't do X or Y unless it's in order to get away from Z which I want to do even less.

I have this as well, seems to infer to be stuck in Ti.



			Well, I don't know if that's your case, but what do feel is anguish. I'm really anxious. Even when I'm in apathetic mode, the anxiety doesn't go away, I always feel like i should be doing, should have done or will have to do something (physical, emotional, professional, personal, don't matter). I can't get rid of it.

But most of the time it does not make me move, it makes me stall.

Not sure how this helps get shit done:



			One of the time management techniques they can be quite good at is keeping blocks of time open, always open, because if something can go wrong it will! So by keeping blocks of time open, the ISTP is ready!

Someone please expand on this.



			As the ISTP calls upon their ""judging"" and ""intuitive"" functions they can ""right""themselves if they get caught up in logically solving whatever crisis is present.

Assorted thoughts:

 When we are productive, we are very productive. 
 OK, we do great in crisis, but not everythign is a crisis! In fact very little of it is.
 Structure gets help shit done; but I dislike it a lot.
 Real deadlines definitely work. Fakes ones (""I'll do this by 3PM"") - nope.
 I am somewhat more productive in life when I have something physical going on (sports, etc).
 The problem seems to be related to being stuck in the neverending information gathering mode, which is often OFFTOPIC to what needs to be done.
 We easily get absorbed by games/movies/activities, thus enjoy Ti/Se.
 ""Not making it,"" ""I am missing out,"" or ""I am likely to fail"" can motivate me in the short term quite powerfully. Seems to be a form of crisis.
 Commonly suggested fear of failure doesn't mean much to me. I'm not really bothered by that. Failing is a part of learning.
 I have tried all kinds of approaches for procrastination and so on. Didn't help much. Tried a bunch of tools, none of them stuck. 
 I find goals fairly meaningless, regardless of their 'emotional' content.  
 Learning to give a shit might or might not be the correct route. Maybe it's about learning an internal tool/process to get shit done?
Some Leads:

 The frenzy learning mode is fairly unique and powerful. If tamed this would solve this issue. But how to turn it on for things we aren't interested in?
 We are very effective in crisis/troubleshooting mode. But how to use this when it's not crisis? How to turn on the ""CRISIS MODE""?
 Apathy is the negative factor here. But intelectualizing (which we still can do in apathy) doesn't motivate.
 Interest seems to be the rate limiting factor of output.
 Engaging Se seems critical. Something to ""sense."" In crisis it is clearly in overdrive!
 Low inhibition to immediate desires (!!).
So, how do we untangle all of this? 

And then how do we put it together into something usable?

Do your thing, ISTPs - contribute and reap rewards."
"Hello everyone!  Sorry, y'all it's long and it's full of ENFPness, hope you ISTPS don't get discouraged from reading. :laughing:

I'm currently dating an ISTP and I'm an ENFP Type 2/4. We've only been dating for 3 months. However, I feel incredibly one-sided in this relationship. I put a lot of effort (Showing a lot of physical affection, words of affirmation, giving him gifts, etc.), and when a problem arises for me, I try to communicate and find a common ground that makes both of us happy. I feel like I'm the only one putting any input into the problems, I'll ask him what he thinks and he'll say ""I don't know."" I thought you guys were suppose to be fixers lol! He has an incredibly lazy and stoic demeanor. And for the most part, I just assume he's lazy because he never really does anything I propose, such as making any date plans to hang out with me in the future ( I know you guys are known to be bad at this.) but there will be many times he calls and ask to hang out and I'm busy. I find it incredibly selfish, he will just not ask for another day or anything and when I once felt I wanted to spontaneous and selfish and just showed up at his place without telling him and he said I was being inconsiderate (I agree, but literally don't care, trying to be him for a day.), and I get so tired being the initiator all the time, I just don't even suggest an alternative anymore. I feel like not a priority in his life, I feel taken advantaged of, and considering I'm incredibly emotional, I feel emotionally starving.... and it's been so unhealthy for me mentally, cause I'm constantly trying to create turmoil to get attention because communicating doesn't seem to work. Even when we talk about problems, HE apparently doesn't have any problem with me, but I have so many problems with him, but when we talk about it, he just never helps. He listens, I know, but he doesn't say anything and he doesn't do anything to change.. anything. I keep hearing you guys express it through action but he doesn't really do much.. he's pretty physically affectionate but I just think that ties in with sex. He also SLEEPS alot when I'm around, so ""quality time"" isn't really quality to me.. He occasionally smokes pot from what he says but I know potheads go to sleep alot but maybe it just depends on the person. Definitely doesn't say anything romantic, I have to force it out of him by asking him DO YOU LIKE ME like 3 times. He will also hang out with his friends and get drunk alot, and will not text me all day/night, it's not the most important thing but it does make me feel undervalued in his priority list, considering everything else he has or well HASN'T done. I get worried pretty easily, I've had alot of traumatic experiences with death of important people, so I really appreciate them updating me or at least telling me they'll go MIA. He's been better about it but I honestly dont think I have given this relationship enough time. Especially for an ISTP... I don't know if I need to be more patient or just really cut this relationship, it's been incredibly draining trying to carry his ass and leading this relationship, it's like I'm doing all the hardwork and he's just behind me while I cut the obstacles in front of us. Also he's incredibly broke, so we can't really go out and EXPERIENCE a lot of things.. so I try to pay from him once in a while but I felt so taken advantaged of, I just didn't feel good doing it anymore. 

I've suggested to be FWB, see other people, instead of working towards a serious/long-term relationship or possibly an open relationship, so he doesn't have to feel the pressure of what I expect in a relationship as much, but he's HIGHLY against it and only wants us to see each other only. I have no doubt he's honest and faithful but it's like he's living a single lifestyle while wanting a girl with him.. without any obligations/priorities/responsibility of a partner. It's incredibly frustrating. I give him a good amount of space cause I enjoy mines as well, but literally, if I don't ask to hang out or just spontaneously do it, HE WILL RARELY ASK. How can this help maintain a healthy and exciting relationship?? I also don't know why he doesn't just let me go, whenever I try to break up with him, he always sweet talks me into forgiving him and giving him another chance and resumes his unreliable and uncertain ways. Ugh, I just feel like we are so incredibly incompatible and my communication doesn't get through to him and I'm pretty direct. I've asked people around me for their opinions and they all say to dump him because I deserve a lot better, but I think they're biased cause they care for me.. so I want to see you ISTP's perspectives on his behaviors around me and I guess judge mines and what I can do better to accommodate to him but also be able to get more emotionally from an ISTP. I'm not sure if I have anymore patience and literally just want to disappear and ignore his calls/texts maybe just in SPITE of how I feel with him when he goes MIA on me and leave the relationship at that. I'm really trying to save this relationship but it's been really hard, he hasn't proven to me that he'll be a reliable partner in times of need, I mean he could just be too immature, he could also be too shy and needs lots of time to commit to that, he can also not be as interested enough to think it's worth of an effort, etc. He doesn't even feel bad in this relationship.. and I AM FEELING LIKE SHIT he fucks from time to time. thoughts? Maybe I just can't see the big picture or see the little changes that are happening? I have no fucking idea, I'm confused, annoyed, and frustrated. 

Please and thank yous! Other personality types are welcome to chime in too!"
"Hello,

I recently joined the site and have been really impressed with the level of insight shared on this forum. I was hoping someone could help me with a ISTP I just met.

My employer recently hired a new college graduate (25 years old) to fill a vacancy and subsequently my boss asked me to train. I am a 32 year old male INFJ and after getting to know him over the past month of training I am confident he is a ISTP. 

We share similar hobbies and interests and just two days ago he invited me along to one of his hiking expiditions. I was really on the fence about how well he liked me as he is hard to read. Since the invite, he and I both have begun to share a lot more detail about our daily lives - something he for any other person gives a typical ISTP generic answer if asked. 

What brings me here looking for an answer revolves around how this particular ISTP stares at me. For the past week, as I pass by him, I catch him out of the corner of my eye staring at me. Only me. He does not do this towards others and has little interest in how others in the room are behaving. Yet, it is like he watches my every move with his head tilted just enough to see me so he could turn quickly if needed. 

He is a bit immature still and thinks he is being slick when he does this. When I naturally turn in his direction, he quickly adjusts his head like he had no idea I was there. And his facial expression is really weird when he does this with his mouth slightly open. Interestingly as of late, he has started to not pull away and we lock eyes face to face.

Admittedly, I too stare at times at people I am trying to size up. However, how this ISTP stares is unlike anything I have ever encountered as my Feeling trait tells me his overall body language does not correlate like he is trying to ""read me"". 

Then today, I again noticed through a reflection on a piece of glass he was staring at me. A few moments later he mumbled and asked me over to his work station for some help. We work in a lab and he needed to transfer some acid. He asked if I would do it. 

Mind you, he has far more academic experience at this than I do. The task at hand did not at all need two people but I happily obliged. In fact, he had done a similiar task earlier today without me. While I was in the pouring process, he then proceeded to place his hand on the glass container to pour the solution with me.

I don't like to be ""touchy"" at all with someone unless I know them and this really made me uncomfortable as it just simply caught me off guard. If this had been any other coworker I would not even thought twice about it. I felt like he artificially created the task just to get near me.

I have read about how a ISTP can gaze but I was hoping someone could shed some light on why an ISTP stares secretly when they are not upset. I hate to talk myself up but I am usually good at reading body language but he leaves me so perplexed as to his motives. 

Am I overthinking this and was he just trying to study me? Was this a poor social attempt using his physical instinct to create a situation to try to bond? Or perhaps he has a sexual attraction towards me? If so, I read my INFJ personality is not one they typically like. I am curious to understand why an ISTP would secretly stare."
"The first time I took the Mistype Investigator test, I was typed as an ISTP. The second time, I was classified as an ENTP with low Ni. I've taken the test twice, once before breaking my laptop and again after punching some loser in the face and breaking his jaw. I want to know why the same test is showing different scores, despite being praised for its accuracy. My Big five score is an SCOAI regardless, and I am a clear social extrovert who likes to engage with others."
"Hi fellow (likely) ISTPs !
I've been trying to sort it out my MBTI, I get istp on tests and a couple people also agreed with ISTP as type.
However, I cant help to get the feeling that my cognitive functions are a bit off for an ISTP

anyone here with similar results ? is it possible this is a mistype ? if so which type would be more likely for me ?"
"Hey guys. So I'm pretty sure I'm either an ISTP or an ISFP but I don't know which of the two. Can anyone explain to me they key differences by providing some examples...everywhere I look answers are given In a very theoretical matter which only confuses me. Thanks in advance. Also if you want to ask me something to help you determine which one I am, I'm up for that.
If it's of any help, the two results I get the most on enneagram are 9 and 4 and I can say that while 4 sounds a lot like my young teen self, 9 is much more fitting for me now in my 20s."
"As I have said before, people wanting to know more about how cognitive functions work, will benefit from going to Practical Typing.  Ryan (confirmed ISTJ) and Mara (confirmed ISTP type) put a lot of analysis into their articles eliminating the bias from other systems of thought.  Recently Mara gave her thoughts on how IXTP types use extraverted feeling.  Here is what she had to say:




1. Inferior Fe users are anti-marketing

For ISTPs and INTPs, the pure logic or legitimacy of the idea should reign supreme. These types are willing to pursue any idea or thought that might be true, regardless of the implications. However, once they discover what they deem to be true, they don’t want to have to dumb it down for you. (Bear in mind, I’m not saying these types are inherently smart; I’m speaking from their perspective.)

Practically speaking, this means that an IXTP that produces a “novel” idea will innately struggle that idea of marketing that idea to others, beyond relaying or demonstrating the pure rationale of the idea. Stereotypically, this is why you see the genius inventor always teaming up with a business partner. The inventor usually lacks the business sense, and needs the partner, yet often struggles with the tactics utilized by the business partner. In an IXTP’s ideal world, all they should have to do is explain what they produced or thought of, and people should automatically get it and see it’s value. If the idea or product is good, it should thrive without any social effort.

2. Inferior Fe users dismiss the value of connections

High extraverted judgers (FJs or TJs) typically recognizes the value in utilizing the system to their advantage. This often includes the people in it. Remember the saying, “It’s not what you know. It’s who you know”? ISTPs and INTPs by default want to rise through the ranks purely on their own skill, knowledge or merit. They don’t want to have to cater to others, make themselves likeable, etc. That’s not to say they won’t want friends or won’t be personable, but in their minds, none of that should matter in a professional sense or be rooted in a long term success strategy. These types have a strong independent streak. Social connections are not something they’ll want to go out of their way to form.

3. Inferior Fe users may dismiss the value of credentials

Sometimes official education (which typically results in credentials of some kind) is necessary to learn a trade or profession. Other times, one can learn a skill without going through any official program. However, many people value credentials. They like to see it as proof of the person’s expertise or legitimacy. So, in many cases, it’s valuable to “collect” credentials to bolster your personal marketability. This is a concept that INTPs and ISTPs may innately struggle with. After all, like I mentioned in the previous point, they believe their skill/knowledge should speak for itself. The concept of gaining credentials for the sake of currying favor or earning legitimacy will frustrate them and feel like a frivolous waste of time.

4. Inferior Fe users can fail to infuse emotional value into their work

Inferior feelers are often disconnected from their own emotions and emotions in general to some degree. As a result, many inferior feelers struggle to connect with people in a deep, meaningful, or intimate way. However, another aspect of the feeling function is it’s focus on emotional value. People like to relate the feeling functions (and thus, feelers) to values, but technically every individual has values (Feeling vs Thinking: What Are Values?). The feeling functions specifically deal with the personal, emotional, and social implications of values. So, getting back to inferior Fe, the struggle that an INTP or ISTP may have is infusing value into their work in such a way that other people will find it valuable or relatable.

5. Inferior Fe users have anxiety concerning social protocol, not social anxiety in general

OK, here’s where I’ve often gotten inferior Fe wrong. Many people suffer from social anxiety. An IXTP’s anxiety is more specific than that. An IXTP who is starting to develop their inferior Fe, or at the very least, has not suppressed it, will simultaneously feel aware of, yet blind to, social protocol. In other words, they know it’s there, and that it should be adhered to, but they don’t know how to do that. If the IXTP doesn’t care to make any kind of impact or find their role in society, then this awareness may not matter to them. They’ll avoid scenarios that are too cumbersome, and make friends that don’t emotionally or socially pressure them. (People, generally speaking, may not actually be a source of stress.) However, the anxiety will kick in when their inferior Fe begins developing enough to give them a desire to make a social impact or find where they belong.

In the quote above, Carl Jung said, “he is none the less beset by the greatest anxiety if ever he has to make it an objective reality.”

This anxiety is specific to when Ti dominants want to take their ideas/knowledge and implement them within reality (in other words, contribute to society). They’re aware of their struggle to make a social impact and emotionally connect with others, but feel compelled on some level to share their ideas or abilities with the world. In that area, they feel inferior, and fear rejection or failure because of this inadequacy. (Yet, the very idea that they could be successful if they simply found a way to adapt whatever they’re capable of contributing stirs up some level of disdain within themselves because their work in it’s purest form should be good enough.)

I omitted some personal experiences Mara shares in the article.  If you want see what she has to say, you can read the article in its entirety here.  Besides after reading the article, like me I think you will be able to conjure up your own experiences from inferior use of Fe.  Enjoy!"
"If you are an ISTP then tell me what it means when it says you have a strong need for space in a relationship. Give examples. Are you ever called neglectful?



			ISTP Profile"
"Hello ISTPs! In this interview, I got a chance to talk to Heather on what it's like to be an ISTP Ti-Se CS/B(P) FM. This interview was super interesting because you rarely get a chance to talk to an officially typed ISTP female. They almost don't exist! And to make this another rare interview opportunity, Heather is also the super rare FM ISTP! One thing I noticed was that because of gender roles, an ISTP female like Heather has better use of her Fe than male ISTPs. Heather also has double masculine NF blast (Ni+Fe) making her NF quite strong. She is still doing the typical ISTP ST report (Ti-Se), but because it's double feminine, it's not as in your face as her Ni+Fe. Because of her play last (Se+Fe), she tends to lose energy rather quickly and she also disrespects SF play as a result. She's aware of how important SF is but she hates it so it's work in progress for her to improve on it. She's also looking to doing more HIIT based cardio exercise to increase her energy levels which is what she has the most issues with. Because she's still an IxxP, she has people problems and has dealt with tribe hate, especially in her younger days. Overall, it was an insightful interview and there are definitely some differences when you see the male and female variations of the same personality type. Watch the interview here:"
"So I got thinking, again.

ISTPs are known as the rebel types. 
We very rarely conform to any particular norm and when we even sense that we are we immediately rebel against it.
We do things against others wishes. 
We don't care for most people in general.
And we generally don't like being controlled.

Does that mean are actions are spiteful in nature as most of our actions are in effect rebellious against the norm?
Can we really be detached completely from petty emotions when we take these actions?

And what if we aren't aware of it?"
"I was listening to a podcast with Joyce Meng interviewing a group of ISTP types.  There was a part of the segment that alluded to ISTP types neglecting family, friends, etc. and not being conscious of it.  I do that in droves, but I also do it when I leave let's say a job. 

I may have former co-workers attempting to stay in touch, but with anything once I am gone, I leave that aspect of my life behind and don't give it too much thought.  I think this may be related to extraverted sensing where the cognitive function is in the present, not in the past or too far in the future.  Thoughts?"
