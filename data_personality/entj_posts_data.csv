Feel free to ask us anything about relationships with ENTJs that you are curious about or is troubling you.

Here in the ENTJ forum, we get asked these types of questions quite a bit - so much so that we've dedicated this sticky to them.Please do not open a new thread in our main forum. If you start a new thread there, one of us will most likely redirect you here.  

We would prefer that you ask your relationship question here for two reasons:

There is a lot of overlap in the types of questions that get asked. Having all the questions here in one thread makes it easier for people to read through it and find answers to their questions and dialogue with each other. 

Having multiple open threads on the same relationship topic clutters up our forum and makes it hard for us and others to find general topic discussions. Please keep in mind that as Te-doms, we dislike this sort of thing. Your cooperation is appreciated. 

We'll be happy to answer any questions you might have. 

Please post your relationship questions here."

"“And the punishment of “sitting in the tub” saw the convicted person placed in a wooden tub with only their head sticking out. The executioner would then paint the victim’s face with milk and honey. Flies would begin to swarm around the victim’s nose and eyelids. The victim was also fed regularly and fairly soon, they would virtually be swimming in their own excrement.

At which stage maggots and worms would devour their body. One victim apparently survived for 17 days — he decayed alive.”

"You guys might want to check out this post I made to INTJ Forum. I got pretty controversial outcome from these answers. I’d appreciate also your opinion on this original matter. Seems like, I got some good info from our introverted colleagues, but also my fair share of well-earned criticism.

Quoting myself, something I really love.



			This is especially for you INTJ females. I hope you can give me your  opinion in an abjective manner, without taking a side of neither of us.

I have female INTJ co-worker, that I had this romantic relationship for  few months. Today we are friends or something, I'm actually not sure  about what is the status of two of us. The relationship we had started  really sparkling and we soon became lovers after getting really know  each other. Actually we had been working together at same company for  few years before our patches crossed. Before I get to know her, I  actually hated her .

I really dig this girl, or you could almost say that I'm (still) in love  with her. It seems pretty hard for me to know how I should react to her  because of her kind of introverted and bit of obscure nature.

In+Te+Fi

We have pretty similar ideas about lots of things and the conversations  are fenomenal. Still for some reason it seems that it is pretty easy for  us to get into argument, because we both really stand out with our own  opinions and statements. We both are orally very talented and we are  both used to rule the conversations and winning the battles.

The reason why it seems that I have trouble of understanding her is that  I see how much her inner values and intuitive introversion defects on  her opinions. It seems that her opinions are based on inner values and  intuitions and the facts (Te) are selected on a base on what suits her  best. For that she seems bit subjective at all times.

This gets me on my toes, because I really value the facts (Te) and form  my opinions and the big picture (Ni) based on them and valuing objective  opinions really high. We often seem to get on the same conclusions  through different kind of paradigm. We don't have absolutely any problem  of understanding the wholeness, besause we both can see the big picture  well. It is just that one goes from Ni(+Fi) -> Te and the other from  Te(+Se) -> Ni.

Psycological evaluation

When our romantic relationship started to go down hill, our debates  become more aggressive and she started to blame me for a lots of things.  Of course that is a logical thing to happen when two people are falling  apart from relationship. She really seemed to get inside of my head and  made some pretty far going psycological conclusion about me.

I think we both value ourselves pretty high and don't cope well with  critisism. When she started to blame me for making her feel bad and not  appreciating her (which is not true) I tried to argue back and look the  situation from more objective site. That didn't go well and she blamed  me for lack of self-reflection. That might be true, because as an ENTJ, I  admit that for time to time I have some difficulties about my inner  control.

She was really demanding and anything I tried to explain her didn't make  any point. I treid to rationalize how relationship was a compromise of  two people and hoe both of us should try to understand each other.  Dispite of that she always came to conclusion that I should change  myself to became what she wants. I think that is beacause on her  introversion (Fi) and lack of external feeling function that makes it  hard for her to understand other people. To be honest I have say that I  may suffer from same thing.

The way she critisised me was pretty harsh and it actually made me to  question myself and kind of crumbled my self-confidence. That is  something that has never happened before.  I got really depressed ant it  took few months for me to get my game back together.

Obviuos feelings, still so introvert

What comes to her, it was a kind of suprise to me, how unwilling she was  talking about her feelings or thoughts, even when I saw that there were  something that bothered her. I'm not blind when comes to sensing other  peoples thoughs and way they behave. Ofcourse this is natural behaviour  of introverted thinker, but because of her strong presence I was able to  read her pretty well on that.

I tried to make her really open up for me, and I guess I did that pretty  aggressive way and when I didn't get anything out of her, I kind of did  what ENTJ's do and tried to  control or manipulate her. That really was  the end of everything and I managed to pissed her of. I've come clean  to her about that and apoligized for my stupid behaviour.

How does it go now?

After we broke up, she was kind of hostile towards me. I think that kind  of intensive behaviour is normal for INTJ when someone has got close  enough to brake the introverted mask. She still blames me for how I made  her feel and despite of the fact, that I've been her really honest  towards her about my own depressions, she still kind of tries to get  some revenge on me. I don't think that is nessessarily her goal. I  actually see that as an somekind of defensive mechanism towards her own  feelings.

We still spend time together especially at work and we use a lot of time  to discussing about everything. We have kind of agreement about  friendship, but the way she acts is not how a friend would act. Actually  is more of how (bad) girlfiend acts. 

Though she says that I no more mean nothing to her she still sticks her  nose up to my things. She also still seems to have really specific ideas  about me and how I should behave towards her. I mean this as a positive  way. For me it is pretty obvious that she still cares about me or at  least has somekind of feelings. I know her well enought to know that she  wouldn't spend this much time to something without any meaning.

Of course when I by a joke try to get her to confess her feelings, she  denies it. We haven't really had serious conversation. I'm not even sure  would that work on curnt situation.

The thing I want to know is can you ladies relate to this and what is  your opinion? I don't know if I need any advices, because I'm not even  sure, what I'm going to do about her and what I think of her.

"Hi all!
Recently I've let down an ENTJ that I value very much. Some factors combined let to me being much less efficient in meeting our common goal, which clearly led to this ENTJ being frustrated. Now I want to apologize. I mean, I've already done so, but it feels like it didn't really work, as they kinda... retreated inwards or something. So, I would really love to get some help and advice... How to apologize to an ENTJ... properly?

Thanks in advance!"

"My sister is an ISFJ, mom, well liked in her community by a large circle of friends. She has a lot of girlfriends, throws parties and other types of gatherings/events several times a year. She has a fairly calm demeanor and harmony focused when it comes to the group. She doesn't speak up or advocate for herself, even when she really should. Doesn't want to rock the boat or cause problems. 

I, on the other hand, am a train wreck when it comes to socialability. Not that I'm an awkward dork who can't drum up conversation and have a good time. Kind of the opposite tbh. And for sure I'm a very intense person to be around and realize that people don't always appreciate the force of my personality (note: I'm something like 90th percentile for assertiveness and 4th percentile for politeness in Big 5).  So in terms of personal relationships, I stick with a very small group of people that can handle being around me  (my ENTJ partner, an ENTJ girlfriend and an INTJ girlfriend).

So the other day my sister advises that I need to make more friends for my kids' sake (in grade 5 and grade 2).  That I should get to know my kids' friends parents, invite them over, be friendly, etc. That I shouldn't be so reclusive and anti-social (funny coming from an introvert).

Well, I strongly prefer that a friendship with another human develops organically rather than out of obligation. And I've genuinely already tried to be friends with other mommies, who always seem to be busy or unavailable when I reach out for the kids' sake to do something. I won't chase anyone for any reason, especially a social reason. If they want to socialize with me, I'm fine with that but no way I'm going to keep reaching out if there is no reciprocity.  Admittedly, I don't care much for making friends if I think I can't be myself around them. 

But I see my sister's point in a way. What can I do to not fuck it up and make myself more ""likeable"" and ""agreeable?""  Is it possible to fake being a shrinking violet? The thought makes me feel slimy and inauthentic."

Flirting only in this thread. I'll start things off:
"I met this ENTJ guy more than a year ago through an online dating app. It was during pandemic and we're fm diff countries. We hit it off quickly and he said he was interested but i cldnt stand him taking too long to respond and missing our scheduled calls without notice. I wld confront him and he'd apologize. As an ENFP i felt disrespected that he didnt take time to keep me posted. and I needed more fluid interaction. I politely ended it. He was apologetic and told me that there had been so much going on in his life, renovating and selling his house to move to another state. We reconnected two months ago and are getting really close. I asked him so many times if he is really interested and can handle a long distance relationship and willing to fly to me, and every time i asked, he said yes. But a part of me is still skeptical if he will keep his word. He's always busy but he texts me every day but doesnt initiate calls. We wld video call sometimes but very seldom and i always had to request for it. He said he's not into calls much and promised it will be a lot better when we meet in person. He said he stopped talking to other women when we reconnected and wld fly to me in a couple of months. He told me he's really blessed to have me in his life and wants to really build a relationship with me. We think alike and have thesame core values and perspectives in life. A part of me is still skeptical. Im catching deep feelings and im scared that he might be just stringing me along.I dnt want to invest time and emotions on someone oversees who turns out to be not serious and wont keep his word. I have the tendency to believe ppl easily for their words bec i am very honest myself and wldnt say anything i dnt mean and some ppl dont i get in trouble sometimes. Do some ENTJs lie and string ppl along? I have no way of finding out since he's too far. No way to validate if he aint talking or seeing other women in his country. I want to believe and trust him but i keeping myself fm expecting much coz im scared of getting hurt."
"Hello, I am a 4w5 INFP woman, and I would like to know how to seduce an ENTJ man when you have this profile. I realize that the crushes that I really had, but whose relationship was very complicated, were ENTJ men.

I specify that I am French, and that I speak English badly (I help myself with a translator). Please try to write sentences that are not too complicated."
"My ENTJ ex-boyfriend told me that he is still sad about our break up..

It’s been six months.. we haven’t talked for  3months until today that I messaged him if its okay to send back his stuff..

I’m in a new relationship now… happy but I know I was happier with him.. well this post is not about me..

He told me that he misses me a lot and our relationship was so beautiful and he regrets it a lot on how he behaved and if he could punch his old self for acting the way he did during our relationship.

He wishes to see me someday by accident on the mall or elsewhere..

I was a big part of his life and he’s happy that I came to his life..

I wished him all the best in life and hope he finds happiness..

We cannot undo the things we’ve done. I love him but I think it is the best we don’t go back.. I don’t want more people to get hurt.

I understood my ex entj boyfriend.. how his mind works.. how to help him.. how to make him understand things..

I’m just in shock that he still cares for me.
He broke up with me and was sure he lost interest in me during our relationship."
Im just getting to know this guy. He's very busy during weekdays so we just exchange msgs from time to time. He told me we'd talk more on the weekend but he didnt call. I asked him if he really is interested and that he should make more time if he really wants to get to know me and he said yes. I told him to set a schedule if that would help but he didnt do it. He just kept saying sorry. I thought entjs are very intentional. Does this mean he's really not interested?
"It just very recently occured to me that I naturally shift into more of an abrasive hardass persona when dealing with ENTJs.

If I had to explain why, I would say it's my 4th slot Te trying to shove its way forward.

I'll be honest, I only really typed this up in the hopes that, in saying things, I would end up figuring out the exact mechanics of this phenomenon.

I've got nothin. An ENTJ enters the room and suddenly I'm a Te gripping asshole.

Oh well."
"Hey

I happen to be a big horror fan. I was wondering out of these horror franchises which do you prefer and why? Mainly want to see if there's any pattern amongst NTJ's on which one."
"I have been wondering, of course ENTJs can also show warmth and be empathic and compassionate. But I think it may come across as different? Someone, who says they are an ENTJ (though I have no idea if they typed themselves accurately, I do not know them well), said that they show empathy and compassion without the theaterics of emotions, they just can not be very emotionally expressive but they can still show it. They would look at other people's emotions with a more critical lens. 

I imagine that ENTJs may not be very expressive, which is why they can come across as cold - but they can also be warmer towards a selective group of people they consider to be close to them. Or, you can also be empathic and compassionate without being warm. It just can come across as cold to some people.

ENTJ and high emotional intelligence would also be a great combination.

What do you all think?"
Just wondering. Cause all rationals people are suppose to be so call smart!
"Here is a thread to help support ENTJs to tease their brain and the brain of their friends and co-workers with optical illusions or games.

[Mind this one below is not the same as intuitive in MBTI as it may be related to S/F instead of N/T]

Optical Illusion Test: There are people who like to submerge themselves in practical, logical, and mathematical concepts, and then there are people who zone out into the beautiful world of art.

What if we say that specific interpretations of a picture can give an insight into your personality, especially tell you whether you are logical or not?

Optical Illusion Test: There are people who like to submerge themselves in practical, logical, and mathematical concepts, and then there are people who zone out into the beautiful world of art.

What if we say that specific interpretations of a picture can give an insight into your personality, especially tell you whether you are logical or not?

Here you go! Have a look at the picture for 5 seconds and figure out what you see first.

If You Saw 3 Bears:

If you saw three gray bears, it may imply that you have an analytical mind. You analyze facts and figures well and possess a logical approach. You do not take actions on an impulse; rather prefer a step-by-step approach to things.

Moreover, you go by rules and regulations and prefer the conventional routes to lay a secure and solid foundation. When given a chance, you bring out the most logical arguments and details that probably others miss to catch.

When given a problem or a critical situation, you do not see a problem as a whole, but rather attempt to break the problem into separate concepts, thereby making the situation manageable.

You are an efficient problem solver, probably the best in the room. You have a piercing eye for details, as is evident by the fact that you could easily find the three gray bears in the picture.

Optical Illusion: Can you spot four crabs among these lobsters in 11 seconds?

Optical Illusion: Can you spot the hidden frog in 5 seconds?

If You Saw The Snowy Mountains:

In case you saw the snowy mountains first, even if you later realized that there are three bears as well in the picture, you are an intuitive thinker.

You follow your inner voice and you rarely get disappointed by it. Your intuitive powers are your strongest weapon, even if you realize it or not. Even if people insist you go right, you would tread toward the left.

Your intuition is strong and often right. You may sometimes miss facts, but you rely on your past experiences to guide you ahead. Your strong gut instinct acts as a compass for you, helping you make firm decisions despite all adversities and oppositions.

Moreover, this trait of yours does not make you indecisive, instead, you are pretty efficient in your decision-making. You are intelligent enough to interpret patterns and styles of a particular situation, which means that you not only deal with the information at hand, you also try to think out of the box.

Why Optical Illusion Tests?

Psychologists all over the globe are fans of projective tests that, unlike those wordy questionnaires demanding one to think critically, do not prove to be a pain to the head.

Instead, they showcase ambiguous pictures to bring out the hidden aspects of one’s personality that are deeply rooted in the subconscious realm.

Similarly, optical illusion, too, sometimes attempts to pull out strands of personality traits of individuals that may be hidden from the awareness of the person himself. Such images are designed so as to deceive our brains.

This obliges the brain to not follow any logical rules of thinking, thereby allowing them to perceive the picture in freewill.

What you spot in such pictures first defines in what direction your brain thinks and sometimes, perhaps your innermost desires!

"It's a gander because I don't know much about Ms. Porter, but I would type her Fieldmarshal/Mobilizer ENTJ based exclusively on her questioning during congressional hearings.

Mobilizing task forces within government....


Mobilizing leadership hierarchies within government, leader of leaders.....


Many of the leaders that she's leading at the congressional hearings appear to be our friends, the adjudicating Guardians (SJ).  They seem to respect her, which is to be expected for a leader of leaders.  The problem with Fieldmarshals/Mobilizers (the smart ones, anyway) is that they are rare because leaders need leaders too and Fieldmarshals prefer that role more than other types.

Apparently she's running for California Senate in 2024 and I imagine she ought to have success in that pursuit, but politics can be greasy."
"Is it...

ESTJ, because they share Te as a dominant function?

INTJ, because they use Te and Ni, but with different emphasis?

INTP, because they share the T-N-S-F function order, but with all functions in opposite orientation?

ENTP, because you believe J/P is the least important dichotomy?

ENFJ, because you see Te and Fe as similar enough that the ENJ pattern is most important?

ISTP, because they have dominant Thinking paired with Ni/Se?

ESFP, because they have a Te-Se external face/loop?"
"Hi,

Need advice from fellow ENTJ based on an situation that is crippling my confidence.

There is this project, in which I have submitted certain proposal to achieve the objectives of the brief.

However, everyone who saw the brief say that I am wrong. Even when I do provide my extensive rationale, they did not agree to it. Often when I provide explanation, people do understand and is convince, yet this time its the opposite. I have also listened to others opinion with a OPEN MIND, yet their reason seems to not be able to convince me as well. I truly want to agree with what the majority is telling me, yet I couldn't because I am not convinced by their rationale, and I am not the type to just accept the norm or incorrect rationale and I rather do what is correct and precise. Also, I am not saying it out of ego, as I am truly willing to be convince and change my mind if other's rationale is correct.

So I am kind of stuck in the middle, in which I am not convinced, and others are not convinced by me. Thus, I am now questioning my own sanity, judgement, rationale, and even my own learning and observation if they are true or not, that what I belief might be irrational, personal and subjective, because like I said, usually people are convince by my rationale, yet it seems that I am the only one convinced by my rationale and everyone DISAGREE with me, even after I provide my extensive explanation. I am just afraid that I am dealing with a blind spot that I could not see. I have also self reflect and question my rationale, but it still seems that what I propose still holds true, which makes me doubt my own rationale even more, yet I could not just accept others opinion because they are false.... (I am judging this situation without my ego making the calls)

What advice would you give in this situation, and what would fellow ENTJ does in a situation when they truly believe they are rationally correct WITHOUT EGO even after hearing the opinion of others? 

Thank you in advance!"
"Just a reddit post with the same title I thought it was fun, I'll start:

You shouldn't always want to be right"
"Apparently ENTJs are the most compatible type for an INTP. I have met a few ENTJ women, and yeah, we got along really well. Granted they were much older than me, kids, etc.

My question is, how and where do you find single ENTJ girls?

In Indiana, simply finding girls that are single is a daunting task. Let alone one that's compatible with me. 

It's like girls here don't leave the house unless they're ""escorted"" by a man.
If it weren't for the trees and grass, I'd swear I'm living in Saudi Arabia. 

Actually, I recently visited downtown Chicago. While I was there, I saw a lot of women just walking down the street by themselves. It blew my mind, which is really sad."
"Hi Infjs and Entjs 

do you guys think this pair is compatible romantically? Why, and why not?"
"I've heard the usual is ""Tall dark and handsome"" for ENTJ. Would agree with this?

What is your body type? 

Also do you think it would differ a little depending on the gender?

In what ways?
"Hello,

I'll just get right to it. I have an ENTJ ""friend"" that I hired to do my interior design for my first home and for the most part he's done a good job with the heavy lifting and coordinating. I however have a few significant pain points (as the project comes to a close I'm realizing this more and more).

He makes significant changes to our original agreements, perhaps because he thinks of a ""better"" way but he never discusses this with me beforehand, and some of the changes had to be reverted because I didn't like or agree with them. The latest of these was the setup of my TV which was way too high for my liking and comfort. Even though I specifically mentioned to not set it up without me multiple times, he did it anyway and assured me I'd be happy with the result. When I visited to confirm this, I told him about it and he immediately deflected and asked me where was I when the setup was being done. I mentioned that I was never informed but he insisted I was. Needless to say I wasn't happy at what seemed to be a blatant lie...and had to pay to get it lowered (Had it done by professionals this time since the risk was much higher)
He is really hasty and doesn't listen. I'll ask a questions and he'd go on this long rant which comes off as condescending to me only for me to state he didn't even understand my question in the first place. This has happened multiple times, my questions are very straight forward but it's like he's stuck on what he thinks I'm asking and not what I'm actually asking? (I double check my questions with my friends in these cases to make sure I'm not crazy)
He takes the glory for many of the design choices that I came up with. It doesn't bother me as much as the other points really but it is a bit odd

To be honest, a part of me feels bad to complain because he worked really hard and did a good job in many aspects, but I'm really irked by what comes across as a lack of accountability. He has never apologized for any of his mistakes and has even unfairly deflected some onto myself. What is up with that? Is it an ego thing? Do ENTJs have a hard time admitting they're wrong and apologizing?"
"Hi Peeps,

Fellow ENTJ here.
I need some practical advice regarding some work issues I am facing at work with my manager.

For me, I often can see the inefficiency in things and try to change the way of doing certain things at work to make things more efficient. My manager sees it differently and prefer to do things the same way he has been doing things.

The thing is, I feel both of us are not wrong. It is just that I am an overachiever and tend to want to do things the best I could. Yet my manager prefer to do things “just good enough”, and value efficiency over quality, as such he can complete things in just 1 to 2 days, but I am requesting for a week to complete, which he declined my proposal. The thing is, the deadline is still far, and there are ample time to do things and don’t understand why is he rushing me to do things his way. I have even highlighted this issue with him, but the answer I got from him is by far, vague. In fact, I’m still unsure why he made such a decision.

The reason why I need a week to do things because I am an industrial designer, and I want to elevate my company product quality as much as possible, and often require time to think of innovative ways to find solutions to create great products, but because my manager just wants things good enough and value efficiency, therefore he expect me to do the same and give me the same deadline, which I can’t, because like I say, I want to create really great products for the company and humankind to be honest, which require time to think.

Again, I have tried addressing his concern and tells him I have a different agenda compare to him, and that the deadline is still far, I don’t see the issue of needing to rush and prompted him to let me try my method of doing things. At last, he dictated me to follow his method.

I am at the point I feel like resigning, as this is not once I have such communication breakdown with him and only to have him dictating me. I have tried to just be a good follower and do whatever my manager says without questioning… but I feel dead inside, as if my work has no purpose and I am doing just for the paycheque. Eventually, I decided to be clear with my agenda, which is actually beneficial to the company; therefore I have many conflict yet the manager cannot find a reason to fire me, because he has to explain to my director. Because I didn’t do anything wrong, he cannot just report to the director regarding the issues that is happening between us.

The reason why I feel like resigning because first I find it difficult to work with a manager that makes inefficient decision and there is nothing I can do about it and have to do work that I do not believe in the first place. Such torture is something I have to accept if I continue working here (I just have an realisation writing this lol) 

I wonder what will fellow ENTJ do here. Feel free to be direct and criticise me if there is anything I have done wrongly. If you need me to explain the situation in deeper detail, feel free to ask as I intend to keep this post short.

Thanks in advance!"
"This is the line of my favorite ENTJ  character from Overwatch Doomfist. 

Doomfist seeks to start a war between the machine and humanity, just because of the first war with the Omnics. He makes the point that the first war updgraded humanity because of natural selection and want to make humanity evolve once more.

Even if the situation is a little too extreme here
Do you think the line is true though? Or do you think it is a simplification of what ENTJs are ?"

"Hey everyone, new poster here so I apologize if there are threads similar to this one.

Most entries about ENTJ's state that once their decision is made to break up with a partner, it's final and there's no looking back. I just wanted to know what goes on in your heads when ""it's over""? Especially if you were in a serious relationship and they were your first true love?

From what I understand, ENTJ's tend to not be sentimental and move on fairly quickly? Do you guys ever think about your ex's and if so what triggers that train of thought (places, songs, dreams, etc.)? How often do you think of them and how long does it take you guys to get over them?

I know it varies from relationship to relationship and why you break up so I guess I'll add some background as to why I'm asking:My boyfriend and I had been dating for a year and 4 months long distance and I was his first girlfriend. He is fairly religious so he wanted to wait until he met someone really special. At the pinnacle of our relationship he would baby me all the time, talk about our future and how he wanted to take care of me-we've met each other's parents and friends, went on short trips together and would fly to see each other every now and then. We've had our fights but in the end we usually took them as signs of growth. It wasn't until I became really depressed (being far away from my friends and family and all) that things started getting a little messy... Initially we broke up because I became more needy and he told me he didn't know how to take care of me anymore.

If you are an ENTJ and broke up with your girlfriend, have you ever gotten back together with her? Do you guys still have a sweet spot for that extra special someone? How do you guys move on so well? I'm an ENFP/ENTJ so I'm a very sentimental hopeless romantic type of girl."
"If there's one personality type that I'll never understand unless I ask someone who has the type personally about how they act and what their thought processes looked like, it's you guys, the ENTJs.  I don't understand why I can grasp every single type that doesn't have Ni as their dominant or auxiliary function, ESPECIALLY auxiliaries, probably due to a lack of Ni-based knowledge.

Because I know so little about you guys, I can only really use stereotypes and blanket statements as of now.  Stereotypes such as cruelly and coldly efficient plan-makers, but that doesn't fit right with me no matter how much I try and convince myself.

So, basically, what makes an ENTJ tick?  What do you strive for?  How are you like around others?  What's your take on your extraversion?  How does an inferior Fi work with you guys?  Tertiary Se?  What's something you look most forward to in life? (Don't answer all of these, I got a little sidetracked and just kept coming up with questions to ask! <_>)

Thanks!"
