"I just typed ""INTJ woman feelings"" into Google, and nothing came up! :crazy:

Okay, so it did once I pressed the enter key...but anyway, after I stopped laughing it got me to thinking - what makes you really laugh, INTJs? Stories, pictures, videos, whatever tickles your funny bone - post it here!"
"So I found this in the INFP section and thought it would be useful for my fellow INTJS. Courtesy of Nova.

Take issue with something going on in society?

Having a bad day?

Have something on your mind that wont go away?

Experience something so fabulous you just have to express it?


Post your vent here!



+ And a friendly reminder to please be respectful to other members and leave your baggage at the door."
"There's a thread like this in the ESTJ forum, and I thought it would be beneficial here. It might help clear up some preconceived notions and stereotypes of INTJ's while also reducing some unnecessary threads. 

So here, any type can ask a question. Any INTJ can answer.

But remember, we are people too. :mellow: We eat, sleep, and piss like everyone else.

So ask away!"
"Post your mugs. Let's see if we can break a record for least amount of posts until this thread is locked, the fifth INTJ photos thread.

EDIT:
Just for the record, I didn't put **Stay on topic** in the thread title. That is a warning from the mods. Although I agree, I won't have words put in my mouth. It is also a little insulting that our type is the only one with such a warning. I would have thought that the fact that our thread is on the 5th volume was sufficient enough. That is all."
"Post about anything creative you made - photos are fun to see!  (It'll be interesting to see if anyone posts in this thread!)
Idea shamelessly stolen from the INTP forum, btw.  Some neat things going on there - the pressure is on people!  ;-)

I love embroidery and textile crafts and crafts in general too.  Here is some of my stuff (oh, and  I made the babies wearing the home-made hats too.  It's actually much  harder making babies than people claim...).

I present to you - random crap!  (Can't take creadit for the pottery, just the turtle paint-job.  Last photo of a career poster made for an scout exhibition - trying to convince the kids that ChemE is the way to go.  lol  Edit: Woups, had to remove.  Forgot the company logo...)"

"Here, feel encouraged to ask as many questions on relationships or love or sex or dating with INTJs as you see fit, And we'll get around to answering as many as our 'cold, little robot hearts' can manage.
:laughing:

Remember, though, we're just here to give advice, it's up to you to take action. :wink:"
"I mean pose on me an interest which i sure don't have, but do it for yourself.
That may be one of those things i'm good at myself. Or don't. If such it would still mean then that i really am.

Right there am i asking you to do exactly whatever i would do on myself, excepted that the me that i am is ""expecting"" it himself, that further, am i not of no use, as used of, from its use. The question is then: Are you of such use you, yourself more than i am ?

I call this reducing method by two famous literary names: the Dickens (for the English people)-Sand (for the French people) method. Why and how is it so ?

Why ?: Because for me, and it is confirmatively noted and/or explored as such, the first is responsible for having written one of the non-so-cruelly clear/unclear and ""easy/difficult on the mind"", ""lightest"" literary transcriptions of the killer-victim relation, invading step by step the world of temptationed reality in psychic dreams, in fact more really, the most unraw bodily reality, then already psychically anti-beauty reality, without.a.time.to.do.anything reality (see the concept here), then counter-impressionistic reality, up until the ""last"" conceded moment of the victim, the not so so-called heavy moment, isn't it...: an ""anti-beauty"" moment was her of his killer, to desacralize completely, to clean-up whatever would then be of beauty, against beauty, of such reality(ies), a crime, but not really........... a crime, in all those ends: A crime of a then invisibly forced beauty.
He simply wrote the most out of facts, psychic, again, most light Facts-Of-The-Crime like still to this day nobody else to ever did it more in any manner than he did for himself: there was not an already, only some d√©j√†-vu, like a programmer-screenwriter of a crime TVfilm in the now would merely display luxuriously out of the most simple self-kindness too. Delightful !! But incomplete, by itself, still...

What remains interesting is not the ""in the now"", but ""the moment"".
‚ÜíHow ?: The second head simply got from the all other way around of the Why, if you're familiar with (?). I just dare say it.

Well, there is that.

So make the mic talk, not speak to you. Tell him about your interests... or not, you will be recorded, of course. Imagine you're either Dickens, either Sand... (they're both, supposedly, ENFP: ""were"" would, just be (not) a bit (not) more true) but you then have to be both of them, or neither of both. And that i am the method (lone ESTP subconscious). It worked !
üéô
~Be your classic and unclassic you. No use of traditional here. Feel good, i am. I don't know. Maybe you're in the nature of my subconscious, and you may be the killer of this method.~


By the way do you have some advice on making in bold texting in the title section of a thread, i would appreciate it. Hope you had a great Christmas, either passing or celebrating."

"I don't remember the source but here are some numbers:




			‚Ä¢	Other personality traits being the same, an iNtuitive person (one who grasps patterns and seeks possibilities) is 27 times more likely to have a higher IQ than a Sensing person (one who focuses on sensory details and the here-and-now).
‚Ä¢	Again, other traits being the same, an Introverted person is 8 times more likely to have a higher IQ than one who is Extraverted; a Thinking (logic-oriented) person is 2.5 times more likely to have a higher IQ than a Feeling (people-oriented) person; and a Judging person (one who seeks closure) is about twice as likely to have a higher IQ than a Perceiving person (one who likes to keep his options open).
‚Ä¢	Moreover, if you encounter an INTJ (Introverted, iNtuitive, Thinking, Judging), there is a 37% probability that his IQ places him in the top 2 percent of the population (about 4 out of 10). The probability is 20% for an INTP, 15% for an INFJ, and 8% for an INFP. These four types account for 66% of the high-IQ population but only 6% of the total population.

This doesn't make me think I'm superior; it makes me feel sad. 

What do you think?"
"Stereotypically TJ types are success-oriented and hard working. 

Do you think INTJs are more prone to laziness than say, ESTJs and ENTJs, who are usually very career oriented and always have something planned? It seems like a lot of ""gamer types"" are INTJs and I don't see them as being the hard working people, lol."
"From what I've gathered from certain people, this combo isn't possible because 8 is too ""impulsive"" and like to act first and then ask questions later. Whereas, INTJ are careful thinkers who prefer to consider the consequences.

What do you think?"
"So to clear things up, I‚Äôll link my post that is related, you can read it for more deeper context.


Been texting/talking to this INTJ for a while (2-3 months?) I‚Äôm worried he puts up with me for the sake of being polite. I have a lot of doubts when talking to people, because I‚Äôm scared they‚Äôre all acting friendly for the sake of superficiality.
I‚Äôm simply worried he‚Äôs mentally stressing himself to talk to me lol, so I wanted to know. And I also really like this guy because he seems to be a really smart and generally nice individual.

He doesn‚Äôt initiate conversation but keeps it at a good timeframe (text)
He sometimes asks about my well-being back
Generally, he always keeps me updated with where he is, what he‚Äôs doing right now, or when he has to go because of something
Most of the things we talk about is generally surface, unless I ask him first about something more deeper
His answers are pretty brief (other than updating me on his status.) Does use a lot of lols and laughing
I was busy with my work for a while and after like a week or two, he‚Äôs messaged me if my work was over. -> this happened only once though during the first time I was so busy. The next time it didn‚Äôt happen lol
most importantly, I‚Äôve actually tried showing my affection to them like ‚ÄòI missed talking to you,‚Äô ‚ÄòYou‚Äôre so smart,‚Äô or anything like that. He never reciprocated a single time and didn‚Äôt reply to it lol
If I‚Äôm being too detail nitpicky, I‚Äôll tell you our conversations generally are surface level.. still.
example of text:

Me: which came to mind, what other games have you been playing lately
INTJ: I've been playing this recently
Me: Oh my god I wanted to play that so much is it fun?
INTJ: Oh actually?
INTJ: Yeah It's cool



			usually just‚Ä¶replies with Yeah it‚Äôs cool or yeah that‚Äôs good. Doesn‚Äôt really explain unless I actually ask about it though

Me: Hey I'm late but hope you're enjoying your lunch  I failed to maintain my sleep cycle
Me: Actually I should stop watching stuff at night just because I can't in the day üòÇ I'll see you in the morning
INTJ: Ok see you üòÇ
Me: Good morning I woke up so late omg
INTJ: Good morning lol
INTJ: It's 10 pm here I'm playing games lol I‚Äôm going to sleep at 1am and wake up at 6



			provides me a lot with what he‚Äôs currently doing, what he‚Äôs about to do, etc etc‚Ä¶ not sure if this is just an INTJ thing though
		
Click to expand...

INTJ: I'm about to go to school now and they make us put our phones away now so I might not be able to respond for a while
Me: Oh don't worry about it I have to sleep soon to maintain a healthy sleep cycle as well
(some while later)INTJ: I'm at lunch now



			again provides me with his current status

Me: Oh how is school 
INTJ: It's not bad 
Me: I'm glad to hear that I hope you're doing alright 
Me: I missed talking to you 
INTJ: Yeah I'm doing good 
INTJ: How are you



this is the text I‚Äôve been confused about, he didn‚Äôt really comment on my feeble attempts to show affection üòî (also, his replies are short as you can tell)

Click to expand...



i really like this guy because he just seems to be so nice and smart and generally just relaxing vibe, I‚Äôm not sure at all about how he thinks of me- just polite acquaintances one day to be lost, just friends, or romantic? No idea.. thanks in advance"
"someone asked me in one of the Enfp threads about why a lot of villians are Intjs, and I started to wonder about the certain perpectives Intjs have about the world.

How do you, Intjs, view the world and if you conquered and were in the position to control anything and everything, what all would you do?"
"Take this with a grain of salt, I just made it."
"Of course, an INTJ can be alone and not feel bad or lonely.

In fact, sometimes a lot can be accomplished by oneself.

And, sometimes? Solitude is an INTJ's friend.



But. . . . . What Does An INTJ Do When Feeling Lonely??

Can an INTJ feel overwhelmingly alone??

Or. . . . is it just the way we are built. . . some part of us is always lonely. . . ????


You???"
"Are INTJ men usually into motherly women? I have two male INTJ friends and it's weird how they both seem to like women who love children, are open about their feelings and are in overall very caring. Dating or even marrying someone who doesn't share their intelligence seems to be ok for them. I don't understand it and it's difficult for me (INTP) to get along with the women my friends go out with."
"First of all, context: I met her in february and it was very casual, just things like ""hi, how are you?"" Kisses on a cheek, hugs and all of that but things got more real 3 months ago, when i begin to feel a strong connection and understandment with her. 
We begin talking more frecuently through text, most of the time she was the first one in sending a message, asking for my hobbies, where did i live and all that stuff, making emphasis in my interest in mathematics and physics even though she is not very good at it. Then came something that i call ""The Proximity Paradox"" She begin to sit next to me at every moment,following me wherever i went and leaving me alone when i was stressed or tired, sudden physicall touches BUT also she stopped kissing or huging me. By this moment she does it but feels weird, but i notice that she keeps giving that kind of affection with acquaintances and friends, so... i don't know 

During this last 3 months she has been very kind to me, helping me when i need it, giving compliments about my intelligence, my clothes, my personality, sometimes just being there, giving me gifts like paper planes that she made, chocolates, drawings and recently taking me pictures. But this thing when she mention her ex (few times) or when she mention that was seeing a guy in february but making very clear that was just as friends or recently when she mention how she try to ""date"" an attractive guy 4 months ago by buying a postal, makes me thing that i'm just her friend. Last week, in a conversation about trust she mention that ""most of the time she enjoys her loneliness but sometimes needs someone that understands"" She is very closed off about her emotions and personal things with almost everyone and don't have someone else on that line

So, generally speaking, i don't know and lately i've been thinking about confessing my feelings and i would be very happy to hear all of your comments. I don't have trouble with honesty cause i think it's better, even if it hurts..."
Any INTJ Female had any experience dating an ISFP Male? How was it like? I'm interested because we both share the same cognitive functions. I've spoken to a few INTJ women and find them interesting to talk to.
How do you behave in general ?
"Where words fail, music speaks. 

What are some songs you like? I love my music.
I am making this to post some of my favorite songs.



I love this song"
"I could destroy you...but I choose not to?

Someone just blatantly lied to my face and it really put me in a bad mood because they tried to gaslight me, and have no idea the arsenal of facts I'm sitting on. 

Man, I wanted to unleash it all, but instead thought....""This is not worth my time, effort, or giving up my information sources."" So I just walked away shaking my head. ""You know damn well, it's true."" 

I'm holding myself back and misery loves company...hence the thread. 

Grrrr.....

I'd say I have these moments about 4 times per week."

"If you're an INTJ describe your appearance.




I'll start: I'm 5ft 4"" with long brown curly hair. I have hazel eyes and a nose thats kinda big. :crying: 

disclaimer: I'm probably stupid to ask this question because your personality type and appearance don't usually connect, but i'm just curious... :laughing:"
"am late for work but will edit later to insert all the tact.    general shot-across-bows for people unfamiliar with the recurring derails on the original gooey feels thread:

this is not a conversational milieu.   you're welcome to read, but it's important to understand that people posting here are not inviting a conversation about what they post.   and they won't welcome it. expanding here to say this should be assumed to include such one-on-one channels as private messages and comments on the poster's visitor wall. 

so if you feel an urge to advise a poster, tell a poster your own feelings based on their feels, think you know the answers or just generally have an opinion that wasn't asked for, please take it outside of this thread.  and even then, be aware that unless the poster has actually said they wouldn't mind being approached, the chances are still pretty good that you'll be crossing a line.  no matter how good your intentions are, no matter how much you feel like you'll die if you don't get to chip in.   

informal studies have shown that intjs (and for all i know other types too) genuinely appreciate having a place where they can express themselves without entering into some implicit 'social contract' that obligates them to put up with other people's two cents about whatever they have just said.  those who get it won't need that justified.  and those who don't can no longer say they weren't warned.

thank you.  i made minor edits to this, by the way."
"ENFP here.  Met this INTJ online and we clicked real fast.  The chemistry was instantaneous.  Then we started talking on the phone.  He used to call me every single day and keep me on the phone for hours.  He used to text me every single day as well.  I am suppose to meet him in real life later this summer.  In the beginning he was very direct and clear and said that he wants to actively meet and date me, and I concurred.  Two months into knowing each other, he sent me a heartfelt message saying he's never had a such a quick depthy connection with someone before in his life and how much he loves our connection, and he told me it's hard for him to say this to someone.  

However, all of a sudden he became really distant and stopped talking to me.  So I directly sent him a message and asked him what's up? Are you no longer interested or something? How come I never hear from you anymore? I even asked him on two separate occasions if he's seeing someone right now and he doesn't feel right talking to me, he needs to tell me because I don't like talking to guys who are already seeing someone else, and he said it's not the case.  He said that he's been working a lot, his living situation is hell, his back is hurting him, etc.  what is strange is that I see him logged on Facebook A LOT - he shows as ""active"" on my messenger app.  He sure is sooo busy! 

I'm getting honestly worried and anxious, and I'm not sure if I should take his word for it why he doesn't talk to me anymore.  We grew very close to each other, it doesn't make sense for him to stop talking to me all of a sudden.  Did I get boring to him? Why is he so quiet all of a sudden? What could be the reason? He couldn't get enough of me for two months straight."
"intjs whats your current short term goals,/hobbies/what things do you want to master or become good at?"
"I used to be very much into weight lifting. I have a sort of innate intelligence for it. My body is also naturally hypertrophic; I'm built like a caveman.

And it was my obsession until I had an accident preventing me from doing it (probably forever).

So I now work for myself from my computer indoors; I'm also accompanied by a host of health problems. I've set my goals towards chasing millions, but I realize this won't be fulfilling or probably even that rewarding.

This is probably the first time in 15 years that I've not really had some over-arching long term goal to propel me forward in life. I do have goals, but due to ongoing health issues, I can't consistently or reliably do them when I want to.

I find I'm interested in topics such as space, physics and philosophy, but not much more. As I see it, if I can't use my body then I can use my mind. And what is more interesting than trying to unravel the mysteries of the universe, understand existence, or encompass the entirety of reality in ones mind

Although the big problem is that my intelligence constrains me from actually pursuing these subjects to any level that is worthwhile, or any level that would make it feel fulfilling to me. I feel like I'm going through life running software that constantly exceeds my hardware's capability; there is a lot of curiosity and interest, but not enough processing power to actually run the program to a level that would produce anything worth running the program.

In other words, you really cannot do much in terms of physics or philosophy with an average or slightly-above average IQ. You just can't. People will say you can, but you really can't. You could spend years and years learning only for someone with an IQ north of 140 spending a month on the subject and completely blow you out of the water. And anything you achieve will be pointless in the grand scheme. You will constantly be fighting against the grain and hit your intellectual ceiling on these subjects very early. 

Since I lost the only thing I ever truly enjoyed, at this point I really only want to do something if I feel I can reach a high level of understanding and actually accomplish something. The monotonous daily grind of a full time job or even being self-employed and running some online ecommerce stores--aka being entrepreneur-financially successful still feels unfulfilling. But without a higher intelligence there isn't really much you can chase after that would be. This has led me to odd subjects like conspiracy theories, remote viewing, subjective-probabilistic theories of reality, spirituality, meditation, aliens, etc. But at the back of my mind, I know they are likely all fiction and I'm just trying to latch onto something interesting, fulfilling, mysterious, etc.

I've always been avoidant and disliked being around people, found friends who I actually liked still predictable and boring. Girlfriends and such are the same.

Ultimately when you combine this kind of mentality with an INTJ personality and all that comes with it you have a recipe for disaster. My Issac Newton type lifestyle would be justifiable if I had an Issac Newton IQ. 

It's gotten so bad I've been considering living in an RV next to a creek or a shack in the woods. 

Does anyone else feel something similar to this. Apologies if this is all over the place, it's very late."
"I'll tell you why. Because it makes groups of people feel good to come together in recognition of a mutual enemy. Regardless of whether that enemy is right or not, people will be their best selves, in the presence of someone who doesn't automatically support their miserable, day to day, worldviews and the morality of simple co-existence."
"Hi everyone, been reading for a bit the forum and wanted to ask as the title says for some advice, I hope this is the correct place.

So, I've been with my gf for about 6 months. For a little backstory, we met because mutual friends got to know each other. At first the 4 of us played video games and to get to know each other, and after that I added her to Discord.
We talked more and more each day and get to know each other, about our hobbies, what we studied and all that. During our talks on discord the MBTI was mentioned and she told me that she was INTJ and i talked to her that i had as a result INFJ/ISFJ (i'm more as a feeler but i'm not sure which one i am lol).
Eventually we get to know more each other and started to really like her, we get on dates and be more comfortable with each other. I noticed that she was very touchy, with hugs and kisses, and very open in our conversations and in person. 

We start our relationship and everything was very good and having a good time, but one time she mentioned to me that she was thinking on returning to her city where her parents live to study a masters and even more to ask if she could work remotely due to some problems within her work. I have to say she is very focused on that part professionally. I showed to her my support and that i would be fine even at a long distance, we planned more of our future as a relationship even with the distance and the hopes to move together later on.

But as the date that she was going to fly to her city, i noticed that she was a bit more distant, i thought that it was with all the things and changes to come and didn't show any concern I was still supporting her. 
Fast-forward, i noticed that she was more and more distant. We talk mostly by text but mostly phone calls or anything i was mostly initiating and that was starting to get me to feel a bit anxious and insecure.

I talked about to her the change of it, and she responded to me that she was starting to reconnect more with friends and her family, as well her work was starting to become more busy and appreciated the concern because she understood that she can forgot to respond texts or be a bit of absent on some of her friendships for example. I thanked her response and was a bit more relieved. But still sometimes i'm a bit frustrated that mostly i need to initiate the contact or to think that if i don't do anything or ask or something we wouldn't even talk or anything.  It's not just the distance but the connection that i'm a bit worried.

One personal thing is that my previous relationship was a bit unstable like discussions and be with the emotions all over the place and with her it has been so, stable? So am i just not accustumed and everything is good?

Would like to ask for some advice on how to navigate or be more conscious with her, what can i do more or do less?
Thanks!"
"Paul Atreides in Dune (1984 film) is an INTJ protagonist. He is INTJ in Ni/Fi sleep. He does also sound INTJ in the new Dune (2021 film), just guessing?

Dune | Official Main Trailer


ENTJ vs. INTJ training fight:

¬†





Dune - Paul Atreides [HD]





Paul Atreides as a Scholar archetype (The sleeper, Ni/Fi) with his father - He introverts his feelings - what he values and how he feels about it.

¬†





""Dune"" (1984): The Sleeper Must Awaken





Paul Atreides awakened - Ni/Te - He starts extraverting his thoughts and goes ahead to command an army and his true temperament then shoes up as Melancholie-Phlegmatic-Choleric (INFJ is not choleric in temperament)

¬†





Dune - ""The Sleeper Has Awakened!"""
"I was really interested to know to what extant the contrast between the INFJ's and INTJ's inferior Se reaches, since they're both the same in terms of the Ni/Se axis, but they have the small different between Fe/Te and Fi/Ti, so how would you describe your relationship with inferior Se?"
"I feel stupid, ugly, or at the very least mediocre. There are times when I skip class simply because I'm not feeling attractive. I'm in deep pain.

I can't bear to accept the idea that I'm not someone remarkable or exceptional; the idea that I may never be relevant in the grand scheme of things. It's been putting me off doing a lot of things, from working on my songs to attending college classes. My self-esteem is devastated, nothing seems good enough for me. I also no longer see the point in participating in college classes to have a mediocre job with a mediocre life. I really want to grow in the musical and artistic field; be someone inspiring and eccentric and disclose all my artistic potential.

Of course, I'm not going to stop doing these things completely, as I still believe in the possibility that I can create something beautiful and inspiring. I will continue with all my remaining strength to aim at intellectual and artistic development. But the fact that I am already 18 years old and still haven't done anything that relevant leaves me in a state of deep melancholy, since when I do, it will only be considered a ''good job for my age'', not ''a work of a young prodigy with great potential''.

How can I get around this inconceivable desire to want to be something so phenomenal that is making me give up on life? Does anyone have a point of view that might comfort me? Am I just in some kind of addiction or mindless pursuit of admiration? Or in terms of typology; Am I repressing my Se or something? a Ni-Fi loop perhaps?"
"I'm new here and I just read this somewhere:

""Clothing

There's generally two lines of clothing INTJs follow. One, mentioned on the INTJ fashion thread is largely utilitarian: black (or dark) t-shirt, jeans or cargo pants. For females minimal jewelry. Few advertisements. I follow this trend to the letter.

The few I know in reality wear light-colored clothing, but essentially the same thing every day. This light clothing is still cold colors (blue). Whatever the case, clothing stays consistent and avoids drawing attention.""

I actually laughed. That's like the opposite of what I wear. 
What do you guys wear?"
"Met an INTJ and the conversation went ongoing frequently. They asked me a lot of questions (mostly about my interests, what I do, etc etc) and I tried my best to respond to all of them.

However, they often suddenly changed the topic after I responded to their question and asked about something else about me when I made a comment of something like for example, ‚Äúright it‚Äôs so easy to do that!‚Äù
or just a remark about what they said like ‚ÄúI agree it‚Äôs so hard to do that‚Äù

They practically bombarded me with questions that it felt like an interview. After that kept going I answered another question of theirs and the conversation suddenly stopped there with them leaving me on read, so I freaked out wondering if I said something bad and quickly told them it was fun talking to them and they read that as well.

I know I might be overthinking, but I just got curious. Can you guys tell me general signs? Thanks"

The good deeds a man has done before defend him.‚Äù

"PLEASE HELP!! I WANT TO KNOW MORE ABOUT HOW YOU GUYS THINK!

We just reached a 1 year mark around a month ago. We are pretty compatible and happy with each other whenever we are together. We were in a long-distance relationship and I would drive to see hime twice a month and stay at his place over the weekend.

As of lately, we have been arguing a lot more, mostly when we are far apart and have to call each other. We argued mostly because I was anxious due to his texting frequency has gone down quite a bit since the start of the relationship and it concerns me that his feelings for me might have changed.

After the recent argument, he said to stop texting each other. He would like some time and space to think as he isn‚Äôt sure if we are right for each other or not and declare of breaking up but FOR NOW. He said he would get back to me but also said if I am completely sure that I want to know his decision after some time has passed, which confuses me with his previous statement of just breaking up for now.

I know for a fact that he cares for me a lot and so do I. After some time of contemplation and think back about what could have gone wrong, I texted him and tell him all of the things that I could have done better and offer lots of solution to accommodate his difficulty in the relationship, including moving closer to him and working on my anxious side.

We have a snap streak going on and he wants to continue the streak so we still sending pictures so there is still somewhat of a contact. We also still share each other the location. One more thing that I am hopeful about in this situation is that he told me he has done better in one of the aspect that we had problem out of nowhere. He politely told me again that he want some time and the he just not gonna forget about me so just let him have some space and is trying to think.

After I texted him all of the solutions and the fault that I made to him, I am not texting him anymore cause I already tried my best to tell him how we can work on things as best as I could. I decided to wait for him but I would like to ask everyone to understand more about the ambiguous behavior and do you think if we have a chance of reunion? I am also confuse if he still care for me so much, then why can‚Äôt it be a break but a break up FOR NOW?? Thank you for your insight."
