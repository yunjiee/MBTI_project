Post something good that has happened to you today, a week ago, 3 years ago - whenever.  It can be something really huge, like you just got married, or something that may seem insignificant, like you found an old picture that made you smile.  It can also just be about anything that makes you happy in general.  I hope this thread can bring everyone's spirits up!  :happy:

Here's my post: Today I got an email about volunteering as a Latin teacher in South Carolina over the summer, which I am really excited about.  I have an unhealthy love for all things classics, and I love working with kids so this is perfect for me.  It will also hopefully cure my restlessness from staying in one place for too long!

Bring on the happiness, everyone!"

"Heya Guys, I'm new here so a big hello to everyone out there! 

Well my story is a bit complicated and I didn't know to how word the title here. Essentially I have a best friend who is an ENFJ male and I am an INFP female. Now I know we're supposed to be ideal matches. The thing here is that we've known each other for almost a decade now (we were in school together), but eventually didn't see each other for another 8 years or so (yeah we didn't meet at all). That didn't matter to us because we were always in touch and stayed emotionally close throughout. We've been the closest of friends actually.

He was in a relationship some time ago, and honestly when he told me initially, I was kind of hurt (didn't know why). He broke up recently though. 

Then I got into a relationship more recently (with a guy who I think was most likely an ISTP) and that broke (a long story there too, which I will share if it adds anything to this), but essentially I ended up with a pretty broken heart. 

The person who knew about this and essentially heard me out and was really concerned about me was my best friend. Now we've had some history too because we liked each other in school romantically (but never did anything about it). We decided to meet finally some time ago and our first few hours were borderline awkward and normal at the same time since we hadn't met since school. We caught up on many things - talked about our failed relationships and our time in school. Then something pretty strange happened. We ended up kissing. He initiated it but it was very mutual. We just had this intense, unexpected chemistry. During this romantic time, we opened up more to each other. He told me he'd been hurt when I started dating, and he told me he somehow thought we'd end up together. Of course we shared a lot more stuff with each other too.

Now I've always been very attached to him and though we're very different personality-wise, we do understand each other and really like each other. We're kind of poles apart in some ways, but we do share some things that are similar. For example we grew up in pretty similar situations, so that connects us. 

However, since we've both been through bad breakups, we decided not to get into a relationship. It was a deliberate decision - we also ended on the note that if necessary we would keep the option of getting married to each other open (he suggested that. Both of us are not big on marriage and stuff). 

What happened was extremely sudden, and since my heartbreak was recent, I wanted to be sure that I wasn't just attaching myself to him. It's been some months since that meeting of ours and I realise I'm falling in love with my best friend. I think he knows this, but he has never been very expressive about anything. We talk normally, though he usually finds it uncomfortable to open up about what he feels for me after our entire episode. Is this normal for an ENFJ? He's absolutely caring though - he does keep in touch. He did tell me that he would love to relive our moments. He's kind of bad at being expressive in the digital world and he kind of switches off when I try to be romantic online. He was very romantic in reality otherwise. I tried being expressive but saw he's not really comfortable with it always. So I've stopped and I am treating him in a more normal manner - the way I did when I was a friend. 

It frustrates me that I don't know what he feels exactly. I actually don't know what we are right now. He means a hell lot to me and he's more open with me that he's been with anyone else. If I asked him to reveal his secrets, he would. I don't want to lose him and I've been looking at him in a very romantic manner lately. Just that I haven't been saying it. 

I don't know what he feels - so if there are any ENFJs out there, could you please enlighten me about his behaviour (keeping silent, not really discussing what happened, not being expressive fully). He did say he was confused about whether this meant if we were best friends or much more now. We're trying to push each other to achieve our goals now. I think I'm kind of paranoid about losing him in any way. Should I tell him what I feel or should I not reveal my feelings too much? Any advice here? I can't consider this a short-term fling because I honestly want something meaningful with him. I know he really likes me a lot, but after my breakup with the ISTP, I'm a bit scared of feeling too secure in these feelings. Not sure what to do. 

Thanks for your help!"

"So I had this idea for a thread a couple of days ago, and then today I saw @jonkay92 asking for one, how's that for synchronicity @AstralFlame? :laughing:  Anyway, after a very meager attempt at finding an already existing one, I was unable to, so I made this.

Pretty much what the title says, it's a dream journal. If you've had a particularly interesting dream, or a terribly mundane one, or just remembered a dream of yours in general which you feel like sharing, this is the place to do it! 

I've been trying to get into the habit of writing down my own dreams from time to time over the last four years, but I never manage to make it a regular thing. Hopefully this will change that, but it might mean that I'm the only one posting in this thread. If you don't feel like sharing your own dreams, but have some basic understanding of interpreting dreams, you can do that as well^^

Anyway, lets start this of shall we? 

Yesterday I had a reoccurring dream of mine. I'm being chased by a lion. There's rapports of a lion loose in my area, it has escaped from a traveling circus or something like that, and, being the idiot that I am, I decide to go out anyway. I never actually see the lion in these dreams, I just know that there's one wandering around, I even have a clear picture of what it looks like, even though I haven't come face to face with it. I'm just walking around, when suddenly I get the feeling I'm being followed. I start acting more and more paranoid as my dread grows, and eventually I'm running around, hiding occasionally as I catch my breath. This just goes on until I wake up... 

Hopefully someone else has a more pleasant one, so get sharing people!"
"Hi everyone, I started this thread to see if anyone knows what their Ayurvedic dosha types is.  I'm a vata and I know the MBTI and dosha type tell me some similar and also different things about myself, but both pretty much have me nailed.  I'd like to elaborate on my findings and get some feedback but first I'm hoping to get this thread going.  Don't know much about enanogram types but I'll look into it in the very near future.  If you have the slightest inclination to respond to this post then please do so.  Thanks."
"I'm so tired of hearing from other types that infps are bad at dressing up because of Polr Se. I recently saw a Instagram account of a fashion designer and it's called Swondine, I wonder if she's a infp. 

any infps here who are good at fashion?"
"I never gave much thought to the ways in which people manipulate. I might have fall victim to it, without even realizing it. I don't think I feel any need to manipulate at all. I might be wrong. I might do it without being aware of it. I guess I'm a complete nitwit on the subject.

So, what are the ways in which people manipulate? How do INFP's do it? Do they feel less need to than other types? Do INFP's fall prey to this quicker than others? How do we protect ourselves from it?"
"Hi guys! I registered here today, but I've been looking for information here often. I just want to talk about problems of infp 9w8 from my point of view. 

I hid my emotions for many years, especially anger. I met my girlfriend about a year ago. She taught me not to hide my emotions, and that was good...
But now I have become very aggressive! It's a big problem. I can't control my emotions. I am calm and peaceful often, but I get upset very easily and get angry because of it. I constantly insult everyone around me when I feel bad... 
I tell myself every day that I am terrible.  I don't want to hurt my loved ones... 🥺🥺 

How do you deal with your anger? I just want an advice 😣"
"it wont be as confusing as this first page, bc I didn’t know what I was doing when I first started this.

my views on politics, part 1



————————————————————————————————————-
POST 1

I’m using this thread for a few reasons.


One to share my ideas on God and how I come up with my thoughts and second, since this is a personality site, to show how someone with high intuition connects stuff and comes up with different ideas and concepts. How to see the bigger picture.  Hint: knowing the power of the question.

Of course, I’ll found that so many of my ideas I came up with all on my own, well it seems that somewhere at sometime someone has came up with it too, or piece of it. i feel a little let down and disappoinTed bc I like it when I thought up of something that no one else has but at the same time I feel it’s a sign that I’m on the right track, at least from the perspective that someone somewhere has had the exact same thought/concepts as me without ever been taught or directed in a certain thought or way, learning that I’m not the only one at random Kinda powerful sometimes.

————————————-
this Thread will be on going. Leave stories, connections or ideas if you want…but pm me if it is smth you want to discuss


——————————

in this thread I will give parts at a time of my ideas and concepts, explaining them also. I will also post stories on how I came to be on the road, my experiences, my interactions relating to this spiritual journey. The connections.

First, I want to give my personality type and some background so if you are reading bc you are  learning about functions particularly the Ni and Ne you may see the connections. Maybe?

Anyway,
I’m an INFP but my younger self was typed as INTP. I find my F vs T is very close. They still flip flop a little. However, my dom goal in life is to understand myself completely but I do this in a very analytical way which the whole purpose is to find the cosmic truth of human life And where/what/why/how I fit.  Which will seems very scientific way of looking at stuff, ….kinda at first, well you’ll see. It’s very INTP ….I use an INTP approach to finding my true destiny which is the ultimate goal which is very INFP. The intensive is so driven in me I really have no other real focus in life even as a child. ( well, I have a job and take care of myself,  love learning so I do meet a lot of ppl but this is always driven me, my subconscious never turns off looking for these answers.)

Also in my tri thingys 147 the visionary  …well my 4 is main.…my 7 is close with 1 and followed by 9,8 and 6 equally. I sometimes get 479

Also my sp is always equal with my sx….idk much about this stuff. But after discovery I’m a 147…471, the sx described me better with that tri-type

I take a percentage of my 8 functions about every 6 months. they are usually similar every time, a few very small  % differences.

highest to lowest( retook the test 2 days ago)
current.
Ni =80%
Ne=77%
Fi=76%
note…my Fi is usually in between the two Nx and they all always within 4-5% of each other, which they are all within 4% this time, too.

* update my Ne has been highest 3/11/22


ok, so I will start this with a video bc it sets the stage….I just found this video last week and didn’t know this about Einstein but Im definitely about the cosmos, stage 3. I knew he believe in a god kinda just didn’t know how similar we are in that way. Esp with the church god, for me, they offered no spiritual growth just dos and donts…anyway, this isn’t about tearing down anyone’s beliefs  ( as far as I’m certain, if what you believe in makes you a better person, makes you want to get up and live your life then who am I to say what is wrong or right for you), but I will probably mention my issues with stuff. this is just my theories.






I will try to write soon in the next post which will be part 1 of a snapshot on my view on god.

"Hello, fellow INFPs! I know this is not the first time this topic has been discussed here (or in Reddit, for that matter). However, whenever I read INFPs discussions about moving abroad, I don´t seem to click with the sheer excitement that seems to prevail there. This is my situation: I´m considering moving abroad and it plainly scares the **** out of me for thousands of reasons, and, I must say, I´m surprised it doesn´t seem to be the case for most other INFPs. Let me expand on this, first in connection to being an INFP and then regarding some facts of my own life, because I´d really love (and perhaps need) to get your honest feedback.

So, first of all, here we are, INFPs: we are intellectually curious, unbiased towards other cultures, poetic and seeking for deep meaning and fulfilment. Travelling might be our essence, in a way. On the other hand, we are also slow to develop bonds with people, need privacy and a cozy space of our own, and, if I´m not mistaken, some sort of stability too. For a start, the lack of these things when moving abroad terrifies me: no need to expand on the emotional bonds; about the rest of the issues, let me just say that living on my own has proved to be hard enough to achieve in my home country and it doesn´t seem to happen that quite easily when you´re an immigrant (and, in my case, don´t come from a well-off family either). As to finding deep meaning on the road, I tend to think about it as a double-edged sword, since the realist in me also wonders how much of your supposed enlightening time you will have to spend simply trying to make ends meet in an unfamiliar environment. Has any of you had second thoughts on moving abroad for any of these reasons? If so, how did it all turn out?

Some additional considerations about myself (possibly relatable to other INFPs too):
- Much as I love ""outward trips"", rucksacks and everything, I´ve found that they can be magnificent or trivial all the way. ""Inward trips"", however, seem less risky and more satisfying to me. For example, I could be more devoted to writing or other personal pursuits if I want a change in my life.

- My parents are 75 years old and my brother lives abroad too. Duty and guilt, anyone?

Finally, I haven´t stated why I´m considering moving abroad. The way I´ve written so far, it seems it´s more of an impossition to me, when it´s actually not. I´d love to have an adventure, study or work abroad. I´m ok with my job in my home country but growing slowly uninterested, mainly because I´m an English teacher for businesspeople and, I have to say, I´m pretty fed up with having to put up with sexist, classist and racist comments whenever I open up a friendly discussion in class. (Anyway, this seems to be a global trend, but I keep fantasizing that I may find a nicer idiosincracy somewhere). Also, the work market is growing worse and worse in my country (but then again, isn´t it more difficult for humans to get good jobs when every day there´s a new machine that sort of replaces us? I dunno.)

Sorry about the length, pals. I´m all ears.

P.S.: In case you´re wondering, New Zealand is the place I have in mind when I talk about moving, especially because of the nature there, because I speak English and because two of my friends may be moving there too, which really means something to me, since I´m so scared to kickstart this thing on my own. Believe it or not, otherwise I´ve always been very independent, but this moving-abroad-thing feels overwhelming to do  with little money and on my own."
"Dear fellow INFPs, what is the most important cause or belief you'd be willing to compromise or change for the sake of practicality or compromise with others?

At some point I am going to confess the danger of compromising a conviction."
"So, I get ready for dayjob in the morning, wife says I'm a grump and seem depressed. After I pack it in the end of the day and get a few minutes decompression, she says I'm the most joyful person she knows.

It's a coping mechanism, flip a switch try not to think of interesting things(outside of breaks), work to pay the bills, end of the day flip switch back and can relax. It is not completely seamless and there are bumps. I'll be out having fun, someone asks how work's going, suddenly the world's are colliding and my demeanor changes, and I try to avoid the subject. A lot of people talk about their workday, I simply don't, why relive it?

It is the only way I can find to stay motivated, is I get to take off that label, that persona, at the end of the day and be who I want.

So, I know its not a perfect scenario by any means, but is compartmentalization in general healthy? And where did I crossed the line to it being sort of Jekyll and Hyde like?  Does anybody else do anything similar?"
"I've found a good channel on YouTube that has some accurate insight to INFP types. Primarily because the videos are put out by an INFP. If you're INFP, see if you don't find some value in these."
"So we have a thread about our feelings, and a thread about what songs we listen too.
Lets make a thread about songs that represent our feelings.

The Rentals - These days. 
oo yeah, INFP goodness."
"When is the last time you felt like you were enough as you were?
That you weren’t fundamentally lacking something?
Why did you think that situation or moment made you feel that?"
"Hello INFPs and INFP forum.

I have some INFPs that I dearly love in my life, but a few of my friends and myself have been severely hurt by INFPs in non-platonic ways. I have identified a pattern of romantic destruction (yes I am an SJ) that these INFPs have committed in each instance to hurt me or my non INFP friends. Here they are:

Stating that they want one thing (ex: playing the friend card, the casual sex card) but really secretly wanting another. Ex: Secretly seeking a serious monogamous relationship, then being disappointed with their partner for not doing it, even though they did not ask for it, and did not clearly state their wants or needs. 

Saying they never loved or felt anything for a partner, but only at the end when everything is all over:
When the INFP says this, it usually causes their partner to further distance or to end things. The INFP usually denies romantic involvement when the relationship hits a certain pass/fail point that requires good communication skills, not passivity or denial. Why would anyone want to continue a relationship with someone who ""felt nothing"" for them? Seriously WTF!? For example, one INFP started referring to ""us"" as true love, and would always bring ""us"" up in the context of true love. We got together all the time, like every other day. We had been emotionally close for years anyway. However, six months later, at the end of things, I asked him if he ever felt anything for us and he denied it, saying his interest in me was only in a fascinated way, and never in a romantic way. Which one is the truth? What he said at the end, or what he said six months before the end?

Setting secret traps or hoops for the romantic partner to jump through:
If the partner foibles (like ALL human beings do), or if the partner does not somehow ""READ MINDS"" or magically infer how they are supposed to respond to each secret trap, the INFP is disappointed, many times going completely EMO. Yet the INFP does this all as an unspoken agenda, so that nearly EVERY potential romantic partner FAILS. It is like a secretive ""confirmation bias."" When the INFP starts looking for something to be wrong with their romantic partner that is not really there, they will end up making it happen. Confirmation bias is a law that you will find what you look for. If you look for red, or the letter A while driving down a highway, you WILL find it. Same thing with romance. If you start looking for things to be wrong, or focusing on them, you will make mountains of mole hills. Then after that the INFP can begin to blow off the potential romantic partner as worthless, or as non-relationship material. 

One example: At the height of the classic pass/fail point (that every relationship either makes it or breaks it here) the INFP tells me he will never have a relationship again, that it is too painful. So I follow his word as clear, literal, concrete truth, that he is not into me, etc. etc. Then when I tell him I am dating others and begin treating him as a friend, he decides to silent treat me. He then states he will be less and less available in the future and that is not apologizing for it. He then states we never had a relationship, yet at the same time, he treats it EXACTLY like a relationship break up, rather than a friendship. When said INFP says we never had a relationship, I take it as the clear truth, so I treat him as a friend. Yet when I do this, he gets disappointed in me.

My friends and myself have considered swearing off dating INFPs forever. We do not know of one who has had a lasting successful relationship. My friends began making bad INFP jokes about losing wallets, thinking weapons are flashlights, needing INFP enemas for all the shit they read wrongly into other's actions, etc.  So, why would an INFP say one thing, then turn around and say another? Why would an INFP stop seeing other people and commit to a partner because ""it would be wrong not to"" then later down the road, tell that person ""you never meant anything to me. I never felt anything.""

I can tell you as a sensor, if I love someone, I love them. End of story. If they hurt me, they hurt me. If there was something between us, then there was and always will be, even if it did not last. I would never wait until the end and say ""I never loved so and so."" To me, that seems extremely emotionally sadistic. Do INFPs pretend to feel? Do they pretend to love someone? Is this why they deny ever loving someone at the end?"
"Do you sometimes feel like you are being interrogated and that you're personal space has been intruded on when someone asks you a normal, harmless question or comment?  For example, in college, I had a friend who would always point something out about me.  If I got a new pair of shoes, she would say ""oh you got a new pair of shoes"" and then tell me her opinion of them.  Well, I'm sure to a lot of people this would just seem normal.  But for some reason, I felt like I was being interrogated and that my personal space was being invaded.  I don't know why I felt that way.  It might have something to do with the fact that I don't usually make casual remarks like that about other people and thier appearance of whatever the case may be.  I guess I feel like it's none of my business.  So for example, if someone I know gets a new hairstyle, I most likely won't make a comment about it, whether I feel like the hairstyle looks nice or not.  I usually just keep my opinion to myself."
"I wish women wanted to have casual sex with me. According to what I've read, women who say they don't want casual sex will happily ""forego their morals"" if the guy is hot enough. So I guess I'm just not hot enough. Which breaks my heart. I wish women found me hot.

Personally, if I was to go into a relationship, I would be more picky (about looks). More picky about looks (than I would be with respect to casual sex). You're asking me to devote my whole life to this woman? So of course I want her to be smoking hot. But if it's a NSA situation, then she still has to be hot (I'm still picky, I confess), but she doesn't have to be a total smoking hot babe. It's not like I'm gonna devote my life to her or something. It's just casual, no strings attached.

But according to what I've read, women are apparently the opposite. In terms of casual sex, they just want the guy to be hot. They don't care about personality. But if she's looking for a relationship, she might be willing to date an ugly guy, as long as he makes up for it in other traits.

So, as they say, any guy can get a relationship. But casual sex, only the really hot guys can get that.

I worry. If I ever get a girlfriend (probably too late for that too, anyway), then maybe she doesn't find me sexually/physically attractive. Maybe she's only with me for my 'sweet and dependable nature' or whatever. I don't get her panties wet, unlike those exciting, sexy bad boys she did casual sex with in her past. I merely appeal to her logic. I'm an apple. Nobody wants to eat an apple. Those muscular bad boys were her ice cream. Ice cream is tempting. It makes your mouth watery. It tempts your emotions. The apple does not. There's nothing tempting about the apple. But logically, you know the apple is better for you long term. So you force yourself to like it. But really, you don't like it. Emotionally, it doesn't satisfy you. It only appeals to your cold logic. Because the ice cream (the exciting, sexy bad boys) treat you badly in the long term. So you force yourself to buy the apple. But you really don't like it. You hate it. I don't wanna be apple zoned. I wanna be the ice cream to women.

And studies have shown that women are attracted to muscular men, with respect to short term flings. But in terms of long term relationships, they don't find the muscular men trustworthy. So they don't date them long term. 

I wish women wanted to have casual sex with me. Any old fat, hairy, muscle-less, jaw-less guy like me can get a relationship. But casual sex, that's another story. 

I wish women wanted to have casual sex with me. That's the only way I would feel flattered and attractive and sexually desired."

So the deal is: while I try to come to terms with my own issues, is this behaviour normal for INFPs? What's your take? I'm obviously not asking people to guess what he's thinking, but I'm very much confused."
"This is the long and awaited thread for non-INFPs. Ask us whatever you want to know or just come and chat with us.

We're very friendly!"
"I've been struggling with major depression on and off for the better part of 7 years now. Yesterday I had a particularly bad episode that came out of nowhere for no real reason. Even though I was surrounded by friends for Thanksgiving, I felt utterly alone and aimless. 

But then after I went home and checked my messages, I saw that my best friend from high school reached out about catching up. We lost touch because we attended different universities and her family also moved away. I'd forgotten that earlier I'd sent a message on our high school group chat about meeting for winter break and she must've seen it. She asked me about Italy. It took me hours before I realized why it mattered, because I must've told her years ago only one or two times about studying abroad in Italy. I don't post on social media and other people have frequently forgotten where I was. But somehow she remembered. 

It didn't matter that I spent Thanksgiving with friends when I could barely register what was going on. It didn't matter that the night before I went to a concert with friends who all seemed to enjoy it. But it mattered that someone who knew me well from the rare times when I wasn't depressed could keep track of something that was said offhandedly a long time ago. And this might not have happened if I didn't send a message in that group chat.

This tiny realization helped me feel a little less invisible, and I hope this story can help anyone who's been having a difficult time with mental illness."
"In one of my latest post I describe how INFPs have a special relationship with fiction.
We heal because of it. We love to invent imaginary world often very young. 
For exemple in my case I began to write when I had my first video game and start using Word to make original character at the age of 6. It was very primitive and a copy and paste of the scenario of the video game I played. 
It actually carry every thematic my dense alternative world now represents. Parralels World, love, existential problems, heroism... 

I know I create my world because things in my family were actually painful. I remember one time waking up with the feeling my family were robots. A thematic present in my writing. The place of others, determinism, virtual reality


Why specially INFPs? Thats the question I want to know the answer 
Are all FP inclined to like art/fiction?

It strikes me that fiction is present in all my life because I study a lot of psychology and it seems I dont make science like others FJs TPs. There is an artistic and aesthetic dimension but above all the role of fiction is actually extremely important. 
In occident science has been separated from fiction because we often say that reality and fiction are not compatible. But fiction and metaphor are linked. You get motivated by specific topics, it changes your values etc 

So why us INFP are linked to fiction? What can it represent for non INFPs?"
"Ive possibly made a fecking lot over the years, yet i sometimes wonder weather there is such thing as a poor decision.
Like do they  teach us something more valueable.
And even, was there really any other choice to be made, as in your decision was allready made for you, like some pre-determined fate.
In truth i havnt come to any conclusion,

So was wondering if any of you have some poor decisions/regrets you care to share.
Do you think they may have shaped your life in a more negative way, are they something you live to regret, or can you see a positive side to it, in the latter years.

I guess i will start.

When i was 14, a friend and i, had a small home made tatoo each by some other kids at school we knew, trying to be cool.
It was no big deal, just a small cross at the top of my forearm no bigger than maybe an inch. 
The following summer during break i got a saturday job with a friend of my dads, who was a tatooist,
Being into art, i loved it, i was just tracing out the tatoos for the customers and talking to them, it was a fun and  vibrant atmosfear.
By the end of the summer, the tatooist asked if i wanted a tatoo,and being young and stupid i thought it would be cool as feck, 
I asked my parents, my mum was rightly dead against it, but my dad said the choice was mine.
So i went for it, a tattoo at the top of my forearm covering the cross.
It wasnt something i really thought about, just picked something i thought might be cool.

Anyways im left was a four inch tatoo on my arm that looks like shite.
For someone who is very self conscious, possibly brought on by another bad decision its been a pane in my life, though now im much older i give less of a shit.

On the bright side, im ginger, and ye olde firey sod aint my biggest fan, so it dont get an airing that much

Still i havnt had one since."
"So I've been overweight for most of life and I've only realized the true root of my overeating, which comes from eating the food that other people would throw away to remove the burden from them having to get up and throw the food away and the burden of the Earth for producing food that has gone wasted(i come from a poor family and was taught this for all of my life). It's taken me years to ponder this and actually digest that my gluttony comes from a place of selfnessless. Ever since then, I have learned about fasting and have become comfortable with turning down food. I have also come to terms with my mortality and decided that one of my life long goals is to see my body in it's peak condition before I am no longer able to maintain it and or die(bye bye me). These thoughts have been pushing to have dramatic weight loss and now I'm daydreaming about building muscle as now I have turned being fit as something that was optional into something that is ""important"". I feel like INFPs would be attracted to the idea of having immense power and never actually using it (unless it was for protecting someone else) as well as being interested (both good and bad) of the feelings that are associated with building muscle, so what do you think?

Edit: Also, when I say bodybuilding I also mean weight lifting in general. I don't necessarily mean contorting your body into a super human shape for the sake of ""looking good"" but generally toning your body to be better than it once was."
"How do you as INFP present to the outside world?  Do you look “normal” - are you cold and serious or warm and friendly?  How do you think others see you?  Not sure what I am really asking, so feel free to answer as you wish.

I have watched several INFP videos and have casually known a handful of professed INFPs in my life, and it seems like all of them present far more artsy than me.  Like, they seem more like a softer animal-loving and poetry-vibing style.  If I didn’t relate so much to the description of INFP, in just a comparison of what I have witnessed in them, I’d say I am absolutely nothing like that in presentation, except maybe the looking up at the air when I talk.  Maybe I am just a more shallow INFP.  But, I feel like I look normal, even though I know I am not.  Lol.  Maybe I am also wondering how much of my INFP I have beaten out of myself, so that I can appear normal to everyone to glide on by and avoid judgment … it seems like maybe other INFP do not do that and are more authentic in presentation also.

Just some wonderings."
"It's a bit shocking to me how rapidly and meaningfully public discourse has changed in the past couple of years regarding unidentified objects in the sky. With the revelation of programs like AATIP in the U.S. and military sensor data being released into the public. While it's still unclear what we're seeing in the sky it has become increasingly clear that there is something actually being seen, it's no longer hillbillies and stories now it's military officers and civilian pilots with recordings on advanced sensor systems. 

  We've even seen the former head of the Israeli space agency come forward with some albeit fantastical tales, but I'm stumped as to what would motivate him to lie about this. Why would someone who spent decades as a decorated military officer and subsequent architect and leader of their nations space program burn their legacy to the ground? Though I'll acknowledge that his assertions are really hard to accept.

  Now we even have mainstream news treating the subject with some degree of seriousness for the first time since the sixties. 

 This was released just today I think...


  I have no idea what the ship recorded, but it wasn't swamp gas or a weather balloon, and if it is a drone who is making drones with technology decades or more in advance of the best the world has to offer? What are we seeing? And why has a government who has spent decades stifling an issue now reversed course entirely? Thoughts?"
"Before MBTI and enneagram, I felt both frightened and enraged by Te doms. After these theories I understand that they have tremendous energy, almost booming out of control in their bodies all the time. I cannot pretend to understand what life must feel like as a Te dom. Nonetheless, there is a degree of compassion when I see them relieving their tremendous energy in a burst of some inane sexual joke that is not funny, amusing, or even meaningful in any remote sense. It was just some excess energy that got spent. Like fart. 
However, throughout my life, I have also found myself at the receiving end of these jokes. I have tried to enjoy these. But they are so dull. Always around the same idea - insertion, penetration, opening and some ostentatious details attached to these so they sound less obnoxious than they are. Somehow, an idea of masculinity is also associated with these jokes but I don't see how. I use sufficient swear words in my daily life. I am not opposed to obnoxious language. It has an anti-establishment sort of a purpose. But I cannot forget that these very men who are pretentiously using this language are also thoroughly committed to the system. So, it does not bode well with me that these (not all Te doms, but the ones around me) people use this language. They don't have that depth. It's just that excessive energy that becomes so irksome sometimes. I can go snobbish about it. I can express my compassion in a cutting way. I have to try something. 

I venting here but if someone has some thoughts about this, you are welcome to respond. That's why this post is not on the vent thread."
"Hello all,

Recently I started a new YouTube channel called INFP Reflections. In it we discuss many topics that would be of interest to an INFP. Please subscribe and share your own world-view with us.

"Hi all electronic music lovers <3

This thread is inspired by  @hal0hal0 and also  @mysterie and  @mimesis - I think you might find this thread interesting. 

The topic 'techno' came up *waves at Hal0* and gave a thread about it some thought, have been dithering about how to format the idea in the first place(due to number of tracks allowed per post which I think is 5 max). So here goes a place to share with others your favourite pieces of electronica to keep it broad. Experimental, catchy, old and new etc. Post your thoughts and accompanying illustrations about the tracks you linked if you wish…

Just one thing - Please be sure to post your tracks in spoiler tags to keep loading times down. Many thanks!

Happy listening!"
"hi I'm bambi a female INFP and born in 1992  something just happened which gave me a fright and is causing me to go into a spin a little emotionally and I was hoping to check if some one could help

I found some one online by chance and without looking for him a little earlier in 2023 and I think he could be an ENFJ because he could lead with Fe a lot and we posted to each other about an objective area both care a lot about, and kind of clicked and over the months became close and although I couldn't speak for him I felt emotionally intimiate and a lot of feelings including romantic ones and I can't fully describe it but I truly really really like and care about him a lot

I found the person created a 2nd hidden page they were sending nice messages on, sometimes in the early hours of the morning, and they followed me over to another guy friend's page on the 2nd hidden page, kind of to note they were watching me and almost like they were a little terrirotial and uncomfortable with me being close to another male, even though I had a clear conscience wasn't trying to do anything crooked

I think the ENFJ knew I really really liked them over time, more and more, although I noted there was always kind of a hidden key I didn't know which looked as though it was holding them back, and I thought he could of been a little afraid but I just learned he is married as he noted in a post a little earlier today a sentence about 'my wife in 2022'

I feel 1st and foremost so bad and wrong inside for interfering with a married couple by accident and for trespassing against the ENFJ's wife by accident who I didn't know was married to him  I cried a lot falling asleep and today and feel a little freaked out and in shock and a little afraid of the ENFJ because I truly cared about him a lot and trusted in how our relationship was kind of unfolding and trusted all of the feelings I had for him

could any one have any notes or ideas who couldn't know us and maybe be outside of the situation about how I could be brave enough to come away 100 % and not be in touch with the ENFJ who is married, to help protect his wife

I truly feel so bad and all mixed up inside and ty for carefully reading and hope it could be better soon

a note: it's possible I couldn't have all of the information the ENFJ could know, and he mentioned his home was being sold and he was living with his dad a couple of months ago and was going through some things, and it could be he may of separated with his wife, although they are still legally married and maybe he hadn't noted it before because he was separated, although I don't know and am to afraid to say or do anything and feel like I cannot talk to him again because he has a wife and it feels unethical and I feel so wrong for tresspassing"
"Hello,

I am an ENFJ woman. I met an INFP a few weeks ago and it's been the most surreal encounter I've ever had. So many things needed to be aligned for us to meet and I just felt this huge attraction for him. I like to compare it to the Before Sunrise movie (and knowing they are both our MBTIs, it makes even more sense). 

I was traveling to another country, I was supposed to meet with friends for dinner. This INFP is also from abroad and he was meeting a friend of a friend that I was supposed to have dinner with. So we ended up having all dinner and drinks together. He didn't specifically look at me or interact with me even though he seemed to interact with everyone else. We are both taken so I didn't think much more than that. (Now looking back and reading about INFPs it makes total sense because he did tell me after, that he thought I was cute when he first saw me so I guess he acted this way on purpose). 

The night passes by and we end up in the kitchen talking. I start to feel a vibe but I just think he is a bit tipsy. He started to share with me his deepest thoughts even though we just met. At this point, I'm thinking he is cute and had the sweetest worries, I could tell he cared a lot about his family and people around him and I liked that a lot about him.

The conversation went on. I just really liked what we were talking about from religion to my relationship issues with my bf, I felt such a strong connection and I liked that he was so emotionally developed and empathetic, I've never met a guy like this. I could sense he was attracted to me because he became touchy and I just felt so attracted to him too. I never felt so emotionally connected with someone I just met.

By the end, we were just the last ones left, everyone left or went to sleep. The tension was REAL. He started softly by telling me that he was happy we met and how close he felt to me even though we just met but he ended up telling me how attracted he was to me. And after that, it's just like he had no filter, and he would just go on about his feelings towards me. I was so taken aback at how transparent he was about how he felt and I felt the same about him. Even though I think we both really wanted to act on it, we decided to leave it like this and not do anything because we were both taken. During this whole time, he was just very respectful. 

We slept one hour, had coffee together at a coffee shop in the morning while waiting for the others to wake up. I was wondering if I would still feel as attracted to him but I did, I think he did too because he seemed so nervous during the coffee and he would continue asking me tons of deep questions about life. I knew I was leaving the country soon so that was going to be the only time we would see each other. When I left, he felt distant and I guessed it was because his friend was there. And that was the one and only time I saw him.

Later on, I initiated a conversation with him on Instagram but after a few days, he told me in the nicest way possible that out of respect he will stop talking to me, that he needs to go back, settle and think about it. He said he's good in his relationship but maybe sometimes connection happens and we can't help it. I really understand how hard our situation is and I also need to process it on my side and decide what I want to do with my relationship.

A few days later, he unfollowed me. I saw him look at my stories once after that but not since. I later tried to guess his MBTI from the conversation we had and I think he's an INFP. It makes even more sense knowing that it's supposed to be one of the best MBTI matches for an ENFJ.

So my question is what goes into the mind of an INFP in this kind of situation where you are taken but attracted to someone else? 

Thanks a lot for making it to the end of my story!"
"The other thread gave me the urge to create my own video ... I'm working out the logistics of doing that/working up the nerve to do so in the first place.

Anyway, while that's percolating for me, I wonder if anybody else wanted to 'expose' themselves to their INFP cohorts? It should be interesting."

"I'm mortified. Two weeks ago I sent a long diatribe text to my friend-turned-lover (I'm 29, she is 30) after being triggered by her mean comment when we last parted ways. For context, we're both women (bi) but I was the first woman she's ever slept with. She has a boyfriend (I am not one to enter into affairs). We've been friends for 7 years but only recently became intimate. It was the most romantic week of my life. I told her I loved her in bed, and she touched my face and said ""love at first sight"". Then, she ghosted me. I didn't hear from her for four months. Then she came back into my life and said she wanted to be friends. I asked her if what we shared was ""real"". She responded simply: ""Of course it was!"" We met again a month ago (the first time in months) in an attempt work on our 'friendship'. We decided to go to a concert together. At the concert, after a couple drinks, she kissed me and said she needed someone to be assertive and ""fight for her"". We held each other with our foreheads together. It felt deeply longing/romantic. So fight for her I did. Just last week, we met for a glass of wine. She was talking about her boyfriend and their plans to buy property together. The last time we met she told me that she wasn't ready to talk about what happened between us. So I just had to sit there and pretend I was fine. I was in agony hearing it + uncomfortable pretending like everything was okay. As we were parting we got into terse conversation about how she feels I'm uncomfortable around her and she jumped onto a bus and left me in the street feeling angry and unheard. I texted her this (I'm mortified):

""You do know I’m in Berlin above all because of you right? Do you have any comprehension of how much I adore you? Perhaps I act forced or nervous around you because yes, you sometime make me nervous! I think you are trying to find excuses to put distance between us because you’re afraid. I also want you to be happy. Genuinely. If you’re happy with this dude, then I will shut my mouth and hold back my confessions of how much I love you. Because that’s how I show love — letting you be happy, even if it means being being demoted to ‘friend’. But you have to know once and for all, there will never be a day that I don’t love you. There are so many things uncertain in this life, and that is one thing I am sure of. I would give anything for you. I would give my life for you. I would have your kids, even it means I don’t have my own, because I can’t comprehend a world in which your life ends. You are the love of my life. And everyone can see it but you. Every time we part ways I long for you. It’s palpable. It feels like a part of myself is missing. And you probably haven’t read any of this because you’re going into dissociation mode, but, if you’ve only read this last message, the point is: there will never be a day you are not loved, so long as I roam this earth.""

She ghosted me. I know, it's over the top. Especially because she is avoidant. How embarrassing is this on a scale of 1-10 (disaster), and how can I redeem myself? I should preface this with the fact that I'm an INFP and MAJOR romantic. I love very rarely, but when I do, it's with everything I have.

**Edit: she responded with ""Hey. I'm not 'disassociating. But this is too much. I just see you as a friend. I hope we can find our way to back that friendship one day.""

**ALSO for context about the 'kids' comment  -- before we became intimate last year, I told her I would be a surrogate for her if she ever needed me to because she cannot have kids of her own. So the having kids comment was not totally left field.

Devastated is an understatement.  How do I redeem myself....I'm in so much pain."

"I have been injured so badly with antipsychotics and the treatment I have been given by psychiatry that I can barely even speak. The days when I was genuinely laughing, exploring the world at my own albeit very sluggish pace (later on) and feeling truly alive are so far gone now that it almost seems like they never happened, despite that they happened not that long ago. I’m not the first to wish that my linguistic skills would match up to the depth of the experience I am trying to communicate and I won’t be the last, but my inability to actually say what’s happened/happening to me is immensely frustrating.
So since I can’t spin a poetic or emotional yarn and explain myself that way, I’ll just have to say that I can no longer think, feel anything but emptiness, restlessness and quiet despair and in general I am not in tune with my senses enough to enjoy them. More or less, my mind has gone completely blank on antipsychotics. I can no longer picture anything in my head that isn’t severely distorted, and I have no natural running imagination like I used to. Once, I could lie down and entertain myself by allowing images to flow through my mind and by enjoying the feelings and thoughts that corresponded with them. I seldom pictured things that made me uncomfortable. Now, this never happens at all and I have to struggle to picture my mother’s face even. When I do it comes out disgustingly distorted and bearing little resemblance to what she actually looks like. 
Furthermore, I can’t speak to myself in my head. I cannot even say the word hello to myself without moving muscles in my throat or changing my breathing. That is, I have no internal voice. When I concentrate on my mind, all I get is pitch blackness coupled with the physically generated effects of my retinas and such. My mind makes no associations between things and in fact hardly generates thoughts about things at all. What I can’t understand is how the world in general has come not to realize how painful it really is to have no internal world whatsoever. Surely, I used to think, this must be an emergency of sorts. How am I supposed to relate to others with no stimuli of my own? How am I supposed to do anything? How is this even considered to be alive? How is it humane at all to force this wretched state upon someone against their will with antipsychotics as it was forced upon me? Surely I must have died!
I also suffer from movement disorders. I shuffle around a lot and constantly move my legs and feet. Most of the time I have no awareness that I am doing this. But this to me is sort of a trifling issue; I am much more agonized by the lack of content in my being. Simply put I add up to nothing, and I feel that I do. I just don’t understand how society can be so cruel like this. People think instinctively that because I have schizophrenia, that I must be seeing things. That I must have a life rich in experience if not in action. The sad truth is the opposite. I have no internal content and I don’t see how I could ever operate this way. 
My memories are also gone, for the most part, both long and short term. I can’t remember my past. It’s almost as if, as I’ve said before, the good times in my life never happened.
I just don’t know how I’m supposed to continue this way. Suicide is a very tempting option since drugs like acid that could maybe reverse this are illegal. Honestly, I don’t know if I should bother with that. It might be more prudent just to end it for good. I was afraid of being forced to take antipsychotics but I didn’t know they could do this much damage.
This all goes without mentioning how worthless of a person I am to other people now.
Please INFPs. Stay away from antipsychotics. If there’s even a small chance it could do to you what it did to me (and I believe there’s a large one), it’s not worth the risk."
