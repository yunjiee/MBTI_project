"This is to see what an ESTP would say... 

Random questions.  Dig deep.  


 Question1: So if I say I am going to go pimp slapping, what the heck does that mean???"
"Bart Simpson is supposedly one and James Bond, Elle Driver (Kill Bill), Krusty the Clown, Louie DePalma (Taxi) Vincent Vega (Pulp Fiction) and Sonny Corleone. 

is that all? 

who do you think are some fictional estps?"
"Allways wonder if personality effects the ""looks"" of one. So maby we should find out ^^

How do you look as a ESTP roud:















​"
I have realized there is no thread for this on the ESTP forum and am curious to see what everybody says
"I'm opening up this thread for those of you non-ESTPs who feel the need to create threads to bash the entire ESTP type because of your preconceived notions of what an ESTP is/are/will be. We have plenty of these threads but I might as well make this to save you all the trouble of making your own thread.


Feel free to complain but I don't think most of the ESTPs will care. Go ahead and knock yourself out, literally and figuratively!"
"I'm doing this for @Drunk Parrot and to build the ESTP community. Any ESTP that comes to PerC often feel free to introduce yourself. If your new, also introduce yourself. That's what this is all about. Introductions. From there we will build on a conversation.

Here are some Questions you can answer to introduce yourself:
1) How old are you?
2) Where do you live?
3) What do you do?
4) What do you and your friends do together?
5) What is something you enjoy?
6) You know you're an ESTP because...


Here is mine
1) 19
2) United States
3) I'm in college
4) We sometime just relax and talk. We sometimes party. But we always have a good time 
5) I enjoy eating, sleeping and anything exiting. I also like watching tv.
6) When I first took the test I got ESTP. It seemed accurate. I thought I was various other types for various amounts of time, but ESTP makes the most sense to me. The more I learned about the theory the more my type became clear."
"This question has been posed to me. Do ESTP have any fashion sense? My immediate response is no, but I think we possess what is needed to dress well and match colours etc... I personally don't really care much about styles or the latest fashions. If my girlfriend wants to take me out shopping for clothes and dress me up all nice then sure I will oblige, but do I need to go to RW&Co versus Sears? If it is just me shopping then Sears wins :happy:  I do look pretty good ini the fancy clothes though. roud:

This is a famous Canadian fashion designer and ESTP too boot.



So go ahead and give me your opinion on this subject fellow ESTPs!"

"ESTPs and INFPs - what is the lowdown?

Does it work? Does it make sense?"
"Hello ESTPs! In this video, you will learn how to use NT Sleep if you have it in a demon state. NT Sleep is a combination of two functions which is Ni+Ti. Personality types that can have demon NT Sleep are ESTPs, ENFJs, ISTPs, and INFJs. Learning NT Sleep is important because it will help you create an effective plan for yourself. You will also learn how to take calculated risks and reap the rewards from them. In this video, you will learn specific examples on how to practice NT sleep and I provide examples for each of the four types as well as some universal application of this animal. Watch this video here:"
"I was reading the profile of the typical sociopath and I couldn't help but to notice that some of the things on the list sound somewhat similar to some of the common ESTP personality descriptions


Here's the list

Glibness and Superficial Charm 

Manipulative and Conning 

Pathological Lying 

Lack of Remorse, Shame or Guilt 
A deep seated rage 

Need for Stimulation 
Living on the edge. Verbal outbursts and physical punishments are normal. Promiscuity and gambling are common. 

Callousness/Lack of Empathy 

Poor Behavioral Controls/Impulsivity 

Early Behavior Problems/Juvenile Delinquency 
Usually has a history of behavioral and academic difficulties

Promiscuous Sexual Behavior/Infidelity 

Grandiose sense of self-worth

Lack of Realistic Life Plan/Parasitic Lifestyle 
Tends to move around a lot or makes all encompassing promises for the future


Here's the website if you want to read the entire page
https://mcafee.cc/Bin/sb.html


I should mention there were plenty of other traits that I didn't add because a lot of them don't necessarily sound similar to the average ESTP description. So do you think ESTPs are more likely to have sociopathic traits ??"
"You'd be like what? ESTPs and self-sacrifice? ESTPs are the least sacrificing kind of the MBTI chart...

Well, yeah, technically.

But there is a surprising amount of examples in popular fiction of ESTPs who sacrifice themselves for something. Even in little things, but there comes a time when something just comes out of the ESTPs.

A hidden shadow maybe? If you think about it, it makes sense. ESTP's shadow are INFJ. And just as INFJ's shadow comes out every once in a while, the INFJ in ESTP might do the same.

Anyway, here are the examples.

Han Solo from Star Wars:

(technically, his Death Star save isn't a sacrifice, but still counts as heroism as he didn't have to do it, so it's also some kind of awakening of the INFJ shadow)



Steve Stifler from American Pie (the context being, he has to involve in gay sex to watch the girls' show go further and if you know anything about Stifler, you know, it's the farthest thing from his mind - yet, he's taking one for the team)



Mike from Until Dawn (this gets me every time) - there's a better version of this though I couldn't find:

(DISTURBING)



Seth saves Evan from Superbad:



And finally, Thor sacrificing himself for the weapon that can kill Thanos:



I wanted to include other examples but that's all I could find.

Anyway. What do you think?

My idea is that anyone with strong Se and Fe would be willing to be self-sacrificing from time to time.

(I might add, ISTPs do the same but in a less theatrical fashion. Think Jack Bauer, James Bond, every JB; Cooper from Interstellar who literally jumps down a black hole, or Solid Snake...etc)"
"ESTP's are amazing because...

Figured we needed some self-loving, as if we don't get enough around here."
"I just joined Personality Cafe and have been posting pretty heavily in the INFJ forum. Turns out I've been (accidentally, I swear!) kicking everyone in the balls over there! Kind of feeling like I don't belong anywhere, then, woe-is-me. The isolation of integration. Have any of you experienced this? Have you gotten too sensitive and poetic for your ESTP brethren? :laughing: Do any INFJs ever wander over here?"
"Is the answer a yellow brick road far far away?

And who is the mbti wizard who can grant me my heart"
"I'd rather not go into too much detail, but I had a falling out with an ESTP and was sure he hated me.  Well, we're back in contact now and he's acting the same as he did before.  I was just wondering how you guys would act when hurt, and if maybe this is why he stopped talking to me?"
"I was wondering if anyone has experiences of estps being shy and quiet types? I ask because I’m considering estp for my own type because in the past ive been exceedingly talkative, confrontational, center of attention etc, but I’m also very very shy and barely speak unless I’m in the company of someone I know well (and even then I can be mute) I also like my space and alone time and am quite comfortable being alone. I am also a highly empathetic person who never wishes to hurt anyones feelings, so I’m tactful, something estps aren’t known for.

SO, have you experienced a shy estp? Maybe with social anxiety or merely avowing a silence that is more comfortable to them than being boisterous and completely extroverted?"
"On all the personality typing forums ESTPs are always seen as the stereotypical bullies, mean jocks, or something like that.  Why is that?  Obviously its not true (I think every type has mean people), but why are ESTPs the ones who get that stereotype?"
"This is not a type thing, however, throughout my life ESTPs have always helped me, saved me and even push my limit at some point yet at the same time their generous nature and heroic actions are clearly something I strive to be. I can give lots of stories about the ESTP teacher who pushes me not to get spoiled and saved me from an injury when a ball was about to hit me. The man who fulfilled me (psychologically unstable and yet still saved me from falling off a bridge and life threatening events), the woman whom I admire that spoiled me with expensive clothes and lent me money throughout my childhood and helped my mother financially because we weren't so fanciful like the rest of the neighbourhoods but she manage to always give us these expensive clothes that I will never forget until this day. Uhm and also the bully, I do think he helped me (not really) but still, I think even if he was immature, there were heroic qualities that no one gets to see in him since he was misunderstood.

If there are stories about ESTPs that people would like to share, you may write them down."
"I know that in my experience, the ESTPs I am close with are always scanning people around them especially making remarks about appearances. It might be insensitive and triggering for some but I do find it comical and I would always giggle since you guys especially the males would always find anyone's weaknesses (anything that has to do with appearance especially) including to me lol.

Although I do feel stunned when the one I used to even went out with called me ""ugly"" as a joke or what I wear was ugly or said smugly with his mouth twitched slightly while holding my sleeve, ""You missed a spot there. This is dirty, not clean"" I do find it a bit blunt of him to say that during that time but it made me push my limit and made me aware of myself even better than before. 

There was one time when the ESTP called my dear friend, ""too skinny"" which she took it to the heart and I didn't like it that he said such a thing and mentioned about her body since she's insecure herself. 

If the ESTP knew I was chubby a few years ago, he would have probably called me ""pillow"" or a ""cow"" or something along the lines which might have triggered me a bit and lead me to passive aggressive behaviours and an eating disorder.

But well, now I do find it a way for me to improve and I love how the ESTP says it as it is which makes them one of the misunderstood types as well. 

I do wonder if any other ESTPs especially the males do this?"
"Hear me out my psychological kin, why don't we band together and like take over the world or some or steal a nasa rocket go start shit up in space or like anything on a world scale.
Oooor start a business with franchises all over the world sincer we.re both pablo Escobar, bernie madoff and the guy who saw the 2008 crisis coming and got rich while everyone got poor.
I believe in us guys.

P.S. I.m not suggesting to like rule the world, just conquer it it.s all good."
"Hi,

Finally know I am a ESTP. Thought I was a ENFP etc  etc. Freakin so I dont know intuition?. Too late thou 50 plus now.

What a bummer... but still lived as a ESTP.. Beer and all.."
"I've seen ESTP/INFJ relationships - whether romantic and platonic, but Im focusing on romantic ones for now - that have made me either BURN WITH ENVY at their ability to find the love and understanding that they have, the kind that makes me go ""That. Thats love. Thats what I want."" They just click and its so unfair to the rest of us rofl

ORRR

They have that relationship from the depths of hell which literally makes me FEAR love and go ""Yeah, love is bullshit, stick to the single life lmao, u dont need that heartbreak and pain"" LOL

What the fuck? ... Ive heard that this goes for ESTJ and INFP relationships too, in terms of opposites attract. Hmm should make a thread for that in a moment

Anywayz, What are ur experiences with relationships between ESTPs and INFJs?"
"I'm a 22 year old college student and an INFJ. I have started to get feelings towards my male ESTP friend and I'm not sure what to do about it. He is very outgoing, kind and always the life of the party. I feel very calm and peaceful when I'm around him because he is always looking for fun stuff to do and doesn't stress about life like I do and overthink and analyze everything. 

He's a bit of a man whore (not judging people who like to hook up live your life) but he has mentioned how he might want something more at some point. He's always been super sweet to me and gotten me out of the house when I'm in one of my what-is-life moods and I feel we really have a strange connection and understanding even though we are so different. He is athletic and outgoing and involved in so much and I'm kind of a cliche INFJ who loves to read and write and do artsy stuff (I do like to go out and live it up too but not quite to the same extent) :,) I love to think about people and feelings and can talk for hours about life but he isn't very into that kind of stuff and just prefers to stick to reality and do exciting things in the ""real world"".

He has flirted with me but I'm not sure if he means anything by it, we are good friends and he kind of flirts with everyone. I don't want to ruin a great friendship that has brought so much excitement into my life but I can't stop thinking about him and I don't feel this way very often... I'm just afraid if we start something he would get bored of me and leave me heartbroken and this friendship would be done for good. 

Do you think it's a disaster waiting to happen if an ESTP and INFJ date? How do you ESTPs feel about INFJs?"
"Ok, simply speaking it would be INFJ, however all of the INFJs I know do not feel like my opposite at all.

I clash most, or shall I say I feel most opposite with ISTJ.

Which personality would you say you think most opposite to you?

Why would you consider this personality as the opposite?"
"I get the feeling it's an Se, thrill seeking thing. Just wanted your opinions"
"I experienced different types of you all. Just truly admire the woman who is a role model to me throughout my childhood, the friend that works hard for his single mother, the bully that pushes my limit, the teacher that taught me to grow, and the man I dated with whom fulfilled me (sadly taken and psychologically unstable). 


Even the fictional characters that are my duals like Perry Miller, Georgia, and Oskar Schindler )

I don't know why, I just find your heroic actions so enchanting ❤"
I took the animal personality test twice and got rhino and tiger. Are those common to being ESTP?
"Basically I investigated who would be interviewing me after the recruiter gave me their names I looked them up on Linkedin

I showed her the women explained its two administrators in their 50s. I asked her if I should dress like myself in my typical business casual or wear ugly clothes to be more vulnerable looking. She said wear ugly clothes and not to dress to impress

So she found a sweater blouse thing that Id usually pair with something completely different. The sweater is perfect it makes me look larger than I am. Found some outdated but barely worn boots as well

Yes this could sound ridiculous to people possibly but I do not want to come off overpowering or too bold. 

We found the perfect ugly polished outfit for the interview. I will also wear my ugly glasses and put my hair in a low pony"
"I was thinking about how my oldest daughter grad party is around the corner, and is being hosted at her dads. Lets just say there will be some haters there. 

I told my oldest daughter that ultimately it was to celebrate her so that is what counts. But I told her I will feel sorta like a lone ranger in many aspects. While yes my family will be there etc too. My family is not all up in my shit like her dad and his family. And my friends of course will come yes. 

My daughter told me I needed to spell out to my two best friends that they needed to be on stand by and get sitter and actually be present not simply attend. She scolded me and said that people think I do not need support sometimes because of how I present myself. 

I think I do not want to get let down. I told one of my friends I would like her to actually come be my wing woman for the day fully attentive. I think it will really hurt me if she is distracted with all her drama."
"Personal growth with my dual in socionics is almost like a dream. After meeting such a person, I couldn't take anything in my life for granted anymore. I will let go of his flaws and not fuss over about it because he has the strength and abilities that I wish I had in me. Throughout our journey, there were of course challenges, misunderstandings, and predicaments that we experienced together. He did  things--but I believe there was no evil intent in him. At least in my eyes, he didn't. His actions speak louder than the words he utters.

He took care of the practical things, my needs and I offer him some guidance in life despite him being almost 2 decades older than me.

When I first came to this site, I was awfully bleak, nothing to move forward in life until I had to study abroad and met this man who made an impact on me. I'm not sure about him though, I wish I did make an impact on him too.

It was rainy that morning, the streets were flooded and pedestrians were all covered in coats and they were all firmly holding their umbrellas.
We were both standing around the corner of the restaurant, utterly puzzled since he didn't bring an umbrella while I did. I offered him to use it if he wants, but he refused because probably he didn't want me to share it with him. The streets like I said were flooded---I didn't trust myself since during that time I was wearing a long skirt just slightly below my ankles---so not for long he held out his hand to me and without hesitation I took it. We ran across the street, both held out our hands together since I trust him with all my heart. It was the thrill--for a long time I never felt so present---I'm grateful that my shoe wasn't really wet, however, he is the one who is wet. On that very same day, he bought an umbrella near the shops we passed by.... Returning to my place he advised me to buy boots to which I replied there was no need for me to buy a pair of boots since I have an umbrella. In the past he also tells me to buy many things which I genuinely think I don't really need honestly.

Anyway, I think it was one of those moments where I wish I can repeat it again."
"Just curious , what class would an ESTPs suited with ? Some says ESTPs are more of a warrior type ."
"Hi! At this point after lots and lots of thought, I have come to the conclusion that I'm a Se dom but problem is, I certainly do not relate to the Ni inferior. 
I can tell people's intentions, certain hidden meanings, can recognize patterns with a lot of ease and can also tell (not a 100% accurately but can) people's possible next moves and where things probably are headed. 
I'm not an Ni dom for sure since my accuracy is far from the accuracy of a Ni dom or aux but it's also very far away from a Ni inf.

Just wanted to know y'all's opinion on this. Does this seem possible?? Is there any explanation for this or am I simply mistyped?"
"INTJ + ESTP Relationships , Does it work? Any objections? How can i make it work? what sort of person would i have to be and what sort of things would i have to do to keep the ESTP extra happy?"
"Hello everyone. Hope you doing good.
Need your advise about my 5year relationship .
Im infp girl in a relationship with estp boy and we were living together the last months .
Unfortunately the last 2months i got into volunteer thing about strays and spent all my energy there . I had my job and at the end of the day o got no energy for my boy .
The sex got away. I was a little bitchy to him because of all the stress i was dealing with and things didnt go well. But we were ready to go for vacation and leave all behind whem somehting else happen. I reported to police a neighbor who lives near to his parents house because he has his dog always tight on a leash. Wont explain further. He didnt like that for many reasons amd that was the peack point to call out all my bad behaviours and the sex thag got away the last two months and he broke yo with me. He asked to pack my stuff from his house .


Today is the second day that we don't talk
I have moved to my sister. I told him so many times to give a atry and i wont do the same things . He says thay he wants his freedom and need time to find himself and he is sure that we ll be togther in 2 or 5 or 12 months. But he has break up with me again and he gave it a try  the last time.
What should i do ?? I really love him and i know i was bitch the last months


Should i give him time ?? He doesn't look good too
He told me he doesn't sleep well.
One day he had a hangover from many beers.he also started cigarettes again ."
"Hello ESTPs,

I am an INTJ and I have found myself dating my ESTP best friend. We've been best friends for years, and always had a mutual attraction, but one of us was always taken. 

My partner is very much an ESTP with one quirk being that he's learned when to shut his mouth and not offend people as much as some ESTPs. 

I'm very much an INTJ deep inside but with some ESTP nudging I become quite sociable and adventurous, and thanks to my ex I've learned to become much softer, more sympathetic and learned a lot from feelers. My N and J are quite strong (which meant when we first met, his dominant Se and my Ni made it a struggle for us to communicate, learning to communicate with him taught me a lot).  

I know my friend well though. He's never had a relationship last longer than 2 years. He has great intentions, and genuinely believes it is heading towards marriage, but he gets bored and can quite coldly cut it off. One of the (many) reasons he's attracted to me is that we go on lots of adventures. I know that adventure is important (and that is never going to change)... but what else can I do to keep an ESTP interested in the long-term? I'm secretly scared that once sex/touch becomes the norm he'll get bored and look around for something new."
"Im stealing this topic to Moxie (from ENTP sub-forum).

Link provided is Jung Preference Exploration Personality Test

Its having 144 questions, but I was ready in 7 min, its not as that hot.

Test offers your actualized type (who you are), prefered type (who you want to be) and attraction type (who are you attracted to).

In case you are lazy to do test, questions are:
1) If you werent ESTP, which other type would you like to be?
2) Who are you attracted to?

In case you arent lazy to do test: 3) Do you think that result correspond?"
Why??????????
"ESTPs and INFJs are so different. You guys are social bundles of energy, we are slothlike recluses.

"Hello ESTPs! In this interview, I got a chance to talk to all the ExxP types about their differences and similarities. During the discussion, we discussed what causes ExxPs to feel anxious and how that feeling manifests in their bodies. We also talked about the ExxP's IxxJ swing and what that looks like for each individual ExxP type. It turns out that ExxPs also don't like chaos and like to control things in their life. The only difference is when chaos happens or plans get ruined, the ExxPs can easily pivot to other plans or feel calm when chaos hits. Next, the ExxPs discuss their issues with over-gathering and what that looks like based on their type. This part of the discussion was interesting because each type tends to over-gather something completely different ranging from physical objects to information to values. We also touched on double observing or the lack of teaching/doing after consuming new information. This leads us talking to the differences between info-dominant and energy-dominant ExxPs. We then touched on ""people problems"" as an ExxP and what that looks like. And finally, we discussed Ti being annoyed at Ti and Fi being annoyed at Fe and even Fe being annoyed at Fe. Panel members were: Jany (ESFP Se-Te PB/C(S) FF), Tiana (ESFP Se-Fi CS/P(B) FF), Shane (ESTP Se-Ti CP/B(S) MM), Ian (ESTP Se-Fe PC/S(B) FF), Jacob (ENTP Ne-Fe PC/S(B) FF), Jake (ENTP Ne-Ti CP/S(B) MM), Annie (ENFP Ne-Fi CS/B(P) MF), Ashli (ENFP Ne-Te PC/B(S) FM) for the first hour and me (ENFP Ne-Te PB/C(S) MF) for the second hour.
