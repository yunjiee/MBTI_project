"Alright! It's high time for us to have this thread. Even the ESFJ's are ahead of us! :tongue:

I guess I'll start... I hope they are accurate enough...

You know you're an ISFJ when...

-you say something humorous to a person, then worries how that statement might have the hurt the other person, causing you to apologize to the bewilderment of the other.

-you work on a project and finish it, but it's not perfect enough!

-you get flustered when a person commands you to ""Speak Up"" :angry:

-even constructive criticism hurts :frustrating:

-you get attached to a person after around two weeks of getting to know each other, and when he/she has to leave, you cry heavily."
"Another PerC member suggested that we should have an Introduction Thread in the ISFJ forum. I thought it was a great idea.  It seems like there are a number of ISFJs who look at our forum and just lurk because they don't feel comfortable posting.  Being a shy, sensitive ISFJ type myself, I can understand what that feels like.  But my favorite thing about the ISFJ forum is that it's such a warm, welcoming place...I feel like I can post anything and feel ""safe""

So I figure this can be a formal place where some of the more frequent ISFJ posters can share some things about themselves, and maybe it will help give some new ISFJs a starting point too.


So here are a few general questions for ISFJs to answer.  Don't feel like you have to answer all of them if you don't want to, and definitely feel free to share or add on anything else you want.  I just thought maybe this could be a starting point.


1.  What's your age/age range?

2.  Where are you located? (City, State, Country, Region)

3.  What's your current occupation/job/career?

4.  What's your current social situation (married/relationship/single, or can name family/friends/pets too).

5.  What's something you're interested in or like to do?

6.  What's something that you really like about yourself, especially as an ISFJ?

7.  What's something that you find tough about being an ISFJ?

8.  What's something quirky/interesting/unique about you?



I'll start!  Here are my answers:



1.  I'm a 32 year old male ISFJ.

2. I live in North Carolina in the southeastern United States.

3.  I teach high school math.

4.  I'm single and gay with no pets, and I live alone.  I have some very close friends and family members that I love deeply, though.  


5.  I like to go hiking, play video games, watch movies, watch lots of sports, play pool, gamble, and travel.

6.  More than anything, I'm a super loyal person to those that I care about. I feel like I'll stick with them to the end.

7.  I over-worry about things too much, especially when I have no good reason to.


8.  I still have my childhood teddy bear (he's in my avatar).  I've loved him since I was a kid, I still like to cuddle him, and I sleep with him every night.  




See, not too hard, right?  And if I can admit that I'm a 32 year old man who still sleeps with his teddy bear, I know you ISFJs can feel comfortable sharing anything about yourselves!"
"Aka the stuff you are thinking but normally don't share with the world.

I'd really like a place where we can post any and everything we want/ feel/ think and get feedback from our fellow ISFJ's. Or even just a place to vent. Besides, everyone else has one 

Go!"
"I created this thread as a place for us ISFJs to talk about things that interest us.  Things you can talk about:

- Share a fantasy world.  Ex. Talk about a special town or a whole empire.
- Talk about world issues and what should be.
- Video games.
- Interesting facts.
- ""What if everybody...?"".
- Music.

I'll start off.

I like aviation a lot, especially when I was in high school.  At the end of high school, I was hoping to get a pilot's license.  I forget why I didn't do that.  Perhaps the volunteer work I got involved in?

Anyway, I like gyrocopters:


























I like how they are capable of flying, without any power to the rotor!   The rotor is driven purely by the wind!  All that energy stored in the spinning rotor can do amazing things equivalent to helicopter maneuverability.

Go ahead and comment or talk about whatever is of interest."

"Alrighty so my brother was telling me how there is a photo thread over at the INFJ forum, so I figured I might as well make one here since there isnt one (as far as I can tell)."
Im an social outcast and always have been. There is no two ways about it when I say Im definitely introverted. I suffer from social phobia and selective mutism . I enjoy the solitude of being by myself some days but feel very very alone on other days. I dont feel like I really fit into society. I have very few if any good friends outside of cyberspace. I have never been in a relationship (serious or casual for that matter). Dating and finding somebody to spend the rest of my life with seem to be pipe dreams that are out of my reach at this point. Im very prone to feeling depressed and lonely. In the past I have thought about ending my life because I hurt so much on the inside from being such an outcast from society. I can speak freely online and socialize with people. The one thing I long for the most is human touch. Talking to people online isnt the same as having an heart to heart in person with them. There is almost nothing I would not give for the opportunity of cuddling and snuggling up to a person. I just want to love and be loved. Can any of my fellow ISFJ's relate or am I just the exception to the rule?:sad:
"Most people probably don't think that commonly seen traits in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are very similar to those of an ISFJ.

However, the description fits me to a T - especially the range of jobs (they are all ones I've either wanted to hold at some point in my life or have held).  I am a social worker.  As a child and teen I dreamed of being a doctor, and have previously worked in customer service/health administration as an adult.

I am a 30 year old married female who was diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome at age 25.  While I had received various mental health diagnoses and was on medication from the age of 14 on, I didn't find out what was really up until I got my diagnosis.

Here's the irony:  I obtained a Master of Social Work due to my interest in social justice and political activism.  I graduated in 2010 and was unemployed/severely underemployed (very part time retail) for 13 months.  The diagnosis came about as a result of a worsening mental health issues during that time.  Part of the goal of my diagnosis was to help me find out more about what I could do as a career since social work wasn't working out.  However if you are familiar with ASD then you probably know that its defining characteristic is perceived by many to be a marked lack of empathy - so I began to look for completely different types of jobs (courtroom stenographer was one I seriously considered) while feeling bad about not being able to ""use"" my credentials.

During that time through my fianc√© (it's always a connection!) I got a job as a receptionist in an agency that provides therapy to children with disabilities such as ASD.  In the over a year since I got there, I have been able to start receiving therapy and am seeing several specialists for my medications and the health issues that followed me from that dark time of unemployment, trauma from a year and a half spent working for a horrifically abusive dentist boss and years of improperly treated mental health issues.  This has enabled me to be promoted to a role performing initial assessment and intake for families seeking services at our clinic - I excel at it, am inspired every day, have great working relationships with colleagues and I am finally ""using"" my education.

This post is starting to feel self-absorbed, so I will stop now.  

Please share your thoughts on ISFJs and Autism"
"The difference between ""nice"" and ""kind"" would be that ""nice"" is something you do for politness while actually follow only your interests without considering other people, while ""kind"" is when you're genuinelly good, empathy.

Of course I don't mean to say that ""all ISFJ are nice not kind"", but I've seen plenty of talks in this forum about ISFJ's... lack of morality. Basically is just them in the world, they are the only person that matters, and they don't care if they would get anyone else's feelings hurt as long as they are being nice.

And I've had this experience with 2 ISFJs myself, they both seem nice people and all, but they kind of lack... kindness, or integrty. They would fit all ISFJ's common stereotypes as very Si's meticulous, Fe's politeness and dead scared of change or new things inferior Ne, basically a pleasant atmosphere and in a way they're kind of making sure they're making a pleasant atmosphere. But that's about it... just surface.

Down deep, they're not good people, they lack integrity. ""Doing the right thing"" for them is just ""the selfish ends justifies the means as long as you're being polite"", you can even starve a whole town in africa if you're doing it in a polite way (ok, that was an exagerated example, but it's about the point).

They do care about their family, the other ISFJ is a member of my family, a lot kind of, but if you're outside their family, I have bad news for you... you're going to be used when necessary and it doesn't matter if you get a bad deal, they don't give a damn about your feelings unless you're part of their family.

The general lack of integrity ""as long as it's polite it can't be (morally) bad"", that was the general menality of both ISFJs, and they genuinely believe that.

This is sort of a person I would call a mastermind. Someone who's being so nice to people yet so basically selfish in their interests. Don't care about others' well-being just theirs while showing a nice facade. And well... to those ISFJs that was it, it doesn't matter if you're hurting people, are keeping people cofused, are making people lose material assests, are double-crossing people, as long as you're doing it nice you're ""morally clean"". But the thing is, they actually believe they are good people while being just nice, is not a fake for them.

I was surprised by this, as initially as I've red about ISFJs I've heard they are the 'nurturing' type, but that nurturing is kind of limited to family only. I was even more surprised they they don't believe themselves as ""evil masterminds but in fact are very proud of this, they think they are very good people for being nice all the time like that, and the world is full of bad people who just aren't nice."".

I litterally heard ""a nice lie is better than truth"" from the one in my family, yes there are situations where you have to lie... and there are situations where you like to gain some advantages while someone else has to suffer being of your lie, it was the second case. I'm not sure you can expect integrity from them. I thought it's just a case, but I've seen plenty of similar cases on the forums, not that all types are clean just that ISFJ seem to dominate this ""nice but not kind"" thing.

But a strange thing. Dispite their lack of genuine morality. You're being good with people, people are being good with you; people are not being good with you, you have no moral bound to them. They do have a ""niceness morality"". You're being nice to people, people have to be nice to you or else they are assholes; people are not being nice to you, you were wronged!

So... obviously I didn't came here at the ISFJ forum to talk bad things to your face. I genuinelly want to know if that's typical ISFJ behaviour.
Do you really think that for exmple if you say ""fuck you!"" to someone in a nice way  you're morally clean ? or does it make it worse ?
Is that a typical ISFJ behaviour I described above or is it just unhealthy ISFJ ? If so, how does healthy/unhealthy ISFJ manifests and why ?
What would make an ISFJ turn from healthy to unhealthy, and how can he be helped to be healthy ?"
"ISFJ is 35 and male and I'm 29 Female INFP. I know this forum isn't used that much anymore but insight from any personality type is okay.

I recently started dating an ISFJ, he was quite passive and at times I didn't know if he was into me. I felt like I was putting in most of the effort. But when I asked he said he was interested in me, he said he just wasn't good at conversation but he was always there for me and was happy with me.

However a month or so ago we had a falling out and he wanted to end the relationship, I asked for another chance and said I'd change the things he didn't like. The falling out happened because I was quite over emotional and I told him I was hurt and felt rejected because he hadn't opened my message in 24 hours and I was worried something had happened to him. Anyway things went back to normal.

Then a week ago I had a hospital stay. Despite being near the hospital, he didn't visit or call or text. 4 days went by and I didnt hear anything from him. I confronted him, then I lost my temper, saying I wanted a boyfriend who remembered I existed. A few hours later I sent a message saying that I cared about him, but I felt there was a lot of problems we needed to overcome, and if he was willing we could do it.

He read the message but its been 5 days and no response. He has never left me on read before. In the past, when we would argue, he told me that he would wait a few days for me to calm down. But during that time, I was always the one to reach out. I don't want to do it this time. I miss him so much but I feel like I can't message because it was me that sent the last message and he didnt respond, I don't want to cross a boundary if he doesn't want to talk, and I dont want to force him. We have very different thinking and processing styles. I wonder if he will ever message me again or move on? im quite clingy and anxious but he's very independent and dismissive. Usually he just moves on. 

We haven't technically broken up, other than I said I was going to find a boyfriend that cares about me. But feel like there hasn't really been any closure. I feel uneasy just...never talking again....

I was hoping he'd think about things and approach me, but it doesn't seem likely. im just wondering if its likely he will ever get in contact again or should I just move on? I really liked him so its quite hard."
"Has anyone met an isfj with avoidant attachment? I am dating an isfj, we get on well until there's a problem and I try and discuss it. For example when I was in the hospital he disappeared for 4 days and didnt contact me. I eventually asked why he did that and he kept giving me excuses. He often disappears and gives excuses. When I try and discuss something he sees conflict and avoids. He can't answer or solve an issue and just tries to end the relationship or ignore me. The other thing is that he has no friends and spends all his time alone or overworking. He acts very nice on the outside but always feels distant and uncaring. He cuts people off as soon as they get close and prefers to rely on himself. im beyond frustrated by it but I rarely see any posts about avoidant isfjs."
"I met an ISFJ on an app. I'm an INFP. We mostly took it In turns to initiate. Met up a few times and messaged everyday even if it was just a few messages.

Then at one point he got sick, I checked in on him but gave him some space because he was sick. I didn't hear from him in a few days and sent a message to ask if I'd done something wrong. He responded that I hadn't done anything wrong, he said I could text him whenever I wanted and that he would too (but he hasn't). Conversation went back to normal but it was me initiating all the time. I decided to stop, its been 3 days and I haven't heard anything from him. 

I don't want to reach out again in case he found someone else and lost interest in me but is too afraid to say. Although he's always been a shy overthinker, I'm not sure why he suddenly stopped initiating. I'm really hurt to be honest.

The first time it happened I expressed I was hurt that he'd gone cold, he said he was just being cautious. I'm worried we are just never going to talk again. I'm left just wondering what happened and wondered if any isfjs could give me insight."
"I'm a 25 year old INFP currently living with my parents because that's how it kind of is in Korea. I've been job searching for a while now, and it has been a really difficult time. I've been really stressed and most of the time, try to just stay in my room and work on my job search. 

Now, with my mom. I have always found her somewhat difficult since I was little. She's funny, friendly, and incredibly outgoing in social situations. She's also very caring to me and my brother, shows a lot of love, works way too hard on house chores. But she also has weird mood changes and can be quite rough on us. I often feel like I have to walk on eggshells around her because of having to predict what mood she's currently in. She's kind of the type who complains about me not helping out at home and that she has to do everything (even though I insist on helping and do chores, but she keeps on telling me not to), but when I do help, she complains how it's not up to her expectations. She always says, ""I should've just done it."" This really annoyed me for a while but I think she knows how much I'm trying and how I'm not just ""sitting around"" and not helping her out. She hasn't really complained about it nowadays. 

But her mood changes stress me out the most. She seems fine and friendly, laughing and joking around with me one day, and then the next day, it's as if she's mad at me about something. I don't know if she's actually mad, but the way she talks to me sounds kind of..indifferent. Or like she doesn't want to deal with me so she tries to not talk to me. It drives me crazy and I find myself crying often because I don't know how to deal with it. I can feel the room so much that I can just feel when something's off. It's like that right now. Yesterday she sent me a bunch of funny videos while I was out, and today she barely looks at me or talks to me. Why does she do that? I know ISFJs also need some alone time and space, but I feel like an idiot for even trying to alleviate the atmosphere. I feel like I'm going crazy because I keep wondering if it's just me, or if it really is her mood swings. If she's not happy with me, I know it's because I can't find a job yet. I'm stressed out too and really getting into that depression hole, but I'm trying every single day to send in applications and go through that tiresome process. I wonder if she actually thinks I'm doing nothing and just hanging out in my room all day. 

How do I deal with this? Is she just tired and needs alone time? I wish I were less sensitive to her mood changes, but I can't. I just have to wait and see until she begins joking around with me again."
"How do you think ISFJs would be in the military? 

Personally, I think some ISFJ attributes may help us out in the context of the military. I've never really wanted to do it, yet I haven't been totally against it (unless you go to war!!!). Plus, I was always pretty bad in gym class except in high school when it was ""an A for effort"".   Any ISFJs from the military here or thinking about it?  Is it even an option or was it ever an option?"
"Hi there, everyone. I'm Billy and I'm an ISFJ with ADHD. I was wanting to know if there are any other ISFJs with adhd? Any comments would be very helpful.:happy:"
"I just made this thread about birthdays:



http://personalitycafe.com/cognitive-functions/83058-si-fe-birthdays.html#post2049260




I was curious to see what other ISFJs thought about the topic.



I've heard other types say that SFJs  are really big on birthday celebrations because of the ""tradition"" involved.  This makes sense due to Si and Fe.


But for me, this plays out in a different way.  I don't think a birthday should mean someone has to have a big party.  However, I do think that there's an unwritten, social rule that a birthday is one day where someone should get whatever they want, even if it goes against traditional celebrations.



So my Si and Fe lead me to have this belief that has no real basis in logic, but is also not the conventional way of looking at birthdays.  



I was curious to see how this compared to other ISFJs."
"[this is so long.  I am sorry.  I tried to be concise, but... all the feelings...see tl;dr at the end...]

I am a pretty true-blue ENFP (with some J tendencies in work environments), including the lovely ability to feel ALL THE FEELINGS and express NONE of them, especially when I may be slightly paranoid that expression of said feelings will not be well-received or may do more harm than good - I don't worry so much about being judged for my choices or actions, but I do worry about how my feelings and their expression affect others and how they feel about me. (if you're wondering what makes ENFPs hard to read... that's what it is...) 

I have had relationships with men all over the MBTI spectrum, but vast majority NF or NTs, which also represent most of my friends.  So this whole SF thing is... new territory...

I am now in a fairly new dating/not-yet-committed relationship with a man I VERY strongly suspect is ISFJ - he is a self-described introvert and ""good listener"", remembers details, has a lot of routines, is a dad and clearly has a very strong sense of duty toward his child (does very intentional and thoughtful things for him), has had the same stable job for over 5 years, stubborn, values tradition and close friendships, etc.

He was very forward and affectionate for the first couple of weeks/dates (daily contact from the beginning), and we had a fantastic connection and chemistry with lots of shared values/goals despite our very clearly opposite personality traits (which I can already see as complementary/balancing), and then a tragedy in his close circle of friends required some shuffling/uncertainty of dates during the third and fourth weeks, and he suddenly seemed quite distant, though at one point he - in a frustrated-but-trying-to-stay-teasing tone - informed me that I should ""act like I liked him if I liked him"".  I was confused, because I could tell he was being distant, though figured he surely was still interested if he wanted me to ACT interested, but couldn't figure out why if that was true he was being distant in the first place, and then the distance persisted even as I reached out more.

Finally, it all came to a head, and through a very direct conversation about feelings on both sides, I had the massive AHA! moment when he said that he thought I cared, and because I cared, that I would reach out frequently to check on him after the tragedy struck, and then I didn't, and then when he told me to act like I liked him if I did and I - in a moment of confusion and paralysis of fear on being asked to actually express emotion directly - squeaked out something like ""I was trying to play it cool?!  I REALLY LIKE YOU"", he was completely thrown off because he read that as game-playing (rather than just my own insecurities) and so he had been acting distant because he felt distant and uncertain and oh I never explicitly thanked him for dinner (true story - when I like someone my brain completely freaks out at the end of dates and I have no idea what I say and often realize like 3 days later that I didn't say thank you and feel terrible and embarassed but have always hoped that no one noticed...)... oof.  Miscommunication central.  

(Meanwhile, in ENFP girl-land, I was trying not to come on too strong despite being totally smitten and trying to respect the fact that I've only known him for a couple weeks and so he probably doesn't want ME to be the person trying to reach out and support him because I care about him but I'm not his girlfriend so I will just give him space to process the tragedy and let him show back up when he feels more stable and...wait where is he?)

So after we have this conversation and figure out that both of our interpretations were just TOTALLY OFF (I care very much and thought I was being caring by not pushing him to communicate with someone he barely knows during a very personally sad time, he is distant because he is feeling hurt and unappreciated, not disinterested), I very timidly asked about moving forward and if these things are dealbreakers (and was certain he was going to be like, ""ugh, this is way too hard, no way, have a nice life""), and he was like ""What? You're great. Of course I want to see you again."". OH. OKAY. YAY!  So. We're moving forward, and have explicitly stated that our goals are ""simple, honest, and fun"" and that when I am feeling something, I will share it (which is, like, totally terrifying but also, you know, healthy...).

It wasn't until after this conversation that I started hunting around for his MB type (he didn't know it when I asked him about it on our second date), and when I read the ISFJ description, literally everything about what had happened became so clear, and it was like there was a spotlight on all the ways I had acted exactly OPPOSITELY from what he would have interpreted as ""totally interested and caring"" (and why I misread his cues as well).  The irony being (cue O'Henry...) that if I had just openly expressed my feelings - which, given my all-or-nothing nature, are typically considered ""a bit much"" by most - and texted on the regular when I was genuinely thinking about him, and stopped panicking about what he thought about me so much I lost all my manners, the miscommunication would have been solved.  (He also could do with a little feeling-sharing, but I know he thinks he was - and he technically was - it was just that I didn't get what the cause of the feeling was...)

One challenge: I'm going on vacation, and our schedules don't line up this week, so we won't see each other for like... 2-3 weeks (and the feelings conversation was by phone).  Which at first made me anxious, because I feel like we're going to lose all this momentum, but instead I am trying to see it as an opportunity to build a better foundation.  Therefore, I come humbly to you all to ask...

1) Does my overall interpretation of him as ISFJ seem accurate?

2) We have not had a conversation about commitment, though I get the sense that what he would really like is what I might consider closer to ""girlfriend-level"" communication, despite not having had that conversation.  (this is not an issue for me - I am certainly not dating anyone else - and fall heavily on the ""loyal, dedicated, and terrible at leaving bad relationships"" side of the ENFPs, rather than the ""grass is greener"" syndrome - and I think if we had seen each other this week/next week, that conversation would happen once we actually had interaction beyond the feelings talk and both felt like the decision to move forward was the right one, just... timing...).  But it still is counter to, like, the majority of dating advice to be constantly reaching out to a man who hasn't made an explicit commitment (I actually said something like this to him - that I didn't know him that well yet, to know what he would need in a time of personal tragedy, and that cultural wisdom was that you don't smother a guy with interest in the beginning, and he was genuinely baffled at why I would ever, ever feel like I was overstepping my bounds or ""bothering"" him by reaching out to him, and that ""2 really great dates"" was enough ""permission""...). Do you crazy fools really mean it when you say you want to hear ALL the positive affirmation and confirmation buzzing around in my spastic brain?  I mean...when I really like someone... it's a lot.   

3) I do still feel like he is holding back and testing the waters a little, though it seems like expressing feelings is - GASP - actually working.  Is that the case, if you've been hurt and feeling like you can't fully trust the other person to appreciate you/not walk all over you?  I mean, now that I understand why he was feeling that way, I totally get it, and I am happy to keep going with feels and affirmation and appreciativeness - hell, I have whole lists stored up from the first few weeks, and basically getting BEGGED to express them is kind of a dream - but with consistency in that as we move forward, the trust will come?  'Cause, you know, we ENFPs like reciprocation  Example: I had to be the one to reach out to verify plans or no plans for this week (we had been waiting for his schedule to be confirmed), which was frustrating because he had said he would let me know, but since he did respond and with a somewhat guarded expression of disappointment that he had an unescapable commitment (for his child) on the only night that would have worked, I expressed disappointment that our schedules weren't lining up to see each other before my vacation, and then he said something about me forgetting all about him since it would be so long, I said something reassuring and teasing, and he came back with ""can't wait to hear about the vacation"" - it was like he was waiting to see if I was REALLY going to follow through on my end before he started reciprocating interest again.  But it did make me feel like things were progressing in the right direction, after like a week of getting polite, pleasant, and positive - but limited - responses to my texts.

tl;dr - I think he is telling me that he means what he says and says what he means, and he likes hearing all my warm and fuzzy feelings about him.  All the time.  And if I'm confused, I can ask, and he will tell me what is going on.  He says he's simple, and that I am overcomplicating matters by worrying about how he will react to my natural instincts/expressions of feeling, and to STOP IT and just talk to him. THIS SOUNDS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE.  Is it really that simple?  Are you all un-smother-able if you really like someone??  (assuming I allow some alone/down time, which I absolutely have no issue with, as I need it, too - oh, and not making, like, crazy big jumps into future-talk because... no...)"
"If there was ever a perfect demonstration of Si, Fe and Ti working together in complete harmony.. this is it right here. Absolutely genius."
"I am an ISFJ-P 
I feel incredibly alone and vulnerable, but no one notices, no one reaches out to hold my heart, and I will likely always be this way, simply because I am not sure I will ever be able to trust anyone at that depth of my heart ever again, even though that's what I need at the core of who I am. God created me for others, but the one that I chose apparently got the memo and chose to betray me at the core of who I am and then poke fun and make light of how I felt, incredulous that anyone could feel like that.

I am just sick of false advertisement and I am not sure I will ever find someone outside of this relationship when or if it ever ends, because unlike others, I take vows seriously"
"Hello, I was wondering...

Does it ever happen to you to ""check"" others' opinions, conclusions just to confirm your own, feel more confident?
Do you ever have those ""wait...it doesn't make sense...is it really...shouldn't it...maybe this..."" and look at others' comments to be more confident? validate your thoughts?

A few days ago, I was watching an article comparing dogs to know which one is the strongest, I figured ""maybe it's their physique as well as the strength of their bites..."" but at the same time, I still checked the conclusion instead of just calling it a day after my ""theory"". And it can happen quite a lot to me... does that happen to you? frequently?

Thanks in advance!"
"Hello, male INTJ here asking about female ISFJ. We are both in early 30's.

Positives:

She is super nice to me in person.
She Is very conservative, but let me touch her while doesn't allow anyone else to do so.
She told me secretes about her childhood that even her family doesn't know.
She cried in front of me several times.
She tried to cook for me.
She invited me several times to meet.
She told me her phone code.
I told her once i liked her hair this way, so she started to do it like i told her.
She smiles with me like i am a comedian.

Negatives:

She is online almost all the time after her work, but replies to my texts usually after a day, with short answers, and doesn't ask questions to keep the conversation going.
In the middle of texting, she disappears for an hour, and comes back like nothing happened.
Lately, I sent her 4 questions, she replied to one, and told me she was busy. I told her ok, but I need answers for the rest, the next day, she told me again she was busy. The next day she apologized for not replying because she was busy, wished me a ""happy holiday"", I wished her the same, but she didn't even opened that message, nor replied to the rest of the questions. It's now two weeks.
5 days later from sending the questions, she sent a comic picture with a group that has only 4 participants, which me and her are from these participants, but still, didn't reply to me.

My questions:
1- is she interested or not?
2- is she a bad texter, or is this how ISFJ text, or she is simply not interested?
3- any advice on how to deal with this situation?"
ùóúùó¶ùóôùóù (ùóöùó®ùó•ùóóùóúùóîùó°ùó¶)
"There seemed to be some pushback when I posted a similar list by Susan Storm on the INFJ forum. No one should take this list verbatim.  If anything, there may be another list posted in another forum where you can compare and contrast the differences and similarities based on Ms. Storm's assessment:

#1 ‚Äì You Crave A Sense of Continuity
Knowing what to expect in life is crucial to you as an ISFJ. Having a plan, routine, and structure for your day gives you a sense of peace and frees up your mind to focus on more exciting things. You naturally create routines, pleasant rituals, and habits that make your life feel dependable and positive.

#2 ‚Äì You Have an Extraordinary Sense of Responsibility
It‚Äôs vital to you to follow through on what you‚Äôve said you will do. Your word isn‚Äôt given lightly, and when you make a commitment it‚Äôs held close to your heart. You believe in loyalty, reliability, and selflessness and try to emulate this in your life.

#3 ‚Äì You Experience the Present Through Filters of Your Past
Almost instantaneously, you make comparisons between what‚Äôs happening now and what happened in the past. You tend to see patterns because of this, and readily notice when an action doesn‚Äôt fit the pattern. You‚Äôll quickly notice when someone‚Äôs body language changes, when their tone of voice changes, or even when a room has been re-decorated in a minor way. This is because you are constantly making comparisons and noticing when there‚Äôs an aberration in the overall pattern.

#4 ‚Äì You Enjoy Creating Traditions and Pleasing Rituals
Whether you‚Äôre re-creating your grandmother‚Äôs best chocolate chip cookie recipe or celebrating the winter‚Äôs solstice by lighting a candle and listening to your favorite songs, traditions are close to your heart. You naturally create pleasant rituals and enjoy revisiting them year after year to commemorate special moments in your life.

#5 ‚Äì You Replay the Past in Vivid Detail
You have a vivid and rich internal memory and you enjoy recalling beautiful memories regularly. Re-experiencing your favorite memories can get you into a state of ‚Äúflow‚Äù and can remind you of the events that have made life worth living. At the same time, you can also replay negative past experiences in vivid detail. You might lie awake in bed at night replaying about something embarrassing you did in junior high or a relationship blunder you regret. It‚Äôs crucial for you to learn to forgive yourself for past mistakes so that you don‚Äôt get wrapped up in a cycle of punishing yourself for them.

#6 ‚Äì You Have Nuanced Inner-Body Sensations
You tend to notice inner-body signals very quickly. This can mean noticing symptoms of sickness earlier than other types or tasting nuances in flavors that others miss. Because you‚Äôre so sensitive to inner-body sensations, you prioritize getting enough sleep, eating at consistent times, and taking care of yourself physically.

#7 ‚Äì You Thrive When You Can Do Detail-Oriented Projects Alone
Whether you‚Äôre knitting a sweater, carving, cooking, or weeding your garden, you enjoy being alone to really immerse yourself in the details of something. When you can tune out all the noise of the outer world and really delve into a project in-depth you experience a calming sense of satisfaction.


#8 ‚Äì You Have Favorite TV Shows You‚Äôll Never Tire of Re-Watching
Maybe you have a Doctor Who marathon every summer or a Gilmore Girls party every fall. Whatever it is, there‚Äôs probably a book or television series that you watch annually because it puts you in a particular mood and helps you commemorate a tradition that brings you joy or makes you laugh.

#9 ‚Äì You Have a Strong Sense of What You ‚ÄúShould‚Äù or ‚ÄúShould Not‚Äù Do
You are guided by your values and regularly assess your actions to see if they‚Äôre lining up with what your conscience is telling you. A sense of ‚Äúshould‚Äù or ‚Äúshould not‚Äù guides you and influences the actions you take. You put a lot of thought into your decisions to see if the consequences will be things you can be proud of.

#10 ‚Äì You Love Good Vibes
Creating a relaxed, optimistic atmosphere is something that brings you a lot of joy. You enjoy swapping jokes and interesting stories with your friends, making your house smell nice with candles or baked goods, or playing low-key competitive games. Creating, or being in, an atmosphere that is laid-back, harmonious, and pleasant is food for your soul.

#11 ‚Äì You Innately Know What People Want
You quickly pick up on the non-verbalized needs and emotions of other people. If you have friends over, you immediately notice if someone seems cold and might need a blanket or someone is looking around and probably wants to know where the bathroom is. You also notice when one person seems to like another person or when somebody wants to give criticism but is trying to figure out the most tactful way to give it.

#12 ‚Äì It Can Be Difficult for You to Take Care of Yourself Because You‚Äôre So Focused On Others
This is especially true of ISFJ parents and spouses. Because ISFJs are so in tune with the emotional and physical needs of others they can feel compelled to ‚Äúfix‚Äù things for everyone else instead of meeting their own needs. They often feel guilty for taking time for themselves, especially if they know others are struggling or could use some help. Eventually, this tends to lead to burnout or co-dependency, so it‚Äôs crucial for ISFJs to learn to set healthy boundaries and practice saying ‚Äúno.‚Äù


#13 ‚Äì You Are Very Protective of Family
You‚Äôll go the extra mile to protect your loved ones from harm ‚Äì especially those in your family or inner circle of friends. You have a gift for creating stability, security, and dependability for the people you care about. It‚Äôs like you create a force field of protection and gentle care around the people you love.

#14 ‚Äì You Thrive When You Can Create Something High-Quality
You‚Äôd rather do something well than do it fast. While you are extremely conscious of deadlines, it‚Äôs more important for you to produce high-quality results than to get something done ahead of schedule. You get a sense of pleasure from perfecting every detail of a project or task and many people consider you to be meticulous.

#15 ‚Äì When You‚Äôre Stressed, You See Negative Possibilities Everywhere
During cases of extreme or chronic stress, you get lost in catastrophic thinking. You imagine dozens of worst-case scenarios and every negative possibility makes you think of another connected tragedy. Find out ways to manage stress here: How Each Myers-Briggs¬Æ Personality Type Reacts to Stress, and How to Help

#16 ‚Äì You Dislike Telling People What to Do
You‚Äôd rather give people information than be overly-directive with them. For example, instead of saying, ‚ÄúBob, would you set up a hotel reservation for August 13th?‚Äù You might say, ‚ÄúBob, do you know a good hotel for our trip on August 13th?‚Äù

#17 ‚Äì You Also Dislike Being Told What to Do
While you might seem quiet and agreeable on the outside, inside you‚Äôre a bit of a rebel. You can handle some structure and rules, but you don‚Äôt like dealing with authoritative, rank-pulling individuals. You appreciate people who give everyone a chance to have a voice in a decision. You believe that the best decision comes from collaboration.

#18 ‚Äì You Don‚Äôt Ask Things of Others You Wouldn‚Äôt Do Yourself
You hate intruding on others‚Äô time and space, so delegating can be hard for you. You‚Äôre unlikely to ask someone to do something you wouldn‚Äôt do, and many times you try to just do things yourself rather than asking for help.

#19 ‚Äì You Get Quiet When You Get Upset
You are famously patient and understanding, but there are limits. When you‚Äôve been angered by someone repeatedly, you‚Äôre likely to get quiet and retreat into mental analysis. This is when you delve into your Sensing and Thinking functions. You try to find the rational reasons for your anger and explore whether there are any logical inconsistencies you‚Äôre not seeing. You also try to look at the history of the situation to see if there are any negative patterns that are repeating themselves. Just be careful. If you keep stifling your anger it‚Äôs likely to come out in a surprisingly explosive way. While it may be difficult to verbalize your anger, it‚Äôs an important part of a healthy relationship.

#20 ‚Äì You Have a Good Sense of Humor
You enjoy lighthearted banter, friendly teasing, and situational humor. You also enjoy sharing memes or funny gifs online. You tend to find something offbeat and funny in nearly any situation, but you don‚Äôt always verbalize it. You might just get a sparkle in your eye and a half-smile on your face as a funny scenario or impression plays in your mind‚Äôs eye. You can even be gifted in turning a conflict situation into something funny and helping people to laugh about it.

#21 ‚Äì You Crave Tangible Sensory Experiences
You enjoy taking your favorite objects in your hands and touching them, noticing every detail on your fingertips. You savor the texture of warm, fuzzy socks and cherish the first sip of a hot cup of tea. When you feel something, you try to notice every detail about it and experience it in all its intensity.

#22 ‚Äì You‚Äôre Wary of Intrusive People
While you‚Äôre typically friendly, generous, and easy-going, people who seem especially needy or physically overbearing make you put your guard up. You like steady, loyal relationships where you have the freedom to disappear for a busy week or two (or month even) and re-connect as if no time has ever gone by. People who blow up your phone with texts or are always invading your personal space often make you feel uncomfortable and hesitant.

#23 ‚Äì You Take Great Joy in Simple Pleasures
You believe that life is made up of thousands of precious moments that other people fail to appreciate in their hurry. From the glisten of dewdrops on a blade of grass to the taste of an icy cold popsicle on a hot summer day, you try to savor all the little details and moments that make life worth living.

#24 ‚Äì You Struggle to See Your Own Potential
You tend to struggle when it comes to forecasting your abilities and potential. You live from moment to moment and try to enjoy all that life has to offer, but you don‚Äôt always know how to anticipate what‚Äôs coming down the road years from now. You may have incredible gifts and abilities that could be used in powerful ways, but it often takes a friend to help you realize the potential of your many strengths."
"Do you like watching movies, ISFJs?
Yesterday I watched Odd Thomas and I found it very interesting.
I think Thomas has some characters of INFJ like Batman in Batman series. The film is about the good and the bad with mixed events which could guide the audiences to follow the main actors misleading thoughts.
This film has a lot of emotional and thrilling materials that touch my senses. Overall, the movie has decent actors/actresses and astonishing end (except some violent and scary scenes which you might be afraid of and 1 predictable culprit). 
My judgment: 8/10"
"Congregate here isfj men. ü§§ 
Tell me about yourselves."
"I have some ISFJs in my life who I love - but some of the things they do and say drive me insane, often to the point where even though I love them I strongly dislike the way they behave.

For example, my mother is an ISFJ. I know she loves me, but she's suffocating me. She has me wrapped up in cotton wool, and whenever I try and tell her I'm capable of looking after myself, she gets very upset and tells me 'she's just showing that she cares'. I appreciate that she cares, and I tell her this, but I would like her to appreciate that I can't be happy without my independence. I may live at home, but I am a grown women (19). 

It gets worse when she's stressed. She'll suddenly take on a whole new personality - when I was a little girl (about seven) I used to describe her to my friends as 'good mom' and 'bad mom'. Good mom was loved to laugh, and kindly corrected me if I did something wrong - I was a very good girl, and anything I did wrong was completely unintentional. Bad mom was completely irrational - if I accidentally did something wrong, something Good mom would normally laugh about, Bad mom would scream at me or hit me.

Of course, she doesn't hit me anymore, but the screaming has gotten worse. Only recently have I been standing up for myself, telling her that there's no rational reason for her to be acting this way, that it's unfair for her to take her stress out on me when I've done nothing wrong. If I make a logical, valid argument, (and don't get me wrong, I'm always polite about it), she either slams the door in my face and walks out, or uses the 'I'm so tortured card' (""I'm so stressed, and you're not, but you ARE adding to my stress in some indirect way, therefore I have every right to scream at you"").

And the worst part? She goes on for hours, sometimes even days, and the entire 'argument' can usually be summed up into a single paragraph - she just rewords and repeats until she's left breathless. And when she's out of breath? She sulks, and snaps, and ignores me. I feel like it makes her feel a little bit better if she can make everyone feel as miserable as she feels.

It doesn't make any sense because I am very, very careful never to do anything wrong. I always try to be polite, honest, modest, gentle, helpful, kind - everything a daughter should be. Her argument for her actions are usually something along the lines of 'I'm stressed because you haven't cleaned the bathroom this week' - she has NEVER asked me to clean the bathroom in my life. How should I know?

So then I'll offer a compromise - ""Of course, I'll go and it now! How about I start doing it once a week from now on?"" But that's never what she wants to hear. She'll reply with something like 'It's too late now! I've already done it. I wanted it done yesterday.""

Then why didn't she tell me yesterday? Because I should have thought to be helpful on my own accord, of course!

And so the argument goes round in circles. 

Basically, how do I deal with the irrational, emotional side of this ISFJ without moving out? Because I know moving out right now would break her heart, but I have to do something. I do not get depressed or upset easily, but my mother leaves me awake crying at night - and that's something not many ENTPs can admit to. She is the only person to make me cry in the past 10 years (besides a breakup with a boyfriend 4 years ago), and somehow she constantly manages to depress me. I need to find a way to deal with her, or I'll have to leave.

Can anyone help?"

"List some of your favorite movies and explain why.


1.  Amelie - Cinematography.  I love the quirky yet simple plot, and the quick pace through the movie.  This movie is the epitome of eye sensory satisfaction.

2.  The Color Purple - Always one of my favorites, even as a young girl.  It's the heart wrenching tear-jerker that really shakes my emotions to the core.

3.  The Jerk - I tend to love simple, stupid humor (like Dumb and Dumber) because there is nothing to absorb at a sensory level."
"o.o I'm a 6 and test as INFP....but I see a ton of similarities between me and ISFJs. What would be the difference between an ISFJ and an INFP?

I am confident in my ability to ""just figure things out as I go along"", I'm messy and disorganized, but like to have a goal to concentrate efforts on. Don't really have detailed plans or to do lists and I don't make plans for the next day or anything. Rules bother me, being told what to do bothers me as well. I also don't like it if I have to take care of someone else...imo people should learn to handle themselves, but will help despite this. 

o.o details kinda bother me, I just want the big picture or the bottom line so I know what I'm dealing with before I address any details. Details kinda frustrate me...especially if there is no end to it..

Other then that pretty much ISFJ ."
"anybody ISFJ here that have relationship with ESTJ?
my boyfriend is an ISFJ and sometimes we have our problem that mostly about Fe or Extrovert Feeling, as an ESTJ i feel so hard to understand anyone's feeling and sometimes i'm not sensitive enough to use some (maybe) appropriate manner to other meanwhile especially for ISFJ it's very important. 
Also in relationship ISFJ likes to play victim card a lot and require me to understand what they feel and use 'feeling' too win the fight. and again for me it's like ""please don't force me to use 'feel'""
so, can i get some advice how to deal with ISFJ?"
"Hello ISFJs! In this interview, I talked to Claire and Lynda about their similarities and differences as ISFJs. The stereotype of ISFJs working in healthcare is definitely valid as both individuals work in that field. The big difference however is with Lynda being self above tribe being a jumper ISFJ (Si+Ti) while Claire is tribe above self-being the standard ISFJ (Si-Fe). During the interview, Claire talked about being uncomfortable being the centre of attention. Lynda, however, didn't seem to mind either way as long as she gets to do what she wants. We also talked about being an IxxJ control freak and Lynda talked about making a mess with Jello with her kids when they were younger to train herself not to freak out hard when it comes to chaos. Claire talked about perhaps being the bad cop with her kids because of her lead SF blast nagging them. However, both Claire and Lynda are double-deciders and they said ultimately, they want their kids to make their own life decision because they are their own person. We also talked about Fe shaming people and they said they don't really do it that much because their Ti acts as brakes from going overbearing with doing that. Claire shared how much she dislikes the idea of people thinking you would be a bad parent if your kid is a troublemaker because you're different individuals. We also discussed their ExxP swing and Lynda said she is doing it more now as an adult going on trips and cruises and just enjoying life. Claire said she did that more when she was in college and had a partying phase. Watch this interview here:"
"Hello! I am an enfp female, seeking advice on an isfj relationship. So recently I met an isfj who really liked me. He pursued me and after a while, I liked him back. We went out and he even forced a kiss on me. After that, he became kinda weird. He still texted me daily, but he is reluctant to hang out, citing that he didn't want anything to happen. He says we should just let nature takes its course when it comes to our relationship and he told me to reconsider it carefully because of the many obstacles we have (cultures, nationality, education, income). Even his way of texting has changed. Like he became more passive and less involved. He also seems reluctant to tell me personal information which he used to share. 
However, there was this incident that just happened where I was sick and he rushed down to take me home...so I reckon that he still likes me. I just dunno what to do from here on. Is there a way to change the whole relationship dynamics again? Or what should I do?"
"First I must warn this is a 25min long read! If you got through it all, I deeply appreciate it!

This is the ISFJ part of a self-reflection project which I write how ISFJs have influenced and helped me grow as a better person. I hope for this blog to be a positive contribution to the MBTI community.

Thanks in the advance for the read and feel free to comment!"
Hi how would a ISFJ 6w5 look like?
"I think I know the reason why I'm so damn lazy. 

Yes, being an INFP 9 makes it so I'm already predisposed to being lazy, but I believe having an ISFJ mother only exacerbates the problem. Why? Because she does everything for me. She will tell me to do stuff and then being typical me I'll procrastinate until I finally work up the will to do it. Only, when I'm about to go do it I discover that it's already been done. I suppose that's nice thing to discover that something I don't really want to do has been done, but it also makes me feel even more useless. What's worse is that because I know she will eventually do it I will not try as hard to work up the will power to do it myself. When I try to talk about it with her she gets offended that what she does actually hurts me in a way. So, she throws up her hands and says ""Fine do it all yourself!"" She'll stop for a while but then it goes back to the way it was before. This creates a vicious circle of sloth for me.

I know she does it because 1) She cares about me and likes doing things for me. and 2) She gets impatient and would rather just do it herself than wait for me to do it.

Could I get your perspective on this ISFJs?"
"Are ISFJ less sexually permissive?

Are ISFJ very monogamous? 

What are ISFJ 's views on one night stands?

What do ISFJs look for in a relationship? 

Can ISFJ seperate sex from love? 

Is it very hard for ISFJs to get emotionally close to a partner?"
"You all deserve better descriptions

It‚Äôs bad enough that sensors get shitty descriptions, but I think Si users get hit it worse than an Se user. They see someone who is judgmental, rude, homophobic, etc. And they immediately think, ‚ÄúOh that‚Äôs my mom/dad!‚Äù But like, not all ISFJs are like that. And I‚Äôm saying this as someone who is questioning right now if they are one. To be honest, I‚Äôm a teen, and I only got into MBTI to figure out what was wrong with me; I honestly wish I could quit, but now I‚Äôm just stuck in this series of over analyzing myself and wondering if this is who I am. I know I‚Äôm a sensor and I feel extroverted, because I feel like I need to be around people, or I‚Äôll get lonely and start having dark thoughts. It‚Äôs weird because I‚Äôm usually between ESFP or ISFJ, which are shadow functions of each other. Because I feel like I‚Äôm both. Like I act confident and I‚Äôll say and do stuff without thinking and I‚Äôm impulsive. And I care about being true to myself and I can also relate to Ni grip and a Te loop. But I can also relate to the Ti loop as well, when it comes to focusing on past mistakes, and trying to figure out what the connection is to who I am, and if it means anything. Like Si for example, comes when I organize, like i organized my binder yesterday and that made me feel really good as well as cleaning my room and getting my room done, and I got up early to make my lunch and get ready in time, which made me feel good knowing I had everything done. Or like Se when it comes to improvising, it can depend, but like for assignments or school or something, I‚Äôm good at it. Like I‚Äôll do assignments or essays at the last minute and get a 100; it happened with an assignment I did yesterday. When it comes to Fe, it‚Äôs a weird thing. Because when someone starts crying, I don‚Äôt really cry. I‚Äôll feel sad and want to help them though, in any way possible. And I‚Äôll check up on them. I also frequently vent to my friends or I would vent online, which is something I need to work on, because I barely know how to deal with my feelings. I also feel like I can be a burden and annoy people. When it comes to Ti, it usually comes as wanting to do the quickest thing possible or finding easy solutions to things or constantly re editing my thoughts and why I say and type, like what I am doing now , but I would also say that is Te. For Ne, I usually use it to say weird what if scenarios, like what if I just drank that weird shit or something idk, but I also use it to think of negative what if‚Äôs and think that everything is going to go wrong and it‚Äôll be like that always. But idk maybe it‚Äôs also Ni. But this turned into me rambling: Basically, I think you all deserved more credit. I barely see any good descriptions, only a few. You guys have such terrible stereotypes, which could make a lot of people not get their actual type, especially when it‚Äôs Si. So yeah."
"Hello ISFJs! In this interview, I got a chance to talk to every single IxxJ type (both standard and jumper variations) talk about their fears, similarities, and differences. Lindsay (INTJ) asked her fellow IxxJs how their fears physically manifest in their body. Lynda (ISFJ jumper) asked how being tribe above self affects the IxxJs first function. Avis (INTJ jumper) asked how to prevent other people's chaos from affecting themselves. Rose (ISFJ) asked how their sexual modalities change the experience of their first function. Kevin (INFJ) asked fellow IxxJs how they experience relationships. Joyce (INFJ jumper) asked which part of their OPS code they related to the most. Jamie (ISTJ) asked what was the most useful thing they learned when they got their type back. Cherie (ISTJ jumper) didn't have any questions. Some of the big moments in the interview is when Rose discovered the pattern that those that have feminine as their first function tend to be more paranoid or neurotic than those that have a masculine first function. I also learned that containers holding liquids with faulty lids are the bane of an IxxJs existence because they end up spilling the liquid everywhere. And interestingly, many IxxJs plan their ExxP moment by going on vacation and acting like an ExxP when they are not home. Watch this interview here:"
"Hey there,
I would like to know your INFJs take on this. You may judge me for the infidelity part ...

I don't get this ISFJ (29m).
He's been with his first girlfriend (long-distance) for over 10 years. We started having casual sex about 9 monthes ago. He made the first step. We started texting a lot, were seeing each other once or twice a week. Cuddling and talking afterwards. We starting meeting for a walk or lunch just as often.

Well. I fell in love. And to me it feels like he is, too.

He is very private about his relationship. And  reluctant to talk about it. No matter to whom. Only when I repeatedly asked weither he was happy with his girlfriend he said: yes. Another time when I tried to talk openly he told me straight away: ‚ÄûI don't want to start a relationship with you. I am already in a relationship.‚Äú

As far as I know he has been cheating on his girlfriend quiet a few times. It started when he fell in love with another girl who was making an effort to seduce him a couple of years ago. That girl told me he wanted to leave his girlfriend. But when she came round, he had fallen out of love.

He confessed that he did not have sex with his girlfriend since we started having sex. It seems that she is never been much interested in sex... which is a pitty, because he is a very gifted lover who enjoys sex and intimacy beyond measure.

He is just as unwilling to talk about how we feel for each other. He shows me in many ways that he cares. He avoided phrasing it as ‚Äûbeeing in love with me‚Äú but, actually, that is what I'm guessing. (Or hoping?) He did mention casualy, however, how he told a friend he was besotted with me. He is very appreciative and caring. He said he enjoys working with me. He compliments me a lot. On my body just as much as my personality. (He says stuff like: ‚ÄûHow can one person be this wonderfull?‚Äú) When we can't see each other, he texts me that he misses me. Before we meet (even for work) he will text that he is locking forward to it. We are secretly holding hands under the table (e.g. in a bar with freinds). Well, and we just can't take our hand of each other. When I told him I would like to see him more often, he said I was pushing an open door.
But when I said I wanted more, he backed off. He tries to make it sound like we have a great friendship. Every time I told him that I don't want to be just friends he told me with tears in his eyes that he didn't want me to leave.

The grown up in me knows that this guy is not willing to leave his girlfriend, that I should not try to interfere any more ‚Ä¶ and that this is a stupid place to start a realitionship anyway.
But being realistic is not my strength. And the dreamy romantic part of me just wants to be with him. Because this feels amazing. Because I know how relunctant he is about big changes.
I feel stupid and naive. But then again. I felt like that every single time I fell in love.

I appreaciate any reply. Thank you so much for your time!
(I feel better just be writing this down.)"
"Hello ISFJs! In this interview, I got a chance to talk to Mingdi about what it's like to be an ISFJ Si-Ti SC/P(B) FF. ISFJs are rare in the personality community so it's nice to hear from Mingdi on how he experiences life as one. We first talked about how obvious he was lead ST and how robotic he comes across. He then talked about his NT consume and how he gathers a lot of information to figure out a solution for his problems. Mingdi also talked about journaling to make his feminine Si solid; otherwise, it makes it difficult for his Ti to make a concrete conclusion or decision. We also talked about his NF play and how Mingdi is interested to see what people are up to and why they made those decisions. He also talked about his double feminine SF blast and how he rarely uses it and getting started is extremely difficult for him. We also talked about him having tester sexual modalities and he always wants to try different food and restaurants. Watch this interview here:"
ISFJ who were your favorite superheros growing up? Mine were Batman and Spawn.
