I thought it might be cool to see how many people of different enneatypes we have here... so I'll start, and then the next person to post, copy-and-paste the list from the person above you and add yourself. Hopefully at the end we'll have a super long list!

"I’m reading a neuroscience book about the power of meditation and/or prayer and what it can do for your brain even when you aren’t religious.  Some of the take-home tips about meditation suggested are that focusing the mind on your spiritual goals each day can have the effects of: increased memory, less anxiety, slower to anger or irritate, better social awareness, noticeably quicker ability to solve tasks, to name a few.

They tossed the idea of “spiritual goals” out there without describing what spiritual goals are.

I have been very religious most of my life and used to have quite transformative experiences with prayer, so this morning I wanted to pray like I used to.  No, I haven’t been praying, a few years ago I decided it was useless as I no longer am a believer and have not been able to get my belief back, despite prayer.  I figure the things I mentioned in my prayer this morning might be considered spiritual goals—here is my prayer from this morning:

“Help me to feel healthy enough to help my patients today. Help my secretary and I to get along (she’s been mad that I’ve been off sick— of course it makes a lot of extra stress and work for her). Help me to figure out how to make my kids feel loved this Christmas and figure out what to do for them (presents, Christmas atmosphere, etc.)

I guess those are spiritual goals?  For me my connections with others/what I give out to others?  I can’t imagine what else would be…

But just like this book says every single person has a very unique take on God (it doesn’t matter if they are in the same religion— one will focus on him as an vengeful cosmic force, the next like a loving human parent, another a spirit from within) use very different language to describe spiritual experiences— and how incredibly surprising this was to the researchers— I bet each person would have a very unique take on their spiritual goals.

Would you be willing to share yours with me/us? I would love to get an idea of what this means for others.  Thank you and well wishes!"

"Today I had a rude awakening, the kind that you only invite when you try to explain to someone who unintentionally hurt you what you learned from them hurting you. 

It made me understand that my world view and optimism are based on the idea that there is meaning in learning. Ibelieved that the purpose of life is to learn and to become a better person, but what if further perspective means that the lessons I learned so strongly were wrong when given  more time and perspective.  Even if they were true for me at the moment, what if they never apply to anything current or future?  Will I be able to even help others?  I always want to write a book to make people feel and learn, and maybe by reading what I went through and learned then they can feel less alone and understand the lesson I learned— but hopefully without the heartache of years.

I was raised with stories that happened to people during World War 2 and I thought my whole generation learned racism was wrong, that oppressed people have voices to be heard. I’ve been thinking lately that we forgot these lessons and that now people are focused on what they are learning And the problems alive today. I had an optimism that by the time I was older there would be equality. It seemed it was going that way.

Then I think that my generation hasn’t done enough for climate change, yet we might be the last generation who really remember playing outside before the Internet. Who remember how loud the bees were in every bush and tree, who know how few birds and frogs there are now compared to how it was when I was a kid. And I don’t think there is really anything truly wild anymore, maybe only up in Northern regions, but there was when I was a kid. So this lesson… will it mean the same to any future group?

I was realizing all at once that my optimism is based on the importance of learning and that simultaneously I was learning that my learning wasn’t so important and then, to save me, a wave of humor comes into my heart making me laugh at myself, love myself and know that this moment in time is as important as any future understanding and still serves that same purpose of letting me know I’m not alone and others will not be alone.

Other things explored today was the cult out there of Twinflames.  A friend who asked me yesterday “Can I ask you, are you living the life that you want to?”  And thoughts about unresolved trauma and how I deal with it. This might be my new diary."
"Okay, this is actually a scientific-like question!   I might need to change the title. 
I was listening to INxJs talk about how they experience sex and attraction and it was completely foreign.  Once again, something I thought was universal is not.   It sounds like Se experiences both attraction and sex completely differently than us.    I hope to also ask high Se-users.     
Also for some of this you might want to think back to when you were experiencing attraction for the first few times.

Here's what I want to know:

1.  What clues are there for you that you are attracted to someone?  What happens in your mind and in your body to let you know?

2.  To what degree does sensory input (someone's smell, feel, physical attributes) tell you that you are attracted?

3.  To what degree does someone's mind and heart attract you?

4.  Is attraction completely separate from feelings for a person?  Or are they pretty much one and the same?



I am not quite sure that I'm getting to the heart of what I want to know.   It was hard for me to pin-point what was so different about the way that inferior Se experiences attraction and I'll be super curious to see what you guys say and also to see what higher Se users say... but first lets go with this for us so that I can fine-tune my questions.."
Can an ENFP be always needy in interactions? This is just a thought and not an absolute truth about all ENFPs. But I wanted to know from your experiences. And break this thought by sharing your perspectives.

"ENFPs are supposed to get annoyed, at best, when people start being clingy with them and become detached and give a total ""cold shoulder"" if things get really bad. The books I've read say this is because our emotional circuits are overwhelmed with our own lives, but while I can agree with this on the rare occasion I also get annoyed with clingy people when I know I'm in a very emotionally stable place.

I've been trying to think why this is for me. I think one of the core reasons is I'm on a search for self and authenticity. This search doesn't involve me obsessively tying myself to anyone, so when people do it to me I find it a bit pathetic to be harsh. I know this feeling goes into OVERDRIVE when that person asks me to 'help' them with an emotional issue, not being able to get over a failed relationship or dating pursuit is a big one, and when I offer what I know is a solution and people don't take that advice, repeat the same mistakes, or simply don't want to do what it takes to get out of their place then I have no time for that.

It's gotten to the point where I've ended friendships and, more commonly, told people if they want to talk with me or hang out with me that subject never comes up again: ever.

Any similar experiences? Or maybe you guys totally disagree with me on how I hand these situations."

"Okay, guys… this is one the other types won’t get, except for the ENTPs and here we are not wanting to look this one in the face.

Okay… today two fellow Ne doms were in my office (at different times) and both at some point went on a deep dive for their phone. Either they or I said the following: “Is it in that pocket?” “it might be in this coat pocket?” “What about this pant pocket?” “Did it get left in the car?” “Do you want me to call you?”

One of them noticed that I was scrutinizing her while she was searching.  I was seriously wondering if she was going to find it quicker than I do in the morning.  It felt like a drum roll…. She looked up at me and said “I’m sure it’s here… somewhere.”

I used to not have a purse… I guess I was even worse back then? Kind of. Maybe? My purse holds a lot of stuff to look through…

About a year ago the guy who was at the door making sure everyone hand-sanitized for Covid… he knows I’m not stupid…at least not in the typical way. He watched me rummaging through my purse every stupid morning before clocking in. He said one day when I laughed at his expression: “Why do you always have to search through your purse?”

I knew the answer because I had realized a few years ago (because my infant Si had grown a baby tooth or said a first word or had some kind of leap in development, because I’m middle aged now). What learned that I had to pay attention when I was putting something AWAY. You see putting the badge in my purse every time was a new win— I usually was searching not just my purse but everything else too… my car… my bookshelves … my bathroom… but at age 45 my Si grew up enough to realize that I knew that if I pay attention when I take the thing off and put it in the same place then it later saves me time.

So I said “I forget to put it into the same place in my purse each time.”

He said “Well, why?” with so much genuine confusion. Because he knows I’m “smart”. We used to work together before he retired and started to do volunteer work. It would be incomprehensible to understand that I’m actually really proud of myself just for getting the thing into my purse consistently.

“Because my brain doesn’t work like most people’s. I forget to place it carefully in the same place when I take it off. I’m glad to get it just into my purse.”

“Well, WHY?”

“I don’t know… I’ve been working on it for my whole life.”

Okay, so when I got it into my purse consistently it was because all of a sudden EUREKA I suddenly understood I needed to pay attention when I took it off (novel concept), right?  Can I do it again to put it not just into my purse but into a certain part of my purse?

After watching the 2 Ne doms with their purses today… I realized how crazy this is that I don’t pay attention at that moment but can I do it?  After all— my brain is obviously nowhere near my purse at the moment I’m putting that thing away.  I will try.  We look ridiculous! But it’s endearing to me, of course. 

Because you know I’m talking about phones and badges here, but every Ne dom here knows I’m not just talking about phones and badges… I’m talking about keys and glasses and cards and flipping everything else. How many years of my life are spend searching for that THING I put down a minute ago?

Alright…’fess up ya’all. And give yourself a hug while you’re at it and our partners a hug too because… of course one of these ENFPs has a husband whose job is like my husband’s… to constantly observe me looking frantically for that THING and get concerned about it with me for the many hours of our life together…let’s all scream and hug! The one thing I’m sure of: We Ne doms HAVE to have self-compassion and humor for ourselves with the “thingies” or nobody else will, that’s for sure.

Fess up!  Please do!"
Hi all! I work from home in a smaller town during the week and I find I am always looking forward to the weekend when bae and I can go to town for chores and fun.

"Thanks to @witty on the tip on this one.

I love the set up.
Can you guess what kind of MBTI personality wrote this? (I felt like it was easy to guess… I guess I will say more on that later. I felt like they mixed up the definitions of some of their top functions a bit and didn’t understand the functions they don’t have very well, but, again, I love the set up! This is a test that I think could be quite successful if fine-tuned.

"I was wondering about our personality type and how many of us have ADHD?

Personally have reached a point where I'm questioning self worth and where it's tied as a person, with our experiences, upbringing and where ADHD plays a role with how to handle situations.

Also, how much does the respect you receive from your parents effect how your partner respects you?

I want to get the ENFP perspective of self worth, those with or without ADHD for the comparison and also views about how family dynamics influence relationships. (Great to include family dynamic MBTI types if they are known)"

"I wanna say I think Naruto is ENFP instead of ESFP which means Ne dom instead of Se dom.

I can understand people are confusing Ne and Se because they are looking at online random descriptions of Ne and Se. However there are a lot of misconceptions online... On the original book Psychological Types created by Carl Jung we can see the clear difference between Ne and Se and I will make my argument based on the original text.

Ne and Se can look alike one another, because both of them are extraverted perception functions, so they love to interact with the external world, the world around them. Characteristics like impulsivity or reckless can be applied to both Ne and Se, both of them are avid explorers, be either of sensations (Se) or possibilities (Ne). That's why a lot of Ne doms usually are eneagrams 7, which constantly seek new experiences, challenges and can have problems with impatience and impulsiveness.

The main difference between Ne and Se is that:
1) Se looks at the external objects as what it is, concretely, realistically.
2) Ne looks at the external object as what it could be, as what it could become, expectancy, potentials, possibilities.

That main difference between Se and Ne makes Ne more Idealistic and Se more Realistic by consequence.
And before people start to say that “it is just a stereotype”, let’s take a look at what Carl Jung says in his original book: Psychological Types.

Extraverted Sensation) “No other human type can equal the extraverted sensation type in realism.”
~ Carl Jung

Extraverted Intuition) “He actually has sensations, but he is not guided by them per se, merely using them as directing-points for his distant vision.”
~ Carl Jung

ℹ The question is pretty simple: Is Naruto a Realist or he is a person that uses the world around him as directing-points for his distant vision?

The answer is pretty obvious if we look at this main difference between Se and Ne.

Naruto is not a Realist at all.
Naruto is all about believing in possibilities.

Why?

Because
1️⃣ Naruto believes the world will become better even with all of the quintessential war of nations that constantly happen.
2️⃣ Naruto believes potential cold-blooded murderers like Gaara, Pain, Obito, etc will change their behavior and stop to act so badly.
3️⃣ Naruto believes the war will stop to happen.
4️⃣ Naruto believes Sasuke will stop to be so cold and revengeful.
5️⃣ Naruto believes he will take out all the hate inside Kurama as well: “Some day I'll come after all the hate inside you as well ❤“
6️⃣ Naruto believes Sasuke will come back to Konoha
7️⃣ Naruto even believes he will change the Hyuuga clan to a better version.
8️⃣ And finally, Naruto believes he will become a Hokage

Like, come on, to name another example... When Naruto was questioned by Pain about how he would end the cycle of hatred, Naruto's answer was to simply ask him to believe in the fact that he'll find a way to bring true peace to the world. The history of shinobi shows that the peace they built rested on sacrifices, yet Naruto believed he would achieve peace with nothing more than words. Naruto is overly idealistic instead of being a realist and focusing on the tangible reality where we live by the 5 senses.

That’s why we love Naruto, right? He does not accept the world as it is by being a Realist. Naruto is the opposite, he believes in a world with better possibilities.

Naruto absolutely is not a realist (Se), he is a possibility-minded person (Ne) which turns him into that idealistic dreamer personality full of hope of a world better than it is now. What could be > What it is. This is the core of Naruto’s personality and can be shown from Classic to Shippuden!

Also, Carl Jung already explictly wrote what Se thinks about ideals related to ideas.

Extraverted Sensation) ""His ideal is the actual¹; in this respect he is considerate. He has no ideals related to ideas""
~ Carl Jung, Psychological Types

actual¹: ""existing in fact; typically as contrasted with what was intended, expected, or believed.""
~ Oxford Languages

It speaks for itself...

How could we believe this is the dominating function for Uzumaki Naruto?
No ideals related to ideas?!

Also, some people can argue all of this strong idealistic nature of Naruto comes from his Fi aux... Well, the auxiliar function does not change the cognition of the dominant function. It is actually the opposite, the auxiliar function serves the dominant function without making any claim to the autonomy of its own principle.

Auxiliar Function) ""Hence the auxiliary function is possible and useful only in so far as it serves the leading function, without making any claim to the autonomy of its own principle.""
~ Carl Jung, Psychological Types

So the auxiliar Fi should not bring the unrealistic behavior to the Se dominant function, which is the most realist of all types according yo Carl Jung.

So, the auxiliar Fi is not the one that makes Naruto idealistic in a way that make him believe in better possibilities. Yes, Fi has strong authentic opinions and believes in unconscious images, but they keep it for themselves in a silent and cold attitude and has no interest in influencing others regarding his beliefs, like Jung said 👇

Introverted Feeling) ""They reveal a delightful repose, a sympathetic parallelism, which has no desire to affect others, either to impress, influence, or change them in any way."", ""They neither shine nor reveal themselves. Since they submit the control of their lives to their subjectively orientated feeling"", ""They are mostly silent, inaccessible, and hard to understand""
~ Carl Jung, Psychological Types

On the other hand, it is the dominating Ne that makes the person keeps talking about his ideals, talking about better possibilities and inspiring others in believing in a world with better possibilities. It is the dominating Ne that irradiates the enthusiasm around better possibilities and influence others by the enthusiasm as a consequence. And this is not stereotype. It actually is totally aligned with Carl Jung’s description of Extraverted Intuition👇

Extraverted Intuition) “His capacity to inspire his fellow-men with courage, or to kindle enthusiasm for something new, is unrivalled, although he may have forsworn it by the morrow. The more powerful and vivid his intuition, the more is his subject fused and blended with the divined possibility. He animates it; he presents it in plastic shape and with convincing fire; he almost embodies it. It is not a mere histrionic display, but a fate.”
~ Carl Jung, Psychological Types

👆🏻This is totally Naruto when he starts to think in better possibilities like the 8 examples I showed above...
Naruto’s personality is grounded on this characteristic of Ne...

There are a lot of misconceptions online regarding ENFP x ESFP and regarding Ne x Se and I want to point what Carl Jung himself has to say about Ne and Se.

What do you guys think?

Cheers!"
"Personally or not if you havent met one, how you would you describe an enfp 2w1 ? Strengths, faults, fun aspects ect."
"I've read that the ENFPs have more and better coping mechanisms than most.

I'd tend to agree with that assessment. I have several, some of which I shall list here.

What are your coping mechanisms when life gets tough? What gets you stressed in the first place?

My survival skills, a typical ENFP:
1. Generally be optimistic against all evidence. Believe that things will improve
2. See even the smallest positive ray and cling to that for dear life and as the reason to believe that there's a positive spin to the whole thing
3. Keep doing things I believe in and are important to my value system. Surround myself with like-minded people. Also have a few people who think otherwise to keep perspective
4. Have deep friends who are honest to me about what I am and am not doing right, and who cheer me even when I am slipping. Friends who never abandon, no matter what. I count INTJs, ENFJs, INFJs and gasp! ENTPs in this. And yes, also INTPs in their oddly decoupled yet accepting way
5. Take on projects - like crazy. Even when I can hardly handle what's already there.
6. Help people who have real problems in life, like a child with terminal illness. It gives an important perspective of how much harder life could be and instantly makes me feel grateful for what I already have. I feel privileged and thankful for the comforts and normality I have in my life
7. Sing, dance, or go for long walks
8. Learn something new in science. It always picks me up
9. Call a friend I've not called in some time and talk
10. Call my parents
11. Help my children out with something they need, or plan ahead for something I anticipate that they will soon need
12. Play badminton
13. Write a poem or some fiction
14. Learn something hard like a new programming language or a hard Mathematics concept
15. Tidy all clothes wardrobes or do grocery shopping
16. Engage in MBTI or science or music or English grammar discussions online"
"Think about what he's done.

He was good at organizing.

He was a charmeur, in fact he was a womanizer. (now, I was not expecting this)
He was not good in math, in fact he SUCKED at math, but he was good at poetry or literature.
He was almost more a politican than a phisicyst.
He made something believable what everyone thought was not possible.
Now what is Ne if not that?

Overall I think Oppenheimer was an ENFP.
His enthusiasm won him over when he realized he could create something what others couldn't, but ultimately he realized what he's done and he called for supervision.
I think it fits the ENFP profile more than anything.

"Paradox of Me

I believe in,
Dignity, 
Character,
Virtue,
And Conviction.

I believe that,
Kindness can be your strenght,
Creativity can be made real,
Making values into rules of laws.

Justice is my core,
Tight rein on my intuition,
Running inside me,
As my very source of essence.

When the times comes,
I will do whatever it takes,
I will set the wrong right,
Leading a rebellion.

Violence hurts me,
Evil offends me,

I can either choose, 
Not to see it,
Or
Feel the weight of it.

I am soft marshmallow,
Clad in the strongest armour,
Filled with verocity and conviction.

I am kind but dangerous,
I am affectionate but hard core,
Free, yet self discipline.

When I am angry,
Get out of my way,
I will be your deadly natural disaster.

If you are lucky,
I will find reason to forgive you,
That's the paradox of me...

"Okay, so I just broke up with my boyfriend (it was ""mutual"" aka we were having issues and he talked me into breaking up) and right now I just have this hollow feeling in the pit of my stomach but I haven't actually reacted to it yet, how do you (as ENFPs) react to breakups?"

"Over the years, my closest friends have tended to be ENFPs, they are a type (I feel) I connect best with. But I've realised a recurring trend which causes me angst!! Thoughts please! 


It seems to me that my ENFPs (and ENFJs) prefer to fill their lives with people in their immediate vicinity. Once they or I are living in a different city or country, it's like I'm off their radar, and they don't tend to make any effort to maintain the friendship. I come off feeling needy by trying to keep in touch. I eventually get to the point where I feel that they mean more to me than I do to them, and I so stop trying. 


But for me (INFJ), when I invest in a friendship, it's a long term investment. I find it taxing making close friendships, but they are important to me, whether near or far.


Any tips for maintaining long distance friendships with ENFs? Am I fighting a losing battle, or am I misinterpreting this?"

"I wonder if I will just keep this thread up and fish for it every time I meet a new ENFP— feel free to add your own description when you guys meet one too.

I see from 5-8 patients a day now (used to be more— but the appointments are now longer.  I’m not a doctor.  I’m a diabetes educator/dietitian, btw.)

Anyway, I just met another ENFP and I think I will keep writing and describing us.

This particular gal was so quick— so quick that the actual things I needed to teach her (which are complex concepts) took about 1/8th of the time. I went to re-hash everything like I usually do, because usually it takes a few repetitions and I could tell she had it.

BUT the conversation— all the things she was talking about—took LOADS of time. This particular girl’s Ne combined with what I think would often be called ADHD. She cannot get enough info. She is constantly learning new things, doing art, cooking and taking care of her family. It seems like she could have even handled a great deal more— if anyone was able to give that many concepts that fast, then I think she would be the quickest person to get a Ph.D.. IF anyone taught that way and tried to put something they have ever learned in fast-track. I gotta say nobody has ever come close to learning as fast in my office but at the same time talked so much. But it’s not like it wasn’t relevant. I think it’s just more than what most people usually do in a given space of time.

She said she’s just barely gotten onto an ADHD drug (she was never really diagnosed ) and says instead of looking for her keys three times in an hour each morning it’s now down to once. Progress. She knows nothing about MBTI, but it was really fun to see.

  She was very sweet and also has been through the wringer with her health— she has a rare diseases and has had a major organ transplant, so there was a lot to do, but the education, like I said, was a breeze…. The amount of into she brought to tie into what we were discussing was impressive.  It made the conversation different to manage than the average human being or even than the average ENFP — it was fun!   And I’m cheering for her!   She does SO much!  Much more than the average person in a day.

One other thing… she was able to ask questions that were conceptual based on the ones that I explained.  I’m glad when people can just put it to use.  Well done, ENFP.

Oh and I forgot…
Also, in a class I was teaching today (a new group each time), there was an ENFP man and he knew how to ask such good conceptual questions that I couldn’t help it, I basically told the core and over-view of what was happening in the body right upfront when he asked, and it’s more complex than I usually go for this class, but to my mind—- even though everybody else had gone silent— it helped explain everything that we were then going to talk about and a lot of people enjoyed that class today— so I think after I repeated a few of those concepts with examples later, it made a big impact.  After the class, he actually gave me info on something I’ve been looking for in the community for years… so… he got to the heart of everything fast.  Loved it!  He got excited to hear it all and so I did too."

As ENFPs, how does this come off to you, specifically in the context of people you don't know giving you a death stare or seeing someone with one that isn't necessarily paying attention to or focusing on you? Obviously, if you know an INTJ that has one and you're friends or in a relationship with them, things are going to be different, but from the perspective of a total stranger, I'd like to know how it registers with your type."
"Saw Oppenheimer last night.  I think it is Nolan’s masterpiece.  It was so well told! Brilliant in telling, in acting, visualization, the works.  What a great way to tell this story!  That he was already getting judged by others made it so that I didn’t have to worry about judging him myself, but could see why the decisions made were made and that the consequences were felt by most of those involved.

I wanted to see the Barbie movie this morning, but my girlfriends and I are gonna try for next week.  Greta Gerwig hopefully won’t disappoint a fellow ENFP.  I never touched Barbie’s growing up—I hate the smell of plastic.   I don’t think nostalgia is a requirement."

"I’m reading a neuroscience book about the power of meditation and/or prayer and what it can do for your brain even when you aren’t religious.  Some of the take-home tips about meditation suggested are that focusing the mind on your spiritual goals each day can have the effects of: increased memory, less anxiety, slower to anger or irritate, better social awareness, noticeably quicker ability to solve tasks, to name a few.

They tossed the idea of “spiritual goals” out there without describing what spiritual goals are.

I have been very religious most of my life and used to have quite transformative experiences with prayer, so this morning I wanted to pray like I used to.  No, I haven’t been praying, a few years ago I decided it was useless as I no longer am a believer and have not been able to get my belief back, despite prayer.  I figure the things I mentioned in my prayer this morning might be considered spiritual goals—here is my prayer from this morning:

“Help me to feel healthy enough to help my patients today. Help my secretary and I to get along (she’s been mad that I’ve been off sick— of course it makes a lot of extra stress and work for her). Help me to figure out how to make my kids feel loved this Christmas and figure out what to do for them (presents, Christmas atmosphere, etc.)

I guess those are spiritual goals?  For me my connections with others/what I give out to others?  I can’t imagine what else would be…

But just like this book says every single person has a very unique take on God (it doesn’t matter if they are in the same religion— one will focus on him as an vengeful cosmic force, the next like a loving human parent, another a spirit from within) use very different language to describe spiritual experiences— and how incredibly surprising this was to the researchers— I bet each person would have a very unique take on their spiritual goals.

Would you be willing to share yours with me/us? I would love to get an idea of what this means for others.  Thank you and well wishes!"

"Today I had a rude awakening, the kind that you only invite when you try to explain to someone who unintentionally hurt you what you learned from them hurting you. 

It made me understand that my world view and optimism are based on the idea that there is meaning in learning. Ibelieved that the purpose of life is to learn and to become a better person, but what if further perspective means that the lessons I learned so strongly were wrong when given  more time and perspective.  Even if they were true for me at the moment, what if they never apply to anything current or future?  Will I be able to even help others?  I always want to write a book to make people feel and learn, and maybe by reading what I went through and learned then they can feel less alone and understand the lesson I learned— but hopefully without the heartache of years.

I was raised with stories that happened to people during World War 2 and I thought my whole generation learned racism was wrong, that oppressed people have voices to be heard. I’ve been thinking lately that we forgot these lessons and that now people are focused on what they are learning And the problems alive today. I had an optimism that by the time I was older there would be equality. It seemed it was going that way.

Then I think that my generation hasn’t done enough for climate change, yet we might be the last generation who really remember playing outside before the Internet. Who remember how loud the bees were in every bush and tree, who know how few birds and frogs there are now compared to how it was when I was a kid. And I don’t think there is really anything truly wild anymore, maybe only up in Northern regions, but there was when I was a kid. So this lesson… will it mean the same to any future group?

I was realizing all at once that my optimism is based on the importance of learning and that simultaneously I was learning that my learning wasn’t so important and then, to save me, a wave of humor comes into my heart making me laugh at myself, love myself and know that this moment in time is as important as any future understanding and still serves that same purpose of letting me know I’m not alone and others will not be alone.

"Okay, this is actually a scientific-like question!   I might need to change the title. 
I was listening to INxJs talk about how they experience sex and attraction and it was completely foreign.  Once again, something I thought was universal is not.   It sounds like Se experiences both attraction and sex completely differently than us.    I hope to also ask high Se-users.     
Also for some of this you might want to think back to when you were experiencing attraction for the first few times.

Here's what I want to know:

1.  What clues are there for you that you are attracted to someone?  What happens in your mind and in your body to let you know?

2.  To what degree does sensory input (someone's smell, feel, physical attributes) tell you that you are attracted?

3.  To what degree does someone's mind and heart attract you?

4.  Is attraction completely separate from feelings for a person?  Or are they pretty much one and the same?



I am not quite sure that I'm getting to the heart of what I want to know.   It was hard for me to pin-point what was so different about the way that inferior Se experiences attraction and I'll be super curious to see what you guys say and also to see what higher Se users say... but first lets go with this for us so that I can fine-tune my questions.."
Can an ENFP be always needy in interactions? This is just a thought and not an absolute truth about all ENFPs. But I wanted to know from your experiences. And break this thought by sharing your perspectives.

"ENFPs are supposed to get annoyed, at best, when people start being clingy with them and become detached and give a total ""cold shoulder"" if things get really bad. The books I've read say this is because our emotional circuits are overwhelmed with our own lives, but while I can agree with this on the rare occasion I also get annoyed with clingy people when I know I'm in a very emotionally stable place.

I've been trying to think why this is for me. I think one of the core reasons is I'm on a search for self and authenticity. This search doesn't involve me obsessively tying myself to anyone, so when people do it to me I find it a bit pathetic to be harsh. I know this feeling goes into OVERDRIVE when that person asks me to 'help' them with an emotional issue, not being able to get over a failed relationship or dating pursuit is a big one, and when I offer what I know is a solution and people don't take that advice, repeat the same mistakes, or simply don't want to do what it takes to get out of their place then I have no time for that.

It's gotten to the point where I've ended friendships and, more commonly, told people if they want to talk with me or hang out with me that subject never comes up again: ever.

Any similar experiences? Or maybe you guys totally disagree with me on how I hand these situations."

"Okay, guys… this is one the other types won’t get, except for the ENTPs and here we are not wanting to look this one in the face.

Okay… today two fellow Ne doms were in my office (at different times) and both at some point went on a deep dive for their phone. Either they or I said the following: “Is it in that pocket?” “it might be in this coat pocket?” “What about this pant pocket?” “Did it get left in the car?” “Do you want me to call you?”

One of them noticed that I was scrutinizing her while she was searching.  I was seriously wondering if she was going to find it quicker than I do in the morning.  It felt like a drum roll…. She looked up at me and said “I’m sure it’s here… somewhere.”

I used to not have a purse… I guess I was even worse back then? Kind of. Maybe? My purse holds a lot of stuff to look through…

About a year ago the guy who was at the door making sure everyone hand-sanitized for Covid… he knows I’m not stupid…at least not in the typical way. He watched me rummaging through my purse every stupid morning before clocking in. He said one day when I laughed at his expression: “Why do you always have to search through your purse?”

I knew the answer because I had realized a few years ago (because my infant Si had grown a baby tooth or said a first word or had some kind of leap in development, because I’m middle aged now). What learned that I had to pay attention when I was putting something AWAY. You see putting the badge in my purse every time was a new win— I usually was searching not just my purse but everything else too… my car… my bookshelves … my bathroom… but at age 45 my Si grew up enough to realize that I knew that if I pay attention when I take the thing off and put it in the same place then it later saves me time.

So I said “I forget to put it into the same place in my purse each time.”

He said “Well, why?” with so much genuine confusion. Because he knows I’m “smart”. We used to work together before he retired and started to do volunteer work. It would be incomprehensible to understand that I’m actually really proud of myself just for getting the thing into my purse consistently.

“Because my brain doesn’t work like most people’s. I forget to place it carefully in the same place when I take it off. I’m glad to get it just into my purse.”

“Well, WHY?”

“I don’t know… I’ve been working on it for my whole life.”

Okay, so when I got it into my purse consistently it was because all of a sudden EUREKA I suddenly understood I needed to pay attention when I took it off (novel concept), right?  Can I do it again to put it not just into my purse but into a certain part of my purse?

After watching the 2 Ne doms with their purses today… I realized how crazy this is that I don’t pay attention at that moment but can I do it?  After all— my brain is obviously nowhere near my purse at the moment I’m putting that thing away.  I will try.  We look ridiculous! But it’s endearing to me, of course. 

Because you know I’m talking about phones and badges here, but every Ne dom here knows I’m not just talking about phones and badges… I’m talking about keys and glasses and cards and flipping everything else. How many years of my life are spend searching for that THING I put down a minute ago?

Alright…’fess up ya’all. And give yourself a hug while you’re at it and our partners a hug too because… of course one of these ENFPs has a husband whose job is like my husband’s… to constantly observe me looking frantically for that THING and get concerned about it with me for the many hours of our life together…let’s all scream and hug! The one thing I’m sure of: We Ne doms HAVE to have self-compassion and humor for ourselves with the “thingies” or nobody else will, that’s for sure.

Fess up!  Please do!"

This is a test that I think could be quite successful if fine-tuned.

"I was wondering about our personality type and how many of us have ADHD?

Personally have reached a point where I'm questioning self worth and where it's tied as a person, with our experiences, upbringing and where ADHD plays a role with how to handle situations.

Also, how much does the respect you receive from your parents effect how your partner respects you?

I want to get the ENFP perspective of self worth, those with or without ADHD for the comparison and also views about how family dynamics influence relationships. (Great to include family dynamic MBTI types if they are known)"

"I wanna say I think Naruto is ENFP instead of ESFP which means Ne dom instead of Se dom.

I can understand people are confusing Ne and Se because they are looking at online random descriptions of Ne and Se. However there are a lot of misconceptions online... On the original book Psychological Types created by Carl Jung we can see the clear difference between Ne and Se and I will make my argument based on the original text.

Ne and Se can look alike one another, because both of them are extraverted perception functions, so they love to interact with the external world, the world around them. Characteristics like impulsivity or reckless can be applied to both Ne and Se, both of them are avid explorers, be either of sensations (Se) or possibilities (Ne). That's why a lot of Ne doms usually are eneagrams 7, which constantly seek new experiences, challenges and can have problems with impatience and impulsiveness.

The main difference between Ne and Se is that:
1) Se looks at the external objects as what it is, concretely, realistically.
2) Ne looks at the external object as what it could be, as what it could become, expectancy, potentials, possibilities.

That main difference between Se and Ne makes Ne more Idealistic and Se more Realistic by consequence.
And before people start to say that “it is just a stereotype”, let’s take a look at what Carl Jung says in his original book: Psychological Types.

Extraverted Sensation) “No other human type can equal the extraverted sensation type in realism.”
~ Carl Jung

Extraverted Intuition) “He actually has sensations, but he is not guided by them per se, merely using them as directing-points for his distant vision.”
~ Carl Jung

ℹ The question is pretty simple: Is Naruto a Realist or he is a person that uses the world around him as directing-points for his distant vision?

The answer is pretty obvious if we look at this main difference between Se and Ne.

Naruto is not a Realist at all.
Naruto is all about believing in possibilities.

Why?

Because
1️⃣ Naruto believes the world will become better even with all of the quintessential war of nations that constantly happen.
2️⃣ Naruto believes potential cold-blooded murderers like Gaara, Pain, Obito, etc will change their behavior and stop to act so badly.
3️⃣ Naruto believes the war will stop to happen.
4️⃣ Naruto believes Sasuke will stop to be so cold and revengeful.
5️⃣ Naruto believes he will take out all the hate inside Kurama as well: “Some day I'll come after all the hate inside you as well ❤“
6️⃣ Naruto believes Sasuke will come back to Konoha
7️⃣ Naruto even believes he will change the Hyuuga clan to a better version.
8️⃣ And finally, Naruto believes he will become a Hokage

Like, come on, to name another example... When Naruto was questioned by Pain about how he would end the cycle of hatred, Naruto's answer was to simply ask him to believe in the fact that he'll find a way to bring true peace to the world. The history of shinobi shows that the peace they built rested on sacrifices, yet Naruto believed he would achieve peace with nothing more than words. Naruto is overly idealistic instead of being a realist and focusing on the tangible reality where we live by the 5 senses.

That’s why we love Naruto, right? He does not accept the world as it is by being a Realist. Naruto is the opposite, he believes in a world with better possibilities.

Naruto absolutely is not a realist (Se), he is a possibility-minded person (Ne) which turns him into that idealistic dreamer personality full of hope of a world better than it is now. What could be > What it is. This is the core of Naruto’s personality and can be shown from Classic to Shippuden!

Also, Carl Jung already explictly wrote what Se thinks about ideals related to ideas.

Extraverted Sensation) ""His ideal is the actual¹; in this respect he is considerate. He has no ideals related to ideas""
~ Carl Jung, Psychological Types

actual¹: ""existing in fact; typically as contrasted with what was intended, expected, or believed.""
~ Oxford Languages

It speaks for itself...

How could we believe this is the dominating function for Uzumaki Naruto?
No ideals related to ideas?!

Also, some people can argue all of this strong idealistic nature of Naruto comes from his Fi aux... Well, the auxiliar function does not change the cognition of the dominant function. It is actually the opposite, the auxiliar function serves the dominant function without making any claim to the autonomy of its own principle.

Auxiliar Function) ""Hence the auxiliary function is possible and useful only in so far as it serves the leading function, without making any claim to the autonomy of its own principle.""
~ Carl Jung, Psychological Types

So the auxiliar Fi should not bring the unrealistic behavior to the Se dominant function, which is the most realist of all types according yo Carl Jung.

So, the auxiliar Fi is not the one that makes Naruto idealistic in a way that make him believe in better possibilities. Yes, Fi has strong authentic opinions and believes in unconscious images, but they keep it for themselves in a silent and cold attitude and has no interest in influencing others regarding his beliefs, like Jung said 👇

Introverted Feeling) ""They reveal a delightful repose, a sympathetic parallelism, which has no desire to affect others, either to impress, influence, or change them in any way."", ""They neither shine nor reveal themselves. Since they submit the control of their lives to their subjectively orientated feeling"", ""They are mostly silent, inaccessible, and hard to understand""
~ Carl Jung, Psychological Types

On the other hand, it is the dominating Ne that makes the person keeps talking about his ideals, talking about better possibilities and inspiring others in believing in a world with better possibilities. It is the dominating Ne that irradiates the enthusiasm around better possibilities and influence others by the enthusiasm as a consequence. And this is not stereotype. It actually is totally aligned with Carl Jung’s description of Extraverted Intuition👇

Extraverted Intuition) “His capacity to inspire his fellow-men with courage, or to kindle enthusiasm for something new, is unrivalled, although he may have forsworn it by the morrow. The more powerful and vivid his intuition, the more is his subject fused and blended with the divined possibility. He animates it; he presents it in plastic shape and with convincing fire; he almost embodies it. It is not a mere histrionic display, but a fate.”
~ Carl Jung, Psychological Types

👆🏻This is totally Naruto when he starts to think in better possibilities like the 8 examples I showed above...
Naruto’s personality is grounded on this characteristic of Ne...

There are a lot of misconceptions online regarding ENFP x ESFP and regarding Ne x Se and I want to point what Carl Jung himself has to say about Ne and Se.

What do you guys think?

Cheers!"
"Personally or not if you havent met one, how you would you describe an enfp 2w1 ? Strengths, faults, fun aspects ect."
"I've read that the ENFPs have more and better coping mechanisms than most.

I'd tend to agree with that assessment. I have several, some of which I shall list here.

What are your coping mechanisms when life gets tough? What gets you stressed in the first place?

My survival skills, a typical ENFP:
1. Generally be optimistic against all evidence. Believe that things will improve
2. See even the smallest positive ray and cling to that for dear life and as the reason to believe that there's a positive spin to the whole thing
3. Keep doing things I believe in and are important to my value system. Surround myself with like-minded people. Also have a few people who think otherwise to keep perspective
4. Have deep friends who are honest to me about what I am and am not doing right, and who cheer me even when I am slipping. Friends who never abandon, no matter what. I count INTJs, ENFJs, INFJs and gasp! ENTPs in this. And yes, also INTPs in their oddly decoupled yet accepting way
5. Take on projects - like crazy. Even when I can hardly handle what's already there.
6. Help people who have real problems in life, like a child with terminal illness. It gives an important perspective of how much harder life could be and instantly makes me feel grateful for what I already have. I feel privileged and thankful for the comforts and normality I have in my life
7. Sing, dance, or go for long walks
8. Learn something new in science. It always picks me up
9. Call a friend I've not called in some time and talk
10. Call my parents
11. Help my children out with something they need, or plan ahead for something I anticipate that they will soon need
12. Play badminton
13. Write a poem or some fiction
14. Learn something hard like a new programming language or a hard Mathematics concept
15. Tidy all clothes wardrobes or do grocery shopping
16. Engage in MBTI or science or music or English grammar discussions online"
"Think about what he's done.

He was good at organizing.

He was a charmeur, in fact he was a womanizer. (now, I was not expecting this)
He was not good in math, in fact he SUCKED at math, but he was good at poetry or literature.
He was almost more a politican than a phisicyst.
He made something believable what everyone thought was not possible.
Now what is Ne if not that?

Overall I think Oppenheimer was an ENFP.
His enthusiasm won him over when he realized he could create something what others couldn't, but ultimately he realized what he's done and he called for supervision.
I think it fits the ENFP profile more than anything.

"Paradox of Me

I believe in,
Dignity, 
Character,
Virtue,
And Conviction.

I believe that,
Kindness can be your strenght,
Creativity can be made real,
Making values into rules of laws.

Justice is my core,
Tight rein on my intuition,
Running inside me,
As my very source of essence.

When the times comes,
I will do whatever it takes,
I will set the wrong right,
Leading a rebellion.

Violence hurts me,
Evil offends me,

I can either choose, 
Not to see it,
Or
Feel the weight of it.

I am soft marshmallow,
Clad in the strongest armour,
Filled with verocity and conviction.

I am kind but dangerous,
I am affectionate but hard core,
Free, yet self discipline.

When I am angry,
Get out of my way,
I will be your deadly natural disaster.

If you are lucky,
I will find reason to forgive you,
That's the paradox of me...

"Okay, so I just broke up with my boyfriend (it was ""mutual"" aka we were having issues and he talked me into breaking up) and right now I just have this hollow feeling in the pit of my stomach but I haven't actually reacted to it yet, how do you (as ENFPs) react to breakups?"

"Over the years, my closest friends have tended to be ENFPs, they are a type (I feel) I connect best with. But I've realised a recurring trend which causes me angst!! Thoughts please! 


It seems to me that my ENFPs (and ENFJs) prefer to fill their lives with people in their immediate vicinity. Once they or I are living in a different city or country, it's like I'm off their radar, and they don't tend to make any effort to maintain the friendship. I come off feeling needy by trying to keep in touch. I eventually get to the point where I feel that they mean more to me than I do to them, and I so stop trying. 


But for me (INFJ), when I invest in a friendship, it's a long term investment. I find it taxing making close friendships, but they are important to me, whether near or far.


Any tips for maintaining long distance friendships with ENFs? Am I fighting a losing battle, or am I misinterpreting this?"

"I wonder if I will just keep this thread up and fish for it every time I meet a new ENFP— feel free to add your own description when you guys meet one too.

I see from 5-8 patients a day now (used to be more— but the appointments are now longer.  I’m not a doctor.  I’m a diabetes educator/dietitian, btw.)

Anyway, I just met another ENFP and I think I will keep writing and describing us.

This particular gal was so quick— so quick that the actual things I needed to teach her (which are complex concepts) took about 1/8th of the time. I went to re-hash everything like I usually do, because usually it takes a few repetitions and I could tell she had it.

BUT the conversation— all the things she was talking about—took LOADS of time. This particular girl’s Ne combined with what I think would often be called ADHD. She cannot get enough info. She is constantly learning new things, doing art, cooking and taking care of her family. It seems like she could have even handled a great deal more— if anyone was able to give that many concepts that fast, then I think she would be the quickest person to get a Ph.D.. IF anyone taught that way and tried to put something they have ever learned in fast-track. I gotta say nobody has ever come close to learning as fast in my office but at the same time talked so much. But it’s not like it wasn’t relevant. I think it’s just more than what most people usually do in a given space of time.

She said she’s just barely gotten onto an ADHD drug (she was never really diagnosed ) and says instead of looking for her keys three times in an hour each morning it’s now down to once. Progress. She knows nothing about MBTI, but it was really fun to see.

  She was very sweet and also has been through the wringer with her health— she has a rare diseases and has had a major organ transplant, so there was a lot to do, but the education, like I said, was a breeze…. The amount of into she brought to tie into what we were discussing was impressive.  It made the conversation different to manage than the average human being or even than the average ENFP — it was fun!   And I’m cheering for her!   She does SO much!  Much more than the average person in a day.

One other thing… she was able to ask questions that were conceptual based on the ones that I explained.  I’m glad when people can just put it to use.  Well done, ENFP.

Oh and I forgot…
Also, in a class I was teaching today (a new group each time), there was an ENFP man and he knew how to ask such good conceptual questions that I couldn’t help it, I basically told the core and over-view of what was happening in the body right upfront when he asked, and it’s more complex than I usually go for this class, but to my mind—- even though everybody else had gone silent— it helped explain everything that we were then going to talk about and a lot of people enjoyed that class today— so I think after I repeated a few of those concepts with examples later, it made a big impact.  After the class, he actually gave me info on something I’ve been looking for in the community for years… so… he got to the heart of everything fast.  Loved it!  He got excited to hear it all and so I did too."

"I have a really bad death stare, to the point where people around me give me looks that suggest they think I'm doing it on purpose because I don't like them or I'm having a bad day.

The truth is my face just falls this way naturally and for me to smile or at the very least not have a death stare would require consistent thought.

As ENFPs, how does this come off to you, specifically in the context of people you don't know giving you a death stare or seeing someone with one that isn't necessarily paying attention to or focusing on you? Obviously, if you know an INTJ that has one and you're friends or in a relationship with them, things are going to be different, but from the perspective of a total stranger, I'd like to know how it registers with your type."
"Saw Oppenheimer last night.  I think it is Nolan’s masterpiece.  It was so well told! Brilliant in telling, in acting, visualization, the works.  What a great way to tell this story!  That he was already getting judged by others made it so that I didn’t have to worry about judging him myself, but could see why the decisions made were made and that the consequences were felt by most of those involved.

I wanted to see the Barbie movie this morning, but my girlfriends and I are gonna try for next week.  Greta Gerwig hopefully won’t disappoint a fellow ENFP.  I never touched Barbie’s growing up—I hate the smell of plastic.   I don’t think nostalgia is a requirement."
"Did you choose to change your last name after marriage, why or why not ? 

If you’re not married - would you want to change your last name ? 


If you’re a man how would you feel if your wife keep her last name ? Does it bother you at all or you could care less ?
