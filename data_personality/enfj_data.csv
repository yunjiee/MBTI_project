Benedox,You know you're an ENFJ when...,"We needed one of these.  :tongue:  

You know you're an ENFJ when: 

1.  Sometimes you think you're too happy for this world, so much that you have to try and tone down your enthusiasm for fear of appearing insane.  
2. You feel like you could never run out of love for people and are amazed by how much you could care for each and every one of your friends.  
3. You get confused when people doubt your love for them even when you've showered them with more attention than anyone else.  (Ahem, INFPs...) 
4. You laugh too much... and sometimes get in trouble for it.
5. People are surprised to find out that you've got a little bit of depth to your personality.  :wink: 
6.  Your music taste is all over the place.  
7. There are some people in your life that you hug every time you see them, and you don't know why...
8. When you get emotional (both happy and sad), you speak a tad metaphorically.
9.  People quote you.  
10.  People somehow relate your presence to abstract things such as sunshine, lights and stars.  
11.  You love sending your friends mail.  
12.  Sometimes you smother your loved ones with so much attention that it embarrasses them, and you just think it's funny.  (Examples of an appropriate time to do this is at birthday parties...)
13.  You just go overboard in general.

			If you guys don't mind, I'd like to mention a few ""disclaimers"" to anyone who would post a question. 

Okay first of all (and I see this mentioned a LOT!) are you sure this  person is an ENFJ? I know something I've been seeing Jawz mention a lot  lately is that other types such as ESFJ's, ESFPs, INFJs, and, I think, ENFPs get mistyped as ENFJs often.

Also, just because a person is an ENFJ don't expect them to somehow have  more insight into your ENFJ than you do. If you're in a relationship with a person, you're going to see a lot of the aspects to that person that  would motivate them in the things they do just as much as they're  jungian type or mbti.

A person's mbti is limited in what it can explain about a person, and  there are so many different aspects to a person than just 16 dimensions.  KC Tan mentioned in his answer a couple of factors such as enneagram (a  type 6 w 7 ENFJ might respond totally differently from a type 1w2 or  type 2w3 ENFJ) and also culture. 

I find the gender of a person makes a difference, sexual orientation, and also upbringing. I've never actually  seen it brought up too much in PerC, but I would imagine the  personalities on one's parents might have a bearing on how a person views a relationship, particularly when dealing with a particular type.

Also, it's not a good idea to treat the responses to a started thread   like it's the Oracle of Delphi. I mean, even if every ENFJ on the thread   says ""I would do this, this, this and this."" to a particular   situation, it doesn't necessarily mean that's how your ENFJ will respond. I find it's good to take everything stated with a grain of salt

sparkling-demeanour,"ENFJ, do you struggle to connect deeply with ESTJ & ENTJ?","I observed my ESTJ colleague try for years to connect with my boss. I kind of pity the ESTJ, as she is very enthusiastic with the idea of making her workplace a “family”. 

I’m also a Te dom like her, and I’ve also noticed our boss is on a totally different wavelength (though I don’t give a hoot personally as I’m not into this “work family” shit). 

If you’ve experienced being around EXTJs, did you find asynchronous rapport on your side? If so, what about the relations felt off to you? Do you think it’s the Te causing a barrier for you? I’m hypothesising at least on my side, it’s the Fe coming too strong on me, and the challenge of me trying to accept any of it as genuine. 

I felt like I understood/connected more with my former ESFJ boss, which hardly makes sense to me other than the potential that ESFJ is potentially the super ego of ENTJ..",https://www.personalitycafe.com//threads/enfj-do-you-struggle-to-connect-deeply-with-estj-entj.1377803/
simoninfp123,Question about a ENFJ female,"There is a very outgoing female coworker who recently started working at the university (different department, same building). She is quite attractive and appears to be very self-assured, pleasant, and gives off an impression of being outspoken and easygoing around people. However, when she first began working here, we would occasionally cross paths in the corridor, yet she wouldn't acknowledge me.
So, I decided to take the initiative and introduce myself. Things went smoothly – we engaged in some small talk. However, despite this, she continued to be a bit distant and chilly whenever we passed each other in the corridor, occasionally even ignoring me. As a result, I eventually gave up and moved on.
Surprisingly, several weeks later, she came up to me while I was with a group of colleagues at a university event and remarked, 'Oh, you're here,' initiating a conversation exclusively with me. From that point on, whenever she encounters me, she seems genuinely enthusiastic to greet me. This positive shift made me to consider asking her out.
Coincidentally, we sometimes take the same train home and have started sitting across from each other during the commute. However, during these train rides, she once again appears a bit perplexed (which is contradictory to her behavior at work with colleagues). She seems nervous, fidgety, and distant when we're seated across from each other. I even have an intuitive sense that she might be feeling uncomfortable.
Yet, back within the university environment, she engages in teasing when we meet in the corridor, playfully mimicking my behavior. Often she is at the other end of the corridor, always waving at me when she sees me.
Sometimes, she even passes by my office, pauses for a moment, and greets me with a cheerful 'helloooo, [insert my name].' However, as soon as I turn around to respond, she simply smiles at me and quickly hurries away. I'm left wondering whether this pattern of behavior aligns with common traits of an ENFJ personality. I'm posing this question because I've developed an interest in her and would like to ask her out. However, her behavior on the train is somewhat confuses me.",https://www.personalitycafe.com//threads/question-about-a-enfj-female.1376223/

radu,Why do we fall so quickly for ppl ?,"I think everyone will agree, that we as ENFJ's tend to fall in love or get emotionally attached to people very quickly. A question which has been boggling my mind lately is... WHY ?

Is it because of the seemingly neverending energy we have, which when focused on one single person makes our emotions flourish and rapidly amplifies them, thus making us quickly fall for the other person ?

Is it because we are so people focused and so in touch with them, that we can ""feel"" someone instantly and connect with them on a very deep emotional level without needing the ""proper"" time to get to know them?

Or is it because no matter how rational we try to be and block ourselves off from feeling intense emotions, deep down inside it is what makes us feel alive ? We want so much to feel something, that more often than other types, we go with our hearts even when our minds are saying no ?

For me, if I let go of my rational side, I can fall for someone in a matter of days or weeks (it's shocking I know). Most of the time I can ""control"" my emotions as not to become clingy and just be happy without wanting more. Other times, I can totally and utterly fall and my emotions take control of me. That's when I get hurt and end up feeling all the negative stuff. 

Am curious to hear other people's opinions",https://www.personalitycafe.com//threads/why-do-we-fall-so-quickly-for-ppl.124087/
OfficialGrilledCheese,How to help a very unhealthy ENFJ?,"Greeting ENFJs! I've read several threads about how awesome ENFJs are and how well you get along with INFJs. However, I can not say that this matches my experience with my ENFJ. He's clearly become a very unhealthy ENFJ I'm now sure how to help him become healthy, if anything. He's somewhat manipulative, overly critical (likes to discourage instead of encourage), and he's pretty defensive whenever he is confronted about these things. As you can assume, these actions have effected me as he used to be an amazing person. I don't know what happened to cause him to start acting this way, but if anyone has any insight as to why this could occur or what I can do to help him, it would be grateful appreciated. I read somewhere that ENFjs love verbal affirmation, so I've been trying to give him a lot lately. However, whenever I do, he doesn't accept my compliments by saying something like ""No, I'm not."" I'm thinking that he could possibly have low self esteem? It's also worth nothing that he does seem to have low/ possible underdeveloped intuition. He's certainly an ENFJ as he's tested that way and he certainly has xNFx feelings (as I'm INFJ, I'd know). He's a very strong Judger and Feeler though. Like I said previously, because of his hurtful behavior, this friend of mine is starting to become toxic and hard to be around. So if any of you have any ideas of what I can possibly do to help him, I'd greatly appreciate it.",https://www.personalitycafe.com//threads/how-to-help-a-very-unhealthy-enfj.1127754/
lastofsix,Enneagram Conundrum.... ENFJ and 8,"So, I have tested ENFJ over and over.  I have also tested equal %'s on Enneagram 8  over and over.  I was recently asked ""How does this work?  How can you be ENFJ and an 8?""  This was a fair question, and I intend on answering it, BUT....it is complicated and some of it is too intimate for me to just discuss openly.

My reluctance made me turn to co workers and friends...People who have known me for a year or more.  The over all consensus was that 8 really fits. When showed them ENFJ...they also heartily agreed.  I asked them ok..logically, this should not work.  ~I~ can see it, my co-workers can see it, but it seem that I need help explaining it to someone else. 

One very basic comparison that would like to start with is...

ENFJs are externally focused, introspective, altruistic, positive and have excellent people skills. They place utmost importance on helping others grow. They are warm and have a natural desire to be supportive and encouraging. Being charismatic and possessing excellent language skills, they do well in leadership roles. ENFJs strive to enhance the lives of their human brethren. 

EIGHTS are attracted to and appreciate power. They desire to be strong, independent, straightforward, assertive persons, who use their strength and influence to make the world a more just place to live in. They value equity, the equal distribution of power, and show a concern for the underprivileged and disenfranchised. Being your own person, doing your own thing, protecting your own is what life is all about.

I could be wrong, but I do not feel that these are mutually exclusive. I think 8 enhances and deepens some of the more primal/warrior-esque tendencies sides of ENFJ.... I understand that I ~should~ be a 2 or 9 or something more ...squishy yummy?  But I seem to be the vibrant, bouncing ball of molten lava with a smile on my face....

Are there any ENFJ's out there who have an enneagram number that seems to be contradictory? Or any other ENFJs who can see the correlation between 8 and ENFJ like I can?

FourLittleMonkeys,"Desperate infj needs help understanding love of my life, enfj","*EDITED* Desperate INFJ Needs Help Understanding Love of My Life, ENFJ

I am an INFJ who has been in love with an ENFJ for almost twenty years. And I still don't have him.  I wonder if I've made every mistake that it's possible for an INFJ to make and I need help understanding what's going on...

We grew up together and from childhood I felt a connection with him. It was as if I understood the deepest part of him in a way that no one else did. And when he looked at me, I felt he understood me, too. 

In our teens, lightning struck. Our eyes would connect, the world would fade away, and it was just he and I in a crowded room. I've never felt that with anyone else. But I was too young to realize what it meant. We never did anything about it, moved on, grew up, and I married someone else. He dated other people but never married.

For several years, I didn't see him. And yet, I never forgot him. It was as if he were a part of me; my soulmate. I was happily married.  Content. But at night, sometimes I would dream about him. I would go months without a thought of him and then I would have a dream and I would think of him for days. Usually I dreamed that I was searching for him but I could never find him.  Or if I found him, he never saw me. I came to believe that there was a connection between us that was unexplainable and I would just have to live with it. I went on with my life and tried to bury his memory deep inside. 

Last year, my life changed; I discovered my husband was cheating. An intensely loyal INFJ, I was devestated. I mourned and grieved and started to rebuild my life. Six months ago, I saw my ENFJ again for the first time in all these years. It was like magic, all over again. We sat and talked and he opened himself up to me in a way that I am only just beginning to realize was pretty special. He's always been the life of the party, the funny guy, but I've always seen beneath that to the serious, deep, real man that he is. I was blown away.  I fell even deeper in love, but for absolutely real this time. Call it the hopeless romantic INFJ part of me, but if I've loved him this long and it's only getting deeper, I can't imagine loving anyone else. 

We began to text and email and carry on a long-distance...something.  We talked about deep stuff. Real stuff. Fun stuff. Not every day but enough that we stayed in each other's lives for the next two months on a regular basis.  Usually he initiated the online conversations; we would sometimes chat for two hours without saying anything very meaningful or important. We were just completely comfortable and natural with each other. 

After two months, I began to feel that he was pulling back.The INFJ in me quickly retreated. I became scared. And I was already so deeply in love, I didn't know what to do. To be fair, he was very busy. Typical ENFJ, he was never home on any given night but was always busy ""doing"" with his hands in about a dozen pies. But I felt like he was rejecting me. My intuition told me he was pulling back.  I wondered if it was too much, too fast.  I decided to leave him alone.

I wasn't sure what was going on and began to feel that he was blowing hot and cold because he would still occasionlly seek me out online.  But he never called me on the phone or did anything that was overtly flirty. I began to go back over his behavior toward me. I wasn't convinced he viewed me any differently than any of his other friends. He had never given me any indication that he viewed me romantically. The last time I had seen him, he continued to joke and laugh and treat me like everyone else.  And yet, there was a subtle difference when he was around me. If I caught him unawares, came upon him when he wasn't expecting me, his eyes gave him away. There was an expression in them that caught at me, made me lose my breath. Like his soul looking into mine. It killed me; hooked me. 

There were other things, too. I had noticed that when we first met again, he refused to look into my eyes at all. He would talk to me or rather ""at"" me, but wouldn't make eye contact. If he did, it was a glancing blow. It was so obvious that I had begun to wonder if maybe I was wrong and he wasn't really an extrovert, but was really shy instead. But that didn't add up. With everyone else, he was completely natural and confident. It was only with me that he was different and, when I thought about it, he had acted this way right before I married my husband years before.  And there was always, always this tension within me when he was around, as if I were hyper-aware of him.  I intuitively felt like he felt it, too, but wondered if I was imagining it.  

I also noticed that he never hugged me.  Never, ever. But he hugged everyone else in a friendly, affectionate way that seemed to be a part of his personality. Just not me.  I wasn't included. I had even started to wonder if there was something wrong with me that he didn't want to hug me.

Over the next four months, our contact became less and less.  I became desperate and yet determined not to beg. I wanted him to come to me, if he wanted me. And yet, if he wanted me even a little, I would have been willing to beg. I just wanted him. But I didn't know how to get him or if he even wanted me at all. I began to wonder if I had made a serious mistake by pulling back.  I had thought he was playing games but I began to wonder if maybe he just hadn't thought I was interested. I had guarded my heart closely because I was afraid he wouldn't want it; what if he thought I didn't want his? If I were honest, I had to admit that I had carefully treated him like a friend when everything inside of me had been dying for him. 

About a month and a half ago, I saw him again. I was still deeply certain that he didn't love me, that I was destined to live my life desperately loving him and pretending that I didn't. And so, I closed down my deepest emotions and pretended that I was perfectly calm and he was just a dear, treasured friend. There were no lingering glances, no accidental touches. But still...he sought me out. I told myself he was seeking out the entire group of friends. But he sat next to me, often.  I felt torn, emotionally chaotic, absolutely certain one moment that he felt the same way for me and then just as certain the next that he didn't. Finally, he caught me alone in a quiet moment and started to ask the deep questions, the kind that we had once shared so freely. But I couldn't share; it was awkward and painful and I was in love with him and wanted ALL of him.  And so I shared very little. 

This time, when I left, he hugged me.  It wasn't a friendly, arms-around-shoulders-hug that he gives everyone else.  It was closer, intimate; I was the one to pull away, certain still that he viewed me as a friend.  It was only later that I started to wonder... He told me specifically to keep in touch with him.  I, trying to protect my heart, told him just as specifically that he could contact me if he wanted to.  He told me that he hadn't seen me online lately and he seemed awkward, hesitant, unsure...  I didn't know what this meant.  I had felt that he didn't want to talk to me as much and so I hadn't been as available to him online but he could have called me if he had wanted to.  He had my number.  But he never had.  I wasn't sure that I bought his reason.  But the way he looked at me, it was almost as if he blamed me for our lack of communication.  I was confused and didn't know what to think.  

That night, I took a chance and texted him about how much I had enjoyed seeing him.  He immediately texted back, asking if I was home.  I said no and he texted back that we would ""talk soon"" and that he wasn't very busy over the next week.  I thought, ""Ok, I've done my part,"" and I didn't reply and just waited.  I waited for a month.  Out of the blue two weeks ago, he contacted me again, wanted to know how I was doing and told me a little bit about his ""busy"" life.  We chatted online for an hour and then I initiated the goodbye, told him I loved talking with him but had to go.  The truth is, I could have sat up all night talking to him and I don't want to be that girl!  I'm so confused by him that I don't know if he wants me or not.  My INFJ intuition says yes, but my INFJ need to protect myself says maybe not.  

Why isn't he being bolder if he truly wants me?  Is he just being nice to me because I'm a friend who's gone through a rough time?  Or is he an ENFJ who's afraid of my rejection?  I will tell you that my intuition says he's in love with me.  But my logical brain keeps making me doubt because he's never actually done anything that could be considered romantic.  

Should I take a chance?  Should I open up more and be more vulnerable with him or should I just continue to wait?

Kayslay,Need advice: I screwed up…sorta,"Without getting into too many details, I had an ENFJ female ex who I actually met while she was in another relationship a few years ago.

This is a shitty thing to admit, but we had a short emotional affair but I recall her inviting things to get physical on one occasion while her partner was away. I awkwardly avoided it. She ended things I think when things started to get too intimate. (Not proud of this)

Fast forward a year and a half later, her partner who she was with (after she sort of branched to after her previous marriage of 10 years) and whom she proposed to (he said yes) left her months later. She said both were narcissists.

Soon after their breakup, I randomly contacted her out of the blue and she told me they had broken up. We connected for a few months before we ended up in a long distance relationship. She ended it 3 months later after significantly pulling away and I proceeded to chase after her right out of my life. Then contacted me another 3-4 months later because she missed me.

I proceeded to pursue her again 🤦🏽‍♂️, and we ended up the same place with her progressively shutting me down, bailing on plans if I didn’t act perfectly. I have bipolar disorder and it got triggered by the stress from my fears of abandonment. I said some really awful things to her and was sending her pages and pages of texts. I feel like she hasn’t really taken much accountability.

She is civil with me now. But told me that once it’s done with her it’s done. And I’ve heard many ENFJ’s say that….

I am asking for help with this…

Does that always mean they are done? If not, what would need to happen to repair things?

Could her offer of staying friends grow into more once I regain her trust?

Or am I better off going no contact?

I do really value her, but our relationship is nothing like it used to be. She says too much has happened.

Nobleheart,INFJ Doorslam vs ENFJ Doorslam,"The INFJ Doorslam is a classic move in which INFJs will completely cut someone out of their lives once they've had enough.  However, they rarely bother to tell the person.  They're just done.  It's a very introverted action.

5. They said that people coming from different places in the world are ruining where they live, and that the people that were born in the areas are the ones that are honest or something. 
6. They also threatened to not pay the internet bill (which the entire household uses) just because said person was not paying attention to them while arguing. 
7. They said that they are trying to make things peaceful as a person is on their deathbed in the household, and make things calm for their last days.
8. Yet they yell at said person on their death bed and even tells them that they are going to die if they won't eat, and said that black folks don't listen (dw they are black themselves) and that a white person would appreciate the efforts (the person on their death bed has dementia) 
9. They say to always love your parents and gave an example of how someone she knows was beaten so hard by her father that her skin turned blue and that she still loves and support her father.

burkeleigh,Advice on texting ENFJ male as and INFP?,"Hi hi hi,
For context I am an INFP female and I had a really incredible date with this ENFJ last week. It's funny because I really wasn't intending on even seeing him at first. We met on a dating app about 7 months ago and he always came across really sweet in messages (and he was definetly my type) but things would happen which would cause us to lose contact. In one instance he took two days to respond to me (which I later found out was because he was at an airsoft competiton?? doing outdoor ENFJ things I guess??) but it turned me off because I didn't appreciate the switch up of being completely dedicated and attentive to just suddenly disappearing. I also couldn't be sure if he was being honest, or just felt like ignoring me. I felt myself becoming insecure and those negative feelings caused me to respond less and less and then not at all.

He was very persistant, however, and eventually we did meet last week. And I left that date thinking that finally meeting him was the best choice of my life. I thought he felt the same way, as he texted me as soon as he got home and all throughout this week.

Then yesterday, his replies were very slow. I am used to him taking a bit of time inbetween replies but that day he didn't text me good morning or at all throughout the day until about 6pm. He apologized and said he hadn't seen my messages (I frequently get this kind of text from him... but it never bothered me because his apologies always seemed sincere).

He then asked me if I was busy this weekend to which I responded yes (I'm going to London tomorrow) and after a bit more small talk he asked me if there was any chance that I would be free tonight. I was immeadiatly elated and was already in the process of mentally planning what I would wear. I immeadiatly texted back saying ""i can be. did you want to hang out?""

He waited two hours to respond and then said ""I did want to hang out but Im too tired. I didnt go to the gym today either."" I was of course upset that he made me wait two hours just to say no, but I was more so sad because I actually genuinely wanted to see him (and I rarely genuinely want to go anywhere that isn't the comfort of my own home). I still forced myself to think positively though because it meant a lot to me that he even wanted to see me in the first place. I said ""Oh ok ))."" and that was that (keep in mind im leaving out the other little casual conversations we were having in between all of this, when talking to him i always try to match energy and be just as kind. he can be quite caring and complimenty and i always try to reciprocate that so he feels appreciated).

But today he hasn't texted me at all :/ no contact and its 10pm. As I mentioned, the way he replies has been something that's bothered me since we first met. I genuinely don't know what to do because I do think he is a good guy, but I just opperate under the assumption that if you like someone you talk to them throughout the day. Even if you're a bad texter, you at least send a good morning or ask how their day went? I was a bit dry with the last message I sent to him, as I was a little upset and its hard for me to hide that, but I still don't think thats any excuse?

What do you think? Is this normal? Why would he wait so long to tell me he can't see me and then just not talk to me after that? I almost want to say something about it, ask if he's ok or if he's uninterested (more so I can just stop expending mental energy towards his actions) but it's really not in my nature to do something like that and I would hate to come across as clingy or bossy. I'm not, I don't ever want to make him talk to me if he doesn't want to. I more just want to know why his texting is so unreliable. It causes me to spiral and write long essay style posts on MBTI forums .",https://www.personalitycafe.com//threads/advice-on-texting-enfj-male-as-and-infp.1374704/
ElisaFe-Nembhard,ENFJ vs ESFJ,"I need help deciding if I’m an ENFJ or an ESFJ 


1- What do you like to think about?  And what do you like to do?

I’m not sure what I like thinking about besides mbti and the universe, how we came here, and why we exist. I wonder about it a lot, with religion and stuff, which is why I’m agnostic. Things I like to do are writing stories (but I always end up never surpassing the first chapter because I don’t think it’s good enough), listening to music, feeling busy (even though I’m really lazy at home and don’t do anything). 




2- What are your biggest fears?

I seriously fear dying. Like what happens after death? Do you just die and that’s it? I want to impact people before I die so that way if I just die and that’s it, at least people will remember me for things I’ve accomplished. I don’t understand how some people don’t fear death, because I do a lot. Or how they don’t wonder where we come from or why we exist or why things work the way they do.



 3- What do you feel responsible for?

I feel like I have this responsibility to be a good daughter, have good grades, etc. My parents are strict, and they want me to have a high GPA, have all As, etc. Right now, I have a 3.5 and all my grades are As except for precalc and physics (though I have finals tomorrow so this can change). But there’s this responsibility to be what they want me to be vs. who I want to be. I feel like I’m constantly struggling with this; choosing to submit to them or be myself. 



4- What makes you happy?

I’m not sure; I don’t feel happy. I can get excited and stuff, but I’m not sure. I don’t think I’ve been genuinely happy since 6th grade. So I can’t really answer that question. 



 5- Do you like to help others?  Why?

I love helping others. I want to make an impact on people very badly. Like when I’m at my job, taking customers’ orders, delivering food to them; that makes me feel worthwhile and that I’m helping them. Compared to when they put me on dining room, I always ask to switch to a different position because it’s boring and I don’t feel like I’m helping others. I always like feeling busy and accomplished, compared to my other friends, who like to just feel relaxed. 



6-What do you do with your emotions?

Depends. I think my emotions are pretty visible on my face. I guess I’d say I feel them, though with my parents, I’m very stoic with them because of how strict they are/were. 



7- Do you have values?  Which?

My main values are being kind, not being racist, homophobic, things of that nature. Idk why, but I’m 16 and a junior in high school, and I’m pretty flexible on things, but my values are somehow debatable with others? Like ableism; I tell people the r-word is a slur, and they’ll still continue to say it and say I was the problem when I unfriend them. Or when I tell my friend that hating other POC is racist and they get all mad because I unfriend them. Like it makes no sense. When I first found out people were ableist or homophobic, I debated on unfriending them because I didn’t want to lose them, but now, I don’t really give a shit. Either I’ll unfriend them or just let the friendship die if we’re not close. I don’t understand how people can still be friends with people who are homophobic and whatnot. 



8- What do you consider before making a decision?

I like to hear others’ opinions before making a decision. I’ll go around asking friends for their opinions or I’ll look online at reviews, videos, etc. and gather intel before making a decision. I do this a lot, like pretty much 24/7. If many people say it’s good, then I’ll try it and see how it works for me. 



9- What are your wishes or goals in life?

I want to be famous, but not super famous, just known a little bit. I want to inspire people and make others think of me in a good light. I want to be talented in many areas; over the summer, I want to maybe start learning Japanese since I already know three languages, English, Spanish, and Jamaican Patois. I do wish to be happy though, but that’s kind of unattainable since happiness isn’t permanent, but only temporary. 


10- Do you think it's important to live in society?

Idk; it’s your life. People can choose what they wanna do. To live, then yeah, but the word society can vary depending on how one chooses to look at the word. 



11- They are spreading false rumors and gossip about you.  How do you feel about it and what would you do?

I’d be pissed and wonder why they did it. I probably wouldn’t confront them, unless they were my friend. Otherwise, I would just be pissed and wonder what others think of me now. 




12- Would you change/hide your opinion to fit into society?

Depends on the topic; if it’s something I care deeply about, then no. I usually kind of express my opinion on how I feel about things regardless, unless I feel self-conscious and I’m burdening others or people think I’m weird. Then I’ll just change my opinion so others won’t think I’m being weird. 



13- Someone is making fun of you publicly.  what would you do in this situation?

If it’s my friend, I laugh it off, but might feel a little insecure. If it’s someone I don’t know, I’ll probably remain quiet and shrink up and I won’t really say or do anything. 



14- What do you think/feel about the future?

I’m not sure. I don’t really think of it that much; maybe it will be better. Hopefully. The closest I get to thinking about it is what my life will be like and how I’ll be. 



15- What irritates you?

Depends on the situation ngl. I feel like for many questions, it depends on the situation, so there’s no clearcut answer. But things that usually irritate me are throat noises people make when their throat itches, sniffling, excessive nose blowing, things like that. 



16- How do you see yourself?

Sarcastic, insecure, imaginative, naive, shy, loud, outspoken, bold.


17- What would be an ideal world for you?

 A society where we all live in harmony. A society where slavery, racism, colonization never existed. We would all have our original languages and cultures instead of being forced into new ones. There would be no hate, but only love. 



18- Is the object (external facts) or the subject (internal opinions and assumptions) more important to you?

Probably external facts.



19- Do you look for meaning in life internally or externally?

Probably externally, since I look outward for answers about what meaning means.",https://www.personalitycafe.com//threads/enfj-vs-esfj.1375026/

Moonshine,Who are ENFJs?  - From an INFP,"Hello everyone,

I am an INFP.  For me, friends are either very close, or they are merely an acquaintance.  My close friends are usually ENFP, INFP, and INFJ.  

There is something I love about NF's.  I have been wondering why I haven't had any close friends who are ENFJ.  

I have two ""potential friends"" at the moment who are ENFJs.  I feel their NF-ness, which makes me want to become closer friends.  But, it is almost as if they don't have this need.  Is this true?  Do ENFJ's not really  need close friends?  They seem to have lots of friends, on a ""medium-level"".  They connect to people easily, and they are not superficial, but they don't seem to go as deep as INFPs...  They stop at a certain level.  Are they happy with this level?

Are ENFJ's very conscious of what behaviour is ""appropriate"", and what is ""inappropriate""?  How important to you is acting appropriately?  I think that the IP vs. EJ difference I feel means that we are different in our impressions of what is ""appropriate""... 

You have Fe first.  I have Fi first.  We both want to please people because we are NF's.  But, this desire is ""different""...  I have no desire to conform.  I take pleasure in being different, thinking outside of the box, and finding my own rules for everything in life.  Whereas ENFJ's are more aware of the box...  They are more aware of what is appropriate.  And they seem to expect me to act inside the box...  Something like that?

And their Ti...  Does your Ti allow you to avoid topics?  Does it allow you to steer conversations into a direction that you feel more comfortable with?  I try to be direct, addressing something ""inappropriately intense"".  And she just steers it to where she feels comfortable...  Something like that.  

I would love to hear what you think of INFPs, and if you can explain the difference between them.  I would be grateful for any insight you have.

I would love to be close friends with an ENFJ because I feel it would help me understand the whole range of NF-ness.  However, maybe they just aren't the ""close friend"" type, at least not according to my definition of ""close friend"".  If they aren't, I am probably better to just give up on this idea, and just let them be the medium-level friend they want to be.",https://www.personalitycafe.com//threads/who-are-enfjs-from-an-infp.148686/

Optimus,Being ENFJ and having ADD (ADHD),"Hi all,

Its been awhile since I've been here. I've recently been diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. And it made me think. Could it be quite possible that most ENFJs have ADHD (Samething as ADD just a newer term).

Because here's the thing...

If you have ADHD or you're an ENFJ you probably:

1.) Have trouble listening (but a great listener, but likes to cut to the chase since we have a natural tendency to understand others quickly and on a whim) to others and prefer having to be the speaker (being a mentor and all).

2.) Impulsivity (randomly jumpy, and just random in general)
       -Commit to something and go... oh crap later on.
       -Being hyper as a means to get attention and for the sake of elevating the tone and mood.

3.) Always ""on the go"" or ""being all over the place"" or function as though being run by a ""motor""

4.) Easily distracted.

5.) Sensitive to criticism.

6.) Always being told that you're either weird or just really out there.

I just thought there might be some kind of correlation.",https://www.personalitycafe.com//threads/being-enfj-and-having-add-adhd.29115/

Dafnie Nacius,I'm an ENFJ... but I'm an ACCOUNTING Major?,"AND I QUOTE:

""This longing for the perfect carries over into the careers of ENFJ's, who experience some degree of restlessness whatever their jobs. And, as with ENFP's, ENFJ's have a wide range of occupations which offer success. Being verbally adept, ENFJ's contribute to an unusual level dealing with people, particularly face to face; the media, the ministry, and stage and screen are populated successful ENFJ's. They make superior therapists, charismatic teachers, excellent executives, personalized salespersons. Areas that would not permit utilization of the intereactional talents of the ENFJ's, for example, accounting, should be avoided, otherwise, almost any people to people occupation where personal, sustained contact is involved capitalizes on the personality of the ENFJ.""

I'm currently an accounting major and I love my major but I've been having a weird 'gut' feeling about it. Accountants are typically very technical, to themselves and not really into interacting with people. Of course, in this day and age things are changing and accountants need great managing skills to succeed way beyond the norm. I've met lots of accountants, auditors, tax accountants who are not like your typical 'stay in the background and crunch numbers types'. 

Even though the field is changing, I still feel like I'm missing something in my major. I absolutely love people. I want to help people and make a difference in this world. The thought of being stuck behind a cubicle preparing tax statements for a corporation or in a room with an audit team checking through invoices made me go nuts!! I've been searching through these personality tests and careers to see how can I still follow my dream of using my talents in accounting to help people and finally concluded that I should look into becoming a Financial Advisor or Director of some sort of Financial Literacy Program. I want to help people plan and figure out how they can save money, manage their finances and maybe even do their taxes here and there. I wouldn't mind being a CPA where I can work on statements and taxes but I also want to advise. I even found some jobs with the Department of Treasury that were centered around spreading financial literacy and I was like - ding ding ding!! Score!! My accounting college focuses more on preparing students to work for large accounting firms so I had to dig deep for this kind of information.

If there is another ENFJ out there who's interested in a field that doesn't typically fit with their personality type - continue to do research. There is a career path out there for you. You can mix-and-match your talents with your career goals and make it work for you. It might involve you completely changing your major or it might involve you taking a path that's different from your colleagues (like me!). Most of my friends are going into Public Accounting - which is great... but not really what I want to do.

Another note - I am heavily involved in my church. I LOVE ministry. I LOVE performing and acting and music. I am a singer, guitarist, clarinet player and actress. You can imagine how aggravated I was when I had to slow down on my involvement in my choir when my accounting classes became to difficult to handle lol. I also love leading people. Most accountants prefer being behind the scenes. People like me who become accountants move on past their staff accountant levels to pick up roles as Controllers of companies etc etc. I don't mind working in the corporate world too much, but I would prefer to use my talents with a ministry or non-profit organization. It could even be a for-profit company as long as they have a mission of some sort to help individuals. Heck, I wouldn't even mind starting up my own thing! I have an entrepreneurial spirit too.

Tihomir,"I am an INFP and my Enfj Girlfriend broke up with me without telling me the reason, can anybody help me with what should I do.","My enfj girlfriend of 3 years broke up with me this past week and she never told me a direct answer why ( we had a lot of very small problems that don't seem very big ), but we did have a conversation again about those said problems but in a different manner, I think she wanted to break up with me then aswell but when i told her i loved her more the anything and that I am willing to change and I will get on with my schoolwork and get a job ( I am in college and im trying to move into her city where she goes to college aswell and where I will got to college next year and I want to make some extra money). 

2 months later she breaks up with me anyway with again all small problems and never telling me what the issue actualy was. I was sure I was doing everything correct and I as an INFP wanted to apologize as soon as possible thinking that she will close me out forever if I don't do it quickly. I ended up pushing her into a corner and she almost said she wanted to correct things but then out of a sudden changed her mind again 5 minutes later. 

After that conversation 2 days have passed which i have spent going through our entire relationship and examining what the issue was and I realized that she was giving me all this attention and when I was too focused on fixing the issue I had with me not having a job to make some money I neglected her a lot and I realized all the pain I caused to her by doing that. I had some childhood trauma and it was hard for me to show my emotions because of my insecurities and I was getting over them but very slowly thinking it shouldn't be a priority. 

I always showed her a lot of emotion when we were together alone and when we were together every single day, but when college starts then we're away and don't see each other for 5 days. We don't text a lot because we both would rather talk face to face and I felt very bad for not doing that for some time. That's why i was focused on moving there as soon as possible so we could see each other every day. 

I realized she broke up with me because of the neglect because I am a very emotional person and when I talked to my friends about the breakup I told them all of my issues out in the open ( which i always hid ) and I kept telling everyone how much I loved her and that I couldn't live without her and that she is the girl of my dreams. Then yesterday I noticed what an idiot I was... 

I kept telling everyone else what a wonderful person and a great lover my girlfriend is and I never said it enough to herself. I know her to my core and I always knew when she was upset and it always broke my heart but she never showed that she was upset when she would be upset because of me and that's why I never read her correctly then. Now i feel apsolutely miserable and I miss talking to her and telling to her how much I love her. 

I wish i could just make this realization 2 weeks ago. I have so much love for her and all i want to do is tell her every day of how sorry I was and I want to tell her every day how much I love and cherish her and everything she does for me and everyone around her. I know she knows I love her very much and I know she loves me very much. 

I want to show her that i've changed and I want to apologize to her but I know that i backed her up in a corner because of my own stupidity and I am afraid to talk to her again because I don't want her to see me pushing her into something she isn't ready for. But at the same time If i wait too long I am afraid that she will close herself to me and that I will lose her forever. 

I know there is a party coming up where she and I will definetly be there ( we share the same friend circle ) And I want to tell her and show her how much I changed and how much I love her and how I am sorry that i misunderstood her and that she shouldn't doubt herself with anything and that I wish I could tell her I love her and hug her every day. I'm friends with the big party host and I want to surprise her by singing to her infront of everybody with the song from one of her favorite movies 10 things I hate about you ( I am very shy when it comes to my singing and barely sang to her when we were alone ). But that is very risky because i am scared that if I scare her off then then I know my window is closed.",https://www.personalitycafe.com//threads/i-am-an-infp-and-my-enfj-girlfriend-broke-up-with-me-without-telling-me-the-reason-can-anybody-help-me-with-what-should-i-do.1372508/
