Benedox,You know you're an ENFJ when...,"We needed one of these.  :tongue:  

You know you're an ENFJ when: 

1.  Sometimes you think you're too happy for this world, so much that you have to try and tone down your enthusiasm for fear of appearing insane.  
2. You feel like you could never run out of love for people and are amazed by how much you could care for each and every one of your friends.  
3. You get confused when people doubt your love for them even when you've showered them with more attention than anyone else.  (Ahem, INFPs...) 
4. You laugh too much... and sometimes get in trouble for it.
5. People are surprised to find out that you've got a little bit of depth to your personality.  :wink: 
6.  Your music taste is all over the place.  
7. There are some people in your life that you hug every time you see them, and you don't know why...
8. When you get emotional (both happy and sad), you speak a tad metaphorically.
9.  People quote you.  
10.  People somehow relate your presence to abstract things such as sunshine, lights and stars.  
11.  You love sending your friends mail.  
12.  Sometimes you smother your loved ones with so much attention that it embarrasses them, and you just think it's funny.  (Examples of an appropriate time to do this is at birthday parties...)
13.  You just go overboard in general.

			If you guys don't mind, I'd like to mention a few ""disclaimers"" to anyone who would post a question. 

Okay first of all (and I see this mentioned a LOT!) are you sure this  person is an ENFJ? I know something I've been seeing Jawz mention a lot  lately is that other types such as ESFJ's, ESFPs, INFJs, and, I think, ENFPs get mistyped as ENFJs often.

Also, just because a person is an ENFJ don't expect them to somehow have  more insight into your ENFJ than you do. If you're in a relationship with a person, you're going to see a lot of the aspects to that person that  would motivate them in the things they do just as much as they're  jungian type or mbti.

A person's mbti is limited in what it can explain about a person, and  there are so many different aspects to a person than just 16 dimensions.  KC Tan mentioned in his answer a couple of factors such as enneagram (a  type 6 w 7 ENFJ might respond totally differently from a type 1w2 or  type 2w3 ENFJ) and also culture. 

I find the gender of a person makes a difference, sexual orientation, and also upbringing. I've never actually  seen it brought up too much in PerC, but I would imagine the  personalities on one's parents might have a bearing on how a person views a relationship, particularly when dealing with a particular type.

Also, it's not a good idea to treat the responses to a started thread   like it's the Oracle of Delphi. I mean, even if every ENFJ on the thread   says ""I would do this, this, this and this."" to a particular   situation, it doesn't necessarily mean that's how your ENFJ will respond. I find it's good to take everything stated with a grain of salt

simoninfp123,Question about a ENFJ female,"There is a very outgoing female coworker who recently started working at the university (different department, same building). She is quite attractive and appears to be very self-assured, pleasant, and gives off an impression of being outspoken and easygoing around people. However, when she first began working here, we would occasionally cross paths in the corridor, yet she wouldn't acknowledge me.
So, I decided to take the initiative and introduce myself. Things went smoothly ??we engaged in some small talk. However, despite this, she continued to be a bit distant and chilly whenever we passed each other in the corridor, occasionally even ignoring me. As a result, I eventually gave up and moved on.
Surprisingly, several weeks later, she came up to me while I was with a group of colleagues at a university event and remarked, 'Oh, you're here,' initiating a conversation exclusively with me. From that point on, whenever she encounters me, she seems genuinely enthusiastic to greet me. This positive shift made me to consider asking her out.
Coincidentally, we sometimes take the same train home and have started sitting across from each other during the commute. However, during these train rides, she once again appears a bit perplexed (which is contradictory to her behavior at work with colleagues). She seems nervous, fidgety, and distant when we're seated across from each other. I even have an intuitive sense that she might be feeling uncomfortable.
Yet, back within the university environment, she engages in teasing when we meet in the corridor, playfully mimicking my behavior. Often she is at the other end of the corridor, always waving at me when she sees me.
Sometimes, she even passes by my office, pauses for a moment, and greets me with a cheerful 'helloooo, [insert my name].' However, as soon as I turn around to respond, she simply smiles at me and quickly hurries away. I'm left wondering whether this pattern of behavior aligns with common traits of an ENFJ personality. I'm posing this question because I've developed an interest in her and would like to ask her out. However, her behavior on the train is somewhat confuses me.",https://www.personalitycafe.com//threads/question-about-a-enfj-female.1376223/,,,,,,,,,,,

radu,Why do we fall so quickly for ppl ?,"I think everyone will agree, that we as ENFJ's tend to fall in love or get emotionally attached to people very quickly. A question which has been boggling my mind lately is... WHY ?

Is it because of the seemingly neverending energy we have, which when focused on one single person makes our emotions flourish and rapidly amplifies them, thus making us quickly fall for the other person ?

Is it because we are so people focused and so in touch with them, that we can ""feel"" someone instantly and connect with them on a very deep emotional level without needing the ""proper"" time to get to know them?

Or is it because no matter how rational we try to be and block ourselves off from feeling intense emotions, deep down inside it is what makes us feel alive ? We want so much to feel something, that more often than other types, we go with our hearts even when our minds are saying no ?

For me, if I let go of my rational side, I can fall for someone in a matter of days or weeks (it's shocking I know). Most of the time I can ""control"" my emotions as not to become clingy and just be happy without wanting more. Other times, I can totally and utterly fall and my emotions take control of me. That's when I get hurt and end up feeling all the negative stuff. 

Am curious to hear other people's opinions",https://www.personalitycafe.com//threads/why-do-we-fall-so-quickly-for-ppl.124087/,,,,,,,,,,,
OfficialGrilledCheese,How to help a very unhealthy ENFJ?,"Greeting ENFJs! I've read several threads about how awesome ENFJs are and how well you get along with INFJs. However, I can not say that this matches my experience with my ENFJ. He's clearly become a very unhealthy ENFJ I'm now sure how to help him become healthy, if anything. He's somewhat manipulative, overly critical (likes to discourage instead of encourage), and he's pretty defensive whenever he is confronted about these things. As you can assume, these actions have effected me as he used to be an amazing person. I don't know what happened to cause him to start acting this way, but if anyone has any insight as to why this could occur or what I can do to help him, it would be grateful appreciated. I read somewhere that ENFjs love verbal affirmation, so I've been trying to give him a lot lately. However, whenever I do, he doesn't accept my compliments by saying something like ""No, I'm not."" I'm thinking that he could possibly have low self esteem? It's also worth nothing that he does seem to have low/ possible underdeveloped intuition. He's certainly an ENFJ as he's tested that way and he certainly has xNFx feelings (as I'm INFJ, I'd know). He's a very strong Judger and Feeler though. Like I said previously, because of his hurtful behavior, this friend of mine is starting to become toxic and hard to be around. So if any of you have any ideas of what I can possibly do to help him, I'd greatly appreciate it.",https://www.personalitycafe.com//threads/how-to-help-a-very-unhealthy-enfj.1127754/,,,,,,,,,,,
lastofsix,Enneagram Conundrum.... ENFJ and 8,"So, I have tested ENFJ over and over.  I have also tested equal %'s on Enneagram 8  over and over.  I was recently asked ""How does this work?  How can you be ENFJ and an 8?""  This was a fair question, and I intend on answering it, BUT....it is complicated and some of it is too intimate for me to just discuss openly.

My reluctance made me turn to co workers and friends...People who have known me for a year or more.  The over all consensus was that 8 really fits. When showed them ENFJ...they also heartily agreed.  I asked them ok..logically, this should not work.  ~I~ can see it, my co-workers can see it, but it seem that I need help explaining it to someone else. 

One very basic comparison that would like to start with is...

ENFJs are externally focused, introspective, altruistic, positive and have excellent people skills. They place utmost importance on helping others grow. They are warm and have a natural desire to be supportive and encouraging. Being charismatic and possessing excellent language skills, they do well in leadership roles. ENFJs strive to enhance the lives of their human brethren. 

EIGHTS are attracted to and appreciate power. They desire to be strong, independent, straightforward, assertive persons, who use their strength and influence to make the world a more just place to live in. They value equity, the equal distribution of power, and show a concern for the underprivileged and disenfranchised. Being your own person, doing your own thing, protecting your own is what life is all about.

I could be wrong, but I do not feel that these are mutually exclusive. I think 8 enhances and deepens some of the more primal/warrior-esque tendencies sides of ENFJ.... I understand that I ~should~ be a 2 or 9 or something more ...squishy yummy?  But I seem to be the vibrant, bouncing ball of molten lava with a smile on my face....

Are there any ENFJ's out there who have an enneagram number that seems to be contradictory? Or any other ENFJs who can see the correlation between 8 and ENFJ like I can?

FourLittleMonkeys,"Desperate infj needs help understanding love of my life, enfj","*EDITED* Desperate INFJ Needs Help Understanding Love of My Life, ENFJ

I am an INFJ who has been in love with an ENFJ for almost twenty years. And I still don't have him.  I wonder if I've made every mistake that it's possible for an INFJ to make and I need help understanding what's going on...

We grew up together and from childhood I felt a connection with him. It was as if I understood the deepest part of him in a way that no one else did. And when he looked at me, I felt he understood me, too. 

In our teens, lightning struck. Our eyes would connect, the world would fade away, and it was just he and I in a crowded room. I've never felt that with anyone else. But I was too young to realize what it meant. We never did anything about it, moved on, grew up, and I married someone else. He dated other people but never married.

For several years, I didn't see him. And yet, I never forgot him. It was as if he were a part of me; my soulmate. I was happily married.  Content. But at night, sometimes I would dream about him. I would go months without a thought of him and then I would have a dream and I would think of him for days. Usually I dreamed that I was searching for him but I could never find him.  Or if I found him, he never saw me. I came to believe that there was a connection between us that was unexplainable and I would just have to live with it. I went on with my life and tried to bury his memory deep inside. 

Last year, my life changed; I discovered my husband was cheating. An intensely loyal INFJ, I was devestated. I mourned and grieved and started to rebuild my life. Six months ago, I saw my ENFJ again for the first time in all these years. It was like magic, all over again. We sat and talked and he opened himself up to me in a way that I am only just beginning to realize was pretty special. He's always been the life of the party, the funny guy, but I've always seen beneath that to the serious, deep, real man that he is. I was blown away.  I fell even deeper in love, but for absolutely real this time. Call it the hopeless romantic INFJ part of me, but if I've loved him this long and it's only getting deeper, I can't imagine loving anyone else. 

We began to text and email and carry on a long-distance...something.  We talked about deep stuff. Real stuff. Fun stuff. Not every day but enough that we stayed in each other's lives for the next two months on a regular basis.  Usually he initiated the online conversations; we would sometimes chat for two hours without saying anything very meaningful or important. We were just completely comfortable and natural with each other. 

After two months, I began to feel that he was pulling back.The INFJ in me quickly retreated. I became scared. And I was already so deeply in love, I didn't know what to do. To be fair, he was very busy. Typical ENFJ, he was never home on any given night but was always busy ""doing"" with his hands in about a dozen pies. But I felt like he was rejecting me. My intuition told me he was pulling back.  I wondered if it was too much, too fast.  I decided to leave him alone.

I wasn't sure what was going on and began to feel that he was blowing hot and cold because he would still occasionlly seek me out online.  But he never called me on the phone or did anything that was overtly flirty. I began to go back over his behavior toward me. I wasn't convinced he viewed me any differently than any of his other friends. He had never given me any indication that he viewed me romantically. The last time I had seen him, he continued to joke and laugh and treat me like everyone else.  And yet, there was a subtle difference when he was around me. If I caught him unawares, came upon him when he wasn't expecting me, his eyes gave him away. There was an expression in them that caught at me, made me lose my breath. Like his soul looking into mine. It killed me; hooked me. 

There were other things, too. I had noticed that when we first met again, he refused to look into my eyes at all. He would talk to me or rather ""at"" me, but wouldn't make eye contact. If he did, it was a glancing blow. It was so obvious that I had begun to wonder if maybe I was wrong and he wasn't really an extrovert, but was really shy instead. But that didn't add up. With everyone else, he was completely natural and confident. It was only with me that he was different and, when I thought about it, he had acted this way right before I married my husband years before.  And there was always, always this tension within me when he was around, as if I were hyper-aware of him.  I intuitively felt like he felt it, too, but wondered if I was imagining it.  

I also noticed that he never hugged me.  Never, ever. But he hugged everyone else in a friendly, affectionate way that seemed to be a part of his personality. Just not me.  I wasn't included. I had even started to wonder if there was something wrong with me that he didn't want to hug me.

Over the next four months, our contact became less and less.  I became desperate and yet determined not to beg. I wanted him to come to me, if he wanted me. And yet, if he wanted me even a little, I would have been willing to beg. I just wanted him. But I didn't know how to get him or if he even wanted me at all. I began to wonder if I had made a serious mistake by pulling back.  I had thought he was playing games but I began to wonder if maybe he just hadn't thought I was interested. I had guarded my heart closely because I was afraid he wouldn't want it; what if he thought I didn't want his? If I were honest, I had to admit that I had carefully treated him like a friend when everything inside of me had been dying for him. 

About a month and a half ago, I saw him again. I was still deeply certain that he didn't love me, that I was destined to live my life desperately loving him and pretending that I didn't. And so, I closed down my deepest emotions and pretended that I was perfectly calm and he was just a dear, treasured friend. There were no lingering glances, no accidental touches. But still...he sought me out. I told myself he was seeking out the entire group of friends. But he sat next to me, often.  I felt torn, emotionally chaotic, absolutely certain one moment that he felt the same way for me and then just as certain the next that he didn't. Finally, he caught me alone in a quiet moment and started to ask the deep questions, the kind that we had once shared so freely. But I couldn't share; it was awkward and painful and I was in love with him and wanted ALL of him.  And so I shared very little. 

This time, when I left, he hugged me.  It wasn't a friendly, arms-around-shoulders-hug that he gives everyone else.  It was closer, intimate; I was the one to pull away, certain still that he viewed me as a friend.  It was only later that I started to wonder... He told me specifically to keep in touch with him.  I, trying to protect my heart, told him just as specifically that he could contact me if he wanted to.  He told me that he hadn't seen me online lately and he seemed awkward, hesitant, unsure...  I didn't know what this meant.  I had felt that he didn't want to talk to me as much and so I hadn't been as available to him online but he could have called me if he had wanted to.  He had my number.  But he never had.  I wasn't sure that I bought his reason.  But the way he looked at me, it was almost as if he blamed me for our lack of communication.  I was confused and didn't know what to think.  

That night, I took a chance and texted him about how much I had enjoyed seeing him.  He immediately texted back, asking if I was home.  I said no and he texted back that we would ""talk soon"" and that he wasn't very busy over the next week.  I thought, ""Ok, I've done my part,"" and I didn't reply and just waited.  I waited for a month.  Out of the blue two weeks ago, he contacted me again, wanted to know how I was doing and told me a little bit about his ""busy"" life.  We chatted online for an hour and then I initiated the goodbye, told him I loved talking with him but had to go.  The truth is, I could have sat up all night talking to him and I don't want to be that girl!  I'm so confused by him that I don't know if he wants me or not.  My INFJ intuition says yes, but my INFJ need to protect myself says maybe not.  

Why isn't he being bolder if he truly wants me?  Is he just being nice to me because I'm a friend who's gone through a rough time?  Or is he an ENFJ who's afraid of my rejection?  I will tell you that my intuition says he's in love with me.  But my logical brain keeps making me doubt because he's never actually done anything that could be considered romantic.  

Should I take a chance?  Should I open up more and be more vulnerable with him or should I just continue to wait?

Kayslay,Need advice: I screwed up?¶sorta,"Without getting into too many details, I had an ENFJ female ex who I actually met while she was in another relationship a few years ago.

This is a shitty thing to admit, but we had a short emotional affair but I recall her inviting things to get physical on one occasion while her partner was away. I awkwardly avoided it. She ended things I think when things started to get too intimate. (Not proud of this)

Fast forward a year and a half later, her partner who she was with (after she sort of branched to after her previous marriage of 10 years) and whom she proposed to (he said yes) left her months later. She said both were narcissists.

Soon after their breakup, I randomly contacted her out of the blue and she told me they had broken up. We connected for a few months before we ended up in a long distance relationship. She ended it 3 months later after significantly pulling away and I proceeded to chase after her right out of my life. Then contacted me another 3-4 months later because she missed me.

I proceeded to pursue her again ?§¶?èΩ?ç‚?Ô∏? and we ended up the same place with her progressively shutting me down, bailing on plans if I didn?ôt act perfectly. I have bipolar disorder and it got triggered by the stress from my fears of abandonment. I said some really awful things to her and was sending her pages and pages of texts. I feel like she hasn?ôt really taken much accountability.

She is civil with me now. But told me that once it?ôs done with her it?ôs done. And I?ôve heard many ENFJ?ôs say that??

I am asking for help with this??
Does that always mean they are done? If not, what would need to happen to repair things?

Could her offer of staying friends grow into more once I regain her trust?

Or am I better off going no contact?

I do really value her, but our relationship is nothing like it used to be. She says too much has happened.

Nobleheart,INFJ Doorslam vs ENFJ Doorslam,"The INFJ Doorslam is a classic move in which INFJs will completely cut someone out of their lives once they've had enough.  However, they rarely bother to tell the person.  They're just done.  It's a very introverted action.

3. They threatened to destroy the computer of said person they were yelling at as they were ignoring them while they were yelling at them. 
3b. Has actually destroyed the phone of her husband once by throwing it out the window as she suspected him of cheating (he WASN'T!!!!!!!!!!!!) 
4. They think Millennials are the worst generation and that they are ruining the world compared to how things were in the past as they claimed back then someone's word was someone's word or something.
5. They said that people coming from different places in the world are ruining where they live, and that the people that were born in the areas are the ones that are honest or something. 
6. They also threatened to not pay the internet bill (which the entire household uses) just because said person was not paying attention to them while arguing. 
7. They said that they are trying to make things peaceful as a person is on their deathbed in the household, and make things calm for their last days.
8. Yet they yell at said person on their death bed and even tells them that they are going to die if they won't eat, and said that black folks don't listen (dw they are black themselves) and that a white person would appreciate the efforts (the person on their death bed has dementia) 
9. They say to always love your parents and gave an example of how someone she knows was beaten so hard by her father that her skin turned blue and that she still loves and support her father. 
10. She is the cleanest person ever, and in a hotel the maids even said that they have never seen a person as clean as her.

burkeleigh,Advice on texting ENFJ male as and INFP?,"Hi hi hi,
For context I am an INFP female and I had a really incredible date with this ENFJ last week. It's funny because I really wasn't intending on even seeing him at first. We met on a dating app about 7 months ago and he always came across really sweet in messages (and he was definetly my type) but things would happen which would cause us to lose contact. In one instance he took two days to respond to me (which I later found out was because he was at an airsoft competiton?? doing outdoor ENFJ things I guess??) but it turned me off because I didn't appreciate the switch up of being completely dedicated and attentive to just suddenly disappearing. I also couldn't be sure if he was being honest, or just felt like ignoring me. I felt myself becoming insecure and those negative feelings caused me to respond less and less and then not at all.

He was very persistant, however, and eventually we did meet last week. And I left that date thinking that finally meeting him was the best choice of my life. I thought he felt the same way, as he texted me as soon as he got home and all throughout this week.

Then yesterday, his replies were very slow. I am used to him taking a bit of time inbetween replies but that day he didn't text me good morning or at all throughout the day until about 6pm. He apologized and said he hadn't seen my messages (I frequently get this kind of text from him... but it never bothered me because his apologies always seemed sincere).

He then asked me if I was busy this weekend to which I responded yes (I'm going to London tomorrow) and after a bit more small talk he asked me if there was any chance that I would be free tonight. I was immeadiatly elated and was already in the process of mentally planning what I would wear. I immeadiatly texted back saying ""i can be. did you want to hang out?""

He waited two hours to respond and then said ""I did want to hang out but Im too tired. I didnt go to the gym today either."" I was of course upset that he made me wait two hours just to say no, but I was more so sad because I actually genuinely wanted to see him (and I rarely genuinely want to go anywhere that isn't the comfort of my own home). I still forced myself to think positively though because it meant a lot to me that he even wanted to see me in the first place. I said ""Oh ok ))."" and that was that (keep in mind im leaving out the other little casual conversations we were having in between all of this, when talking to him i always try to match energy and be just as kind. he can be quite caring and complimenty and i always try to reciprocate that so he feels appreciated).

But today he hasn't texted me at all :/ no contact and its 10pm. As I mentioned, the way he replies has been something that's bothered me since we first met. I genuinely don't know what to do because I do think he is a good guy, but I just opperate under the assumption that if you like someone you talk to them throughout the day. Even if you're a bad texter, you at least send a good morning or ask how their day went? I was a bit dry with the last message I sent to him, as I was a little upset and its hard for me to hide that, but I still don't think thats any excuse?

What do you think? Is this normal? Why would he wait so long to tell me he can't see me and then just not talk to me after that? I almost want to say something about it, ask if he's ok or if he's uninterested (more so I can just stop expending mental energy towards his actions) but it's really not in my nature to do something like that and I would hate to come across as clingy or bossy. I'm not, I don't ever want to make him talk to me if he doesn't want to. I more just want to know why his texting is so unreliable. It causes me to spiral and write long essay style posts on MBTI forums .",https://www.personalitycafe.com//threads/advice-on-texting-enfj-male-as-and-infp.1374704/,,,,,,,,,,,
ElisaFe-Nembhard,ENFJ vs ESFJ,"I need help deciding if I?ôm an ENFJ or an ESFJ 


1- What do you like to think about?  And what do you like to do?

I?ôm not sure what I like thinking about besides mbti and the universe, how we came here, and why we exist. I wonder about it a lot, with religion and stuff, which is why I?ôm agnostic. Things I like to do are writing stories (but I always end up never surpassing the first chapter because I don?ôt think it?ôs good enough), listening to music, feeling busy (even though I?ôm really lazy at home and don?ôt do anything). 




2- What are your biggest fears?

I seriously fear dying. Like what happens after death? Do you just die and that?ôs it? I want to impact people before I die so that way if I just die and that?ôs it, at least people will remember me for things I?ôve accomplished. I don?ôt understand how some people don?ôt fear death, because I do a lot. Or how they don?ôt wonder where we come from or why we exist or why things work the way they do.



 3- What do you feel responsible for?

I feel like I have this responsibility to be a good daughter, have good grades, etc. My parents are strict, and they want me to have a high GPA, have all As, etc. Right now, I have a 3.5 and all my grades are As except for precalc and physics (though I have finals tomorrow so this can change). But there?ôs this responsibility to be what they want me to be vs. who I want to be. I feel like I?ôm constantly struggling with this; choosing to submit to them or be myself. 



4- What makes you happy?

I?ôm not sure; I don?ôt feel happy. I can get excited and stuff, but I?ôm not sure. I don?ôt think I?ôve been genuinely happy since 6th grade. So I can?ôt really answer that question. 



 5- Do you like to help others?  Why?

I love helping others. I want to make an impact on people very badly. Like when I?ôm at my job, taking customers??orders, delivering food to them; that makes me feel worthwhile and that I?ôm helping them. Compared to when they put me on dining room, I always ask to switch to a different position because it?ôs boring and I don?ôt feel like I?ôm helping others. I always like feeling busy and accomplished, compared to my other friends, who like to just feel relaxed. 



6-What do you do with your emotions?

Depends. I think my emotions are pretty visible on my face. I guess I?ôd say I feel them, though with my parents, I?ôm very stoic with them because of how strict they are/were. 



7- Do you have values?  Which?

My main values are being kind, not being racist, homophobic, things of that nature. Idk why, but I?ôm 16 and a junior in high school, and I?ôm pretty flexible on things, but my values are somehow debatable with others? Like ableism; I tell people the r-word is a slur, and they?ôll still continue to say it and say I was the problem when I unfriend them. Or when I tell my friend that hating other POC is racist and they get all mad because I unfriend them. Like it makes no sense. When I first found out people were ableist or homophobic, I debated on unfriending them because I didn?ôt want to lose them, but now, I don?ôt really give a shit. Either I?ôll unfriend them or just let the friendship die if we?ôre not close. I don?ôt understand how people can still be friends with people who are homophobic and whatnot. 



8- What do you consider before making a decision?

I like to hear others??opinions before making a decision. I?ôll go around asking friends for their opinions or I?ôll look online at reviews, videos, etc. and gather intel before making a decision. I do this a lot, like pretty much 24/7. If many people say it?ôs good, then I?ôll try it and see how it works for me. 



9- What are your wishes or goals in life?

I want to be famous, but not super famous, just known a little bit. I want to inspire people and make others think of me in a good light. I want to be talented in many areas; over the summer, I want to maybe start learning Japanese since I already know three languages, English, Spanish, and Jamaican Patois. I do wish to be happy though, but that?ôs kind of unattainable since happiness isn?ôt permanent, but only temporary. 


10- Do you think it's important to live in society?

Idk; it?ôs your life. People can choose what they wanna do. To live, then yeah, but the word society can vary depending on how one chooses to look at the word. 



11- They are spreading false rumors and gossip about you.  How do you feel about it and what would you do?

I?ôd be pissed and wonder why they did it. I probably wouldn?ôt confront them, unless they were my friend. Otherwise, I would just be pissed and wonder what others think of me now. 




12- Would you change/hide your opinion to fit into society?

Depends on the topic; if it?ôs something I care deeply about, then no. I usually kind of express my opinion on how I feel about things regardless, unless I feel self-conscious and I?ôm burdening others or people think I?ôm weird. Then I?ôll just change my opinion so others won?ôt think I?ôm being weird. 



13- Someone is making fun of you publicly.  what would you do in this situation?

If it?ôs my friend, I laugh it off, but might feel a little insecure. If it?ôs someone I don?ôt know, I?ôll probably remain quiet and shrink up and I won?ôt really say or do anything. 



14- What do you think/feel about the future?

I?ôm not sure. I don?ôt really think of it that much; maybe it will be better. Hopefully. The closest I get to thinking about it is what my life will be like and how I?ôll be. 



15- What irritates you?

Depends on the situation ngl. I feel like for many questions, it depends on the situation, so there?ôs no clearcut answer. But things that usually irritate me are throat noises people make when their throat itches, sniffling, excessive nose blowing, things like that. 



16- How do you see yourself?

Sarcastic, insecure, imaginative, naive, shy, loud, outspoken, bold.


17- What would be an ideal world for you?

 A society where we all live in harmony. A society where slavery, racism, colonization never existed. We would all have our original languages and cultures instead of being forced into new ones. There would be no hate, but only love. 



18- Is the object (external facts) or the subject (internal opinions and assumptions) more important to you?

Probably external facts.



19- Do you look for meaning in life internally or externally?

Probably externally, since I look outward for answers about what meaning means.",https://www.personalitycafe.com//threads/enfj-vs-esfj.1375026/,,,,,,,,,,,

Moonshine,Who are ENFJs?  - From an INFP,"Hello everyone,

I am an INFP.  For me, friends are either very close, or they are merely an acquaintance.  My close friends are usually ENFP, INFP, and INFJ.  

There is something I love about NF's.  I have been wondering why I haven't had any close friends who are ENFJ.  

I have two ""potential friends"" at the moment who are ENFJs.  I feel their NF-ness, which makes me want to become closer friends.  But, it is almost as if they don't have this need.  Is this true?  Do ENFJ's not really  need close friends?  They seem to have lots of friends, on a ""medium-level"".  They connect to people easily, and they are not superficial, but they don't seem to go as deep as INFPs...  They stop at a certain level.  Are they happy with this level?

Are ENFJ's very conscious of what behaviour is ""appropriate"", and what is ""inappropriate""?  How important to you is acting appropriately?  I think that the IP vs. EJ difference I feel means that we are different in our impressions of what is ""appropriate""... 

You have Fe first.  I have Fi first.  We both want to please people because we are NF's.  But, this desire is ""different""...  I have no desire to conform.  I take pleasure in being different, thinking outside of the box, and finding my own rules for everything in life.  Whereas ENFJ's are more aware of the box...  They are more aware of what is appropriate.  And they seem to expect me to act inside the box...  Something like that?

And their Ti...  Does your Ti allow you to avoid topics?  Does it allow you to steer conversations into a direction that you feel more comfortable with?  I try to be direct, addressing something ""inappropriately intense"".  And she just steers it to where she feels comfortable...  Something like that.  

I would love to hear what you think of INFPs, and if you can explain the difference between them.  I would be grateful for any insight you have.

I would love to be close friends with an ENFJ because I feel it would help me understand the whole range of NF-ness.  However, maybe they just aren't the ""close friend"" type, at least not according to my definition of ""close friend"".  If they aren't, I am probably better to just give up on this idea, and just let them be the medium-level friend they want to be.",https://www.personalitycafe.com//threads/who-are-enfjs-from-an-infp.148686/,,,,,,,,,,,

Optimus,Being ENFJ and having ADD (ADHD),"Hi all,

Its been awhile since I've been here. I've recently been diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. And it made me think. Could it be quite possible that most ENFJs have ADHD (Samething as ADD just a newer term).

Because here's the thing...

If you have ADHD or you're an ENFJ you probably:

1.) Have trouble listening (but a great listener, but likes to cut to the chase since we have a natural tendency to understand others quickly and on a whim) to others and prefer having to be the speaker (being a mentor and all).

2.) Impulsivity (randomly jumpy, and just random in general)
       -Commit to something and go... oh crap later on.
       -Being hyper as a means to get attention and for the sake of elevating the tone and mood.

3.) Always ""on the go"" or ""being all over the place"" or function as though being run by a ""motor""

4.) Easily distracted.

5.) Sensitive to criticism.

6.) Always being told that you're either weird or just really out there.

I just thought there might be some kind of correlation.",https://www.personalitycafe.com//threads/being-enfj-and-having-add-adhd.29115/,,,,,,,,,,,

Dafnie Nacius,I'm an ENFJ... but I'm an ACCOUNTING Major?,"AND I QUOTE:

""This longing for the perfect carries over into the careers of ENFJ's, who experience some degree of restlessness whatever their jobs. And, as with ENFP's, ENFJ's have a wide range of occupations which offer success. Being verbally adept, ENFJ's contribute to an unusual level dealing with people, particularly face to face; the media, the ministry, and stage and screen are populated successful ENFJ's. They make superior therapists, charismatic teachers, excellent executives, personalized salespersons. Areas that would not permit utilization of the intereactional talents of the ENFJ's, for example, accounting, should be avoided, otherwise, almost any people to people occupation where personal, sustained contact is involved capitalizes on the personality of the ENFJ.""

I'm currently an accounting major and I love my major but I've been having a weird 'gut' feeling about it. Accountants are typically very technical, to themselves and not really into interacting with people. Of course, in this day and age things are changing and accountants need great managing skills to succeed way beyond the norm. I've met lots of accountants, auditors, tax accountants who are not like your typical 'stay in the background and crunch numbers types'. 

Even though the field is changing, I still feel like I'm missing something in my major. I absolutely love people. I want to help people and make a difference in this world. The thought of being stuck behind a cubicle preparing tax statements for a corporation or in a room with an audit team checking through invoices made me go nuts!! I've been searching through these personality tests and careers to see how can I still follow my dream of using my talents in accounting to help people and finally concluded that I should look into becoming a Financial Advisor or Director of some sort of Financial Literacy Program. I want to help people plan and figure out how they can save money, manage their finances and maybe even do their taxes here and there. I wouldn't mind being a CPA where I can work on statements and taxes but I also want to advise. I even found some jobs with the Department of Treasury that were centered around spreading financial literacy and I was like - ding ding ding!! Score!! My accounting college focuses more on preparing students to work for large accounting firms so I had to dig deep for this kind of information.

If there is another ENFJ out there who's interested in a field that doesn't typically fit with their personality type - continue to do research. There is a career path out there for you. You can mix-and-match your talents with your career goals and make it work for you. It might involve you completely changing your major or it might involve you taking a path that's different from your colleagues (like me!). Most of my friends are going into Public Accounting - which is great... but not really what I want to do.

Another note - I am heavily involved in my church. I LOVE ministry. I LOVE performing and acting and music. I am a singer, guitarist, clarinet player and actress. You can imagine how aggravated I was when I had to slow down on my involvement in my choir when my accounting classes became to difficult to handle lol. I also love leading people. Most accountants prefer being behind the scenes. People like me who become accountants move on past their staff accountant levels to pick up roles as Controllers of companies etc etc. I don't mind working in the corporate world too much, but I would prefer to use my talents with a ministry or non-profit organization. It could even be a for-profit company as long as they have a mission of some sort to help individuals. Heck, I wouldn't even mind starting up my own thing! I have an entrepreneurial spirit too.

Tihomir,"I am an INFP and my Enfj Girlfriend broke up with me without telling me the reason, can anybody help me with what should I do.","My enfj girlfriend of 3 years broke up with me this past week and she never told me a direct answer why ( we had a lot of very small problems that don't seem very big ), but we did have a conversation again about those said problems but in a different manner, I think she wanted to break up with me then aswell but when i told her i loved her more the anything and that I am willing to change and I will get on with my schoolwork and get a job ( I am in college and im trying to move into her city where she goes to college aswell and where I will got to college next year and I want to make some extra money). 

2 months later she breaks up with me anyway with again all small problems and never telling me what the issue actualy was. I was sure I was doing everything correct and I as an INFP wanted to apologize as soon as possible thinking that she will close me out forever if I don't do it quickly. I ended up pushing her into a corner and she almost said she wanted to correct things but then out of a sudden changed her mind again 5 minutes later. 

After that conversation 2 days have passed which i have spent going through our entire relationship and examining what the issue was and I realized that she was giving me all this attention and when I was too focused on fixing the issue I had with me not having a job to make some money I neglected her a lot and I realized all the pain I caused to her by doing that. I had some childhood trauma and it was hard for me to show my emotions because of my insecurities and I was getting over them but very slowly thinking it shouldn't be a priority. 

I always showed her a lot of emotion when we were together alone and when we were together every single day, but when college starts then we're away and don't see each other for 5 days. We don't text a lot because we both would rather talk face to face and I felt very bad for not doing that for some time. That's why i was focused on moving there as soon as possible so we could see each other every day. 

I realized she broke up with me because of the neglect because I am a very emotional person and when I talked to my friends about the breakup I told them all of my issues out in the open ( which i always hid ) and I kept telling everyone how much I loved her and that I couldn't live without her and that she is the girl of my dreams. Then yesterday I noticed what an idiot I was... 

I kept telling everyone else what a wonderful person and a great lover my girlfriend is and I never said it enough to herself. I know her to my core and I always knew when she was upset and it always broke my heart but she never showed that she was upset when she would be upset because of me and that's why I never read her correctly then. Now i feel apsolutely miserable and I miss talking to her and telling to her how much I love her. 

I wish i could just make this realization 2 weeks ago. I have so much love for her and all i want to do is tell her every day of how sorry I was and I want to tell her every day how much I love and cherish her and everything she does for me and everyone around her. I know she knows I love her very much and I know she loves me very much. 

I want to show her that i've changed and I want to apologize to her but I know that i backed her up in a corner because of my own stupidity and I am afraid to talk to her again because I don't want her to see me pushing her into something she isn't ready for. But at the same time If i wait too long I am afraid that she will close herself to me and that I will lose her forever. 

I know there is a party coming up where she and I will definetly be there ( we share the same friend circle ) And I want to tell her and show her how much I changed and how much I love her and how I am sorry that i misunderstood her and that she shouldn't doubt herself with anything and that I wish I could tell her I love her and hug her every day. I'm friends with the big party host and I want to surprise her by singing to her infront of everybody with the song from one of her favorite movies 10 things I hate about you ( I am very shy when it comes to my singing and barely sang to her when we were alone ). But that is very risky because i am scared that if I scare her off then then I know my window is closed.",https://www.personalitycafe.com//threads/i-am-an-infp-and-my-enfj-girlfriend-broke-up-with-me-without-telling-me-the-reason-can-anybody-help-me-with-what-should-i-do.1372508/,,,,,,,,,,,
HGy,Living up to the ENFJ cult leader stereotype,"More than once in my life I've lived up to the ENFJ ""cult-leader"" stereotype....   I haven't ever lead an actual cult-- that would be too on-the-nose, but I've had my ""influential"" moments.. 

First one I can recall is when I was about 10 years old... I used to control my brother and the neighbor kids.. I officiated a wedding between an 8 year old and a german shepherd.. its a long story.. 

Next one was in Jr. High (7th grade)... I had this group of friends and in order for them to be my friend they had to eat a disgusting concoction I made which I called a ""smiley pie"". They would eat it and throw up usually, and then they could be my friend. I also made them watch certain movies, 2 movies that had inside jokes that only ,""we"" would get. It was wild because we would kind of initiate people to be in our group of friends and I was the leader of this foolery. 

In college I joined an activity group on campus... some drama went down and I got elected Vice President.. I left and took almost the entire group with me and started my own organization. In hindsight that was an asshole and immature thing to do. Rookie cult leader mistake I guess.

TeamPB,ENFJs and others' logic/opinion and theirs,"Greetings, ENFJ friends. 

I'm talking to you today to ask you a question about what I suspect to be the result of Ti inferior: a lack of ""internal structure"" when it comes to your logic. I used to think I was an ENTP because of some people here but I figured out (with the help of other people) it may not be the case because of a ""bad habit"" I just found out: I tend to not trust myself, my logic, if what I say is ""right"" and as a consequence, I'm prone to looking at others' answers to ""validate"" my thoughts, my logic, as if, for some reason, it was reassuring to see that other people shared your views, your logic. Same with looking at the number of likes a message receives: even though I know it's not enough to truly judge the quality of an argument (anyone can be ""dumb"" or have a bad logic and like the comments of other ""dumb"" people having a bad logic), it's as if such a thing was convincing and enough to give credit to a message...
(even though I don't know if I really bothered to ""check"" this when I was younger...also, another thing: I won't just blindly follow something people say because of the number of ""likes"", I do have my opinions, thanks god, I'm not a literal sheep...but when it comes to subjects ""I don't know"", it may be convincing to me, I have to admit)

So I'm asking you if you could relate to this. Because I saw some posts on the internet:

""Inferior Te is afraid of what others think. ISFPs and INFPs are self-conscious of what others think about them, and worry about their reputation and how others perceive them. Inferior Ti is afraid of what itself thinks. ENFJs and ESFJs experience self-doubt about their own intelligence and whether their thoughts and beliefs are 'right' when it comes to means and method of approaching a task or problem"" 

""So, They?ôre (ENFJs) constantly going to other people asking them, ?úHey, how do you feel about my thought here. I had a thought. How do you feel about it???Because, they want to find that external validation. ENFJs crave recognition and external validation more than anything. Why? Because they?ôre so afraid that they?ôre not actually smart enough so if they get that external validation from elsewhere, they have confidence in their thinking. Even though on the outside, it looks like they?ôre confident in their thinking when deep down they?ôre not actually confident about their thinking. "" 

""They (ENFJs) seek validation by asking what others feel about what the thoughts they present are"" / ""If I'm correct, inferior Ti user has difficulties thinking for himself, lack of introspection, so it relies on others to validate his thoughts?"" => ""That last paragraph almost sounds like Te since the trust seems to come form the external, so idk about that tbh""

Could you please share me your thoughts about that? Do you agree? Can you relate to this? Could this actually just be (very) low Ti? Or is it just something feelers (mostly IxFPs and ExFJs) have in common: ""bad thinking skills"" or at least insecurity when it comes to their (our?) thinking skills?

Kenolo87,A question for ENFJs (female),"Hi,
I have a question for a female ENFJ, a very jovial and outspoken person working at the same building, but different department (university). I am sitting on another floor, but the coffee machine is on her floor, so I usually end up there. As I sometimes work on weekends, I noticed she did too and approached her once in the coffee room. I introduced myself, had some nice small talk, and didn?ôt see her afterward for a long time. After the summer break, I was walking with a colleague and I saw she saw us from far away but kept her stare on the floor and passed without looking up or saying hello. I thought that she is maybe either arrogant or does not remember me, so I forgot about her.  Some week later, at an introductory course at our university for teachers (we both teach), although she was sitting with another group of people, she approached across the room and started talking to me. At the end of the class we walked together to our building, she asked me a lot of questions and she said we should have coffee sometimes. I saw her the next week and helped her around with the homework for the course. After that whenever she sees me across the hall she waves at me, sometimes even with both hands. I wanted to ask her out, but I only see her in work settings and dont want to make her feel uncomfortable. However, this week I met her on the bus and we sat across from each other. It was mostly me asking questions (no private, only job related), she did respond nicely and smiled, however the moment I went silent, she could not look me in the eyes, and started staring through the window, which made me feel uncomfortable considering that she is not a shy person and always seems in control of the situation whenever I see her talking to other people. I know it may sound stupid, but I also notice her always stroking her hair whenever talking to me, which I have not seen her doing with other people. My question is, is the bus situation a  sign that she is feeling uncomfortable around me or is it a good sign? I know through a mutual friend that she is single (she is almost always in office, hard working until late in the nights). Thanks in advance.",https://www.personalitycafe.com//threads/a-question-for-enfjs-female.1372462/,,,,,,,,,,,

Charus,Do you ENFJ's consider this correct or relate?,"The main screaming elephant in the Room I want to address regarding ENFJ's is the whole stereotype of being an Extroverted person.

Generaly Extroverted types described is being very active, energetic, always going to parties and talk a lot.

So, I have typed myself as an ENFJ, because I strongly relate to their unhealthy traits of wanting affirmation, validation and the issue of Inferior Ti, where I feel conflicted whether I should express my opinions or not to not upset others and often I dont feel very trustful of my own thinking because I fear I might come up as wrong, incorrect, misinformed or stupid to others and sometimes I feel insecure about my intelligence.

But I want to address one thing. Being an ENFJ does not mean you always like going outside or going to parties or something like that? Is it true that an ENFJ might enjoy sitting at home and relaxing to have fun?

Because when I was very young, I was surprisingly extroverted, I used to rather easily to make friends and get better with them with full confidence, but that confidence completely diminished out of me when I started to slowly get into toxic groups when appearenly my presence felt very unwelcoming and being singled out, the same thing with my Father whom I live with, where I feel like I need to please him by helping him so he would not view me as useless and not having to deal with constant criticism being thrown my way.

I used to be mistyped as an IxFP or IxTJ most of the time because I thought I was a full blown introvert, but I digress with this, my mind always tells me that I am an extroverted person. I want to have friends and people to be with and to form connection with others and feel being an important part of the group, but my confidence was completely diminished and I become an awkward person with ""introverted"" self-isolating tendencies who is constantly shying away from the situation.",https://www.personalitycafe.com//threads/do-you-enfjs-consider-this-correct-or-relate.1361789/,,,,,,,,,,,
IamAlexa,Beauty and Pain of Loneliness,"(Essay in the form of a poem)

Its about the pain of every extremely (I said ""extremely"" not ""just more than average"") level of beauty. Its about a girl in my neighborhood. Her life is funny that's why I am writing about it here. Its a mixture of funny and painful. But she still wants to laugh about it.

?å∏?å∏?å∏?å∏?å∏?å∏?å∏?å∏?å∏?å∏?å∏?å∏?å∏?å∏?å∏?å∏?å∏


Being the center of attention of all boys, and then being hated by all girls for no reason,

A proud moment to be beautiful without makeover,
At the same time a constant feeling of inferiority of not having a friendship,

Nobody sees the pain,
Everybody sees the beauty,
Tell anyone that she is depressed,
And they will say that she has no reason to be depressed- she is so beautiful,

The childhood habit of being the center of attention ""everybody's gonna look at me"" obvious vibe embedded in the identity,
Is unable to erase the immense pain the girls bring to her life,

Having no girlfriends,
And no genuine boy as friend,
She is forever occupied and protected by boys,
At the same time escaping from them,

What does she want,
She doesn't know,

Having been tried to convince girls in every way possible,
She isn't able to convince them to be her friend,

And when after a lot of struggle even if she does that,
There's no guarantee that she will get them,
Losing her girlfriends one by one all because she is too attractive even when she doesn't intend to harm anyone,

Been called rude,
Just because she is the center of attention,
Been called wierd,
Just because she attracted the same boy that the other person liked,
Been neglected by girls for no reason,

And she keeps on blaming herself

Still she is stronger than all of them,
Beating all of them,
Smiling all the time,
Helping everyone,
Been introverted because she can't tackle the environment's stress,
Been a public speaker,
Because she loves the attention

Been everything she wants,
Except a suitable girl for a normal friendship....

CoopV,How to get over an ENFJ,"I met an ENFJ about a month (I?ôm an INFJ) and a half ago on a friend app (BumbleBFF) and he had just gotten out of a relationship a month before.

We first went out to a museum and I was surprised by how much chemistry we had. Laughter, talking about the history behind artwork, bouncing ideas off each other, getting to know each other. Well after that meeting he said he wanted to see me again the next week.

So the next week he invited me to his place to watch his favorite show and then go out to get dessert at a French restaurant. He compliments my outfit and makes playful jokes and he keeps staring deeply into my eyes with a big smile. At one point I had to ask ?úWhat????Cuz he just kept squinting and staring at me with a big smile. That night he asks all about my family and asks deep questions and tries to make me laugh. Then he offered to help me put together some furniture the next week.

Fast forward to the next week and he comes over and puts together 4 pieces of furniture I needed help with no questions asked. He keeps looking at me smitten and at one point I ran my fingers up his arm when he told me a story about his scar.

Then the next week we get together again for a stroll, grab dessert, and walk along a bayside walkway at night. It felt romantic. He keeps trying to make me laugh, I poke him at one point and he pokes me back and we talk about how romantic the rowboats are in a pond nearby. We go back to his place to watch Netflix but I had to leave early and he didn?ôt want me to go. We give each other a much longer hug/embrace this time and he says let me know when you get home safe. And then quickly says ?úI mean so I know you didn?ôt get murdered or anything.??And he says he wants to see me again soon.

So the last meeting he says why dont we cook a meal at his place. The two of us are in his kitchen close together, at one point I poke him and he pokes me, and he keeps trying to make me laugh. We go to grill on his rooftop and he ends up sharing some personal things about his upbringing and cries so I hug/hold him. We talked more about our families and upbringing. After we finish eating we go to watch a movie and I ask the question ?úCan I ask you something? Are just??Friends???And he brusquely says ?úYes.??So I so okay??That night I leave a little early and of course felt VERY disappointed/hurt.

So I text him ?úThanks for grilling, I think I?ôm getting feelings for you but I know you just want to be friends so I think I need a little break from hanging out right now.??And he replies ?úI understand. I?ôm sorry if I hurt you in any way.??
So my question is what is up with his behavior? Did he actually like me? I?ôve never seen this type of behavior with a platonic friend.

And also, how can I forget about him completely? Because I?ôm a bit emotionally devastated.",https://www.personalitycafe.com//threads/how-to-get-over-an-enfj.1371488/,,,,,,,,,,,
RiseFromTheAshes,I (INFP) have a crush on my manager who is ENFJ,"I have been a lurker on this forum for a while, but finally created an account to be more active here.

For clarification, I'm 30-year old INFP male, and my manager is a 37 year old ENFJ female (lets call her Emma).

I have a crush on my manager (Emma), and I realise that this is a completely no-go territory, so just need to vent out a bit. My manager is 7 years older than me too and with 2 children (but separated from her ex-husband).

I work at a corporate job (honestly an incredible place to work) with around 4,000 employees. I have been working here for 3 years. The first year and a half, I had a different manager who was also great, but it definitely felt strictly professional. Emma was my boss's boss, but since my boss left, she became my direct boss. I only got into MBTI and enneagram at the start of this year and delved into it obsessively. I wish I had discovered this sooner to be honest, as I could then have understood why I felt like I didn't belong anywhere during all those years.

Emma was very flirty initially, and I don't know how to react when being flirted or complimented so tend to feel really uncomfortable and blush. I wish I was suave haha. We would be on a Zoom call, and I usually have my webcam turned off as I dislike putting it on in group chats. Once, I felt in the mood to turn the webcam on in our weekly team chats (of about 10 people), and Emma was like ""Why do you always have your webcam turned off? You are the cutest."" Then, there was awkward silence among the rest of us as I didn't know what to say and got too in my head, and she filled the silence with ""I mean, the rest of you are cute too."". It's scary and annoying that I can still remember most conversations with anyone...

Last month, I had a photography exhibition at a cafe (this is what I'm really passionate about, I rely on my work income to fuel this), and Emma organised a lunch and invited a lot of staff to come see my work. This was when I started to absolutely adore her. Her birthday was on that day too, so I suggested a gift which we our team chipped in to give her. This was my favourite day of the year when a lot of people from work came in to see my exhibition and my manager was just happy for me, plus it helped make it a memorable birthday for her.

Last week was my birthday, and Emma had organised an incredible day for it (hands down best birthday in my life ever), she organised a team coffee, followed by a team lunch and bought me lunch, plus gave me a gift card at my favourite shop, and a book that she thought that I might like (as I'm an avid reader). And she made everyone sing happy birthday (which I usually dislike as it makes me uncomfortable), and Emma was having a laugh about it as she knows I hate attention. As I was opening the presents, she was really observant about my reaction towards it. Although, for me, just the fact that she put in the thought to find a book that I might have liked was enough for me to already appreciate the present (the book was awesome and I'm reading it now). It's called ""The Lost Pianos of Siberia"".

Yesterday, we were supposed to have a one-on-one catch up and Emma suggested we go out and get coffee instead and I agreed. She picked a table that was quite intimate, literally the whole place was empty, and was like ""Ooh, this is like a date"". I acted oblivious and was playing with the flimsy chair. Honestly, I don't even know how to respond to that. If she wasn't my boss, then I could have been more playful. Soon, this coffee catch-up followed with a lunch, and we ended up talking for over an hour. But it was about everything BUT work. She was asking me questions that were soulful and, to be honest, that actually felt like a very fantastic date.

In the past 4 months, I dated an ENFP, but this was short-lived as she decided to follow something that interested her in a different city. However, she was nowhere near as caring as Emma. The ENFP and I were very go-with-the-flow kind of people. Ending things with the ENFP only put me down for a few days (as she messaged me about her decision, instead of telling me in person). When hearing the ENFP talk, it struck me that that was how people close to me hear me as. She was also an artist, but stopped her interest and became a teacher, and when I told her about my exhibition, she did not even react to it. Honestly, I realised that I need someone like Emma in my life, who would make my birthday feel special and be proud and supportive of my creative works. I just wish that she wasn't my boss lmao.

Two of my best friends (both male) are ENFJs too. One from high school and the other as an adult. The luck that the first ENFJ female I meet turns out to be my boss haha. But at least I should be grateful for having a great job that I look forward to because of the best boss ever. I'm able to pursue my interests AND have a great time in the office as well. Honestly, the day that she moves to a different role is going to suck for me, I might have to move to a different country.

If you read through all of this, you are an absolute legend, thank you. Would love to hear your thoughts about this.",https://www.personalitycafe.com//threads/i-infp-have-a-crush-on-my-manager-who-is-enfj.1371511/,,,,,,,,,,,

bananacake,how to know if an enfj likes you as a friend or romantically?,"A few months ago I met an ENFJ guy via a mutual friend. We all play in the same basketball team once a week. From the beginning I noticed that he was very nice and flirty towards me. One night we hooked up at a party that we both attended. That evening he asked me a bunch of random questions and would not leave my side. The same night he ended up inviting me to a dinner that he hosted for some friends the day after. That day after he told me out of nowhere that he was ""currently not interested in a relationship with me."" I was surprised why he felt the urge to tell me but replied that I also wasn't looking for anything serious. 

Since then he has been inviting me to join him on other activities with his friends like board game evenings, cooking, parties, other sports (where our mutual friend was not invited). I noticed him sometimes innocently touching me. There was another party that we attended together, where we ended up hooking up very intensely. When we left, a friend of mine asked us why I wasn?ôt taking him home to which I just replied ""no"". (not that I didn't want to but I already had plans for the next morning). So we still haven't slept together. 

Its been four months now and we see each other multiple times a week doing the same hobbies. He regularly initiates and plans those and other activities, sometimes its just us the two of us, other times he also invites friends. Last time he wanted to go out with me, but I wasn't feeling well and declined. So he changed the plan to us going out for dinner. At dinner he asked how my date was, because both of us went on dates with other people the day before. And then he generally talked about relationships. We found that we share the same views. He said that from his experience around every 3 years he meets sb that he can actually picture a relationship with, the last time was exactly 3 years ago. I also mentioned that I was gonna do another multi day hike this summer. (He knows that I love hiking, and I know that he hates it). But he basically invited himself to join, even scheduled the exact days and said that he also has another friend who may come along. He insisted on paying for dinner, walked me to my station and waited with me until my bus came. 

So now I am confused. Sometimes I get signals that he definitely likes me more than a friend but maybe he acts like this towards anyone? After all he did clarify in the beginning that he was not interested in a relationship with me.",https://www.personalitycafe.com//threads/how-to-know-if-an-enfj-likes-you-as-a-friend-or-romantically.1369983/,,,,,,,,,,,

Respect,ENFJ vs ENTJ vs ESFJ vs ESTJ - Differences vs Similarities Group Interview,"Hello ENFJs! In this interview, I got a chance to talk to all the ExxJ types about their shared experiences and what makes them different from one another. During the interview, we talked about ExxJs having trouble making a decision for themselves and needing permission from the tribe before making decisions. We also talked about Te shaming Ti and Fe shaming Fi. Savannah asked an awesome question to the ESFJ and ENFJs on how Te's can be more sensitive to Ti's and not offend them. We also discussed what their Ti or Fi swing looks like when they go on a ""selfishness"" swing. We also discussed racist jokes and how they perceived it as an ExxJ. We also talked about blood and family ties and how the ESFJ and ENFJ perceived it differently from the ENTJ and ESTJ. Double observing was something we tried discussing but the topic was too boring for the ExxJs to continue talking about because it's so easy for them. In the end, the ExxJs had a message to say to fellow ExxJs on how to better themselves as individuals. Some things I noticed about each participant include Julia (ESFJ and our only info-dominant ExxJ) did an amazing job maintaining the flow of the conversation being balanced with her Si+Fe and Ne+Ti. Maggie (our jumper ESFJ) was relatively quiet and focused on gathering the tribe's perspective. Rob (our jumper ENFJ with double activated Ti and token male ExxJ) was acting very ExxP like with committing to decisions. Savannah (our jumper ENTJ) asked some very good questions to the lead Fe's. Nina (our jumper ESTJ and only lead NT) was doing a makeshift double decider which shows how present that masculine Fi is at the bottom when double activated. Natalie (our ENFJ and only MF) produced many hilarious moments including before the interview with her blast to Nina just seconds after learning something from Julia. And finally, Heather shows the big difference between an ESTJ and ENTJ when it comes to dealing with presenting themselves to the tribe. I also thought it was interesting that Julia being info-dominant was not as scared of how the tribe perceived her as the energy dominants were. Julia said she can clarify with the tribe which shows the easy flow of information while Natalie said she never thought of asking the tribe and just assumed everyone hated her.

gstephanie,(Need Advice) ENFJ Guy & ENFP Girl,"Hi I'm an ENFP girl and I just met this ENFJ guy through online app.
He's currently on vacation in my city and expected to go back this weekend.

We had 2 dates so far.
First one lasted for full 2 hours chat over a coffee. We really connect in most of our hobbies and preferences, he even said ""I feel like I've known you for a long time"".
Then when we're about to say goodbye he suddenly leaned and kissed me - 3 quick kisses.

The day after we decided to go to the museum, we spent 6 hours together, this time with lots of physical touch (he initiated them), lots of kisses on lips and sometimes he just kisses my forehead few times.
We already talked so much about heavy things: socio-political issues, traveling stories, future goals, religion things. Though we have major differences we could understand each other.
Then we talked if this relationship could go to a more serious way, he said he never did long distance relationship before but he'd like have a movie date (netflix party haha) or video call when he's back home, and see where it goes from there.
He said ""not sure where this goes but at least we can be friends and I'm happy to have met you"".

I once boldly ask if i was just his fling, and he's kinda shocked and said ""I'd never see you as a fling"".

From all his physical touch I would think that he's into it, because of the forehead kisses. But reading that sentence above makes me think he is kinda pessimistic and already made up his mind to be friends.

Could anybody share what do you think on this?

Kasani,Typical response to long-term isolation,"Hi there,
Quick question to any ENFJs out there that have more knowledge about the subject that I do. How do you think you would respond to an extended period of isolation? Hypothetically lets say 3 years of isolation resulting from almost everyone, including your family, shunning you, for reasons out of your control and not your fault. There would still be people around you, but they'd all be holding you at arm's distance, interacting with you as little as they could possibly manage or just plain ignoring your existence. 

I really hope no one can answer that from personal experience because that would be awful to go through. >_> General speculation is fine. The situation arises in a book I'm writing with an ENFJ MC who has this experience in her mid to late teens. I'm having trouble imagining how that might effect her personality and relationships later in life.

BensUsername,Do ENFJ's tend to have an extremely random sense of humor?,"My closest friend has been typed as an ENFJ, and he's literally the most random human being I've ever encountered in my entire life, his sense of humor is wacky and bizarre. It usually involves strange mental imagery involving people that him and I both know, 'Imagine X(person) doing Y(strange thing)'. 

It comes pretty natural to him to, he's told me that he's almost constantly imagining things about people, he's said to me 'I'll be reading a book or something and then like 3 seconds later my mind will drift off and I'll imagine someone dancing or something'. :tongue:

He's also the type who will abruptly start making random noises and talking in almost 'cartoonish' voices.

Is this typical ENFJ humor? Because without knowing any better I'd say this is 'Ne humor', but I don't really know how Fe+Ni is, and from what I've read from ENFJ's he fits their general behavior to a T.

Respect,ENFJ Female Natalie Fe-Ni BP/S(C) MF Interviewed by ENFP Male,"Hello ENFJs! In this interview, I got a chance to talk to Natalie about what it's like to be an ENFJ Fe-Ni BP/S(C) MF. First, Natalie talked about her feminine Fe and double feminine NF blast. She described how it's different from an ESFJs blast. We also talked about the ENFJs fear of getting kicked out from the tribe if they don't help people. She said that they feel like if they get kicked out, they wouldn't know what to do with themselves to make them happy because of the Ti at the bottom. I also asked her what she thought her identity is with the NT sleep and she said that as an ENFJ, she gets her identity from being the wise guru who can solve all problems and have all answers. We also talked about SF play and how it can be both really stupid but also really useful. Natalie said that she is envious of ST play because they can explain work much better than SF play who just wants to party and play all day. During the interview, Natalie demonstrated her masculine Se as she chucked one of her cushions at her cat. Natalie also talked about how with her Se, she's always looking for the best. Best food, best clothes, best whatever. Natalie also talked about her masculine Ti and how she perceives herself as a threat, especially if she drops her M-Ti bomb on someone. I also asked Natalie why it's uncomfortable to ask people for directions or help. She told me that it's really irrational because she knows if someone asks her for help, she'd love to help that person and won't feel judgemental about it. Natalie said that as a decider, she feels like you should be more prepared with the double observing that you never need to ask for help from someone; otherwise, you come across as stupid.

LuxEterna,Male ENFJs are commitment phobic,"I have dated an ENFJ male for 4 mths. He's really sweet, but he seems to be absent minded at times, like he has been possessed by his job. He is always ""busy/stressed"" and has no time for me (i only need to see him once a week. that's not a lot, right?)

Then he told me, ""I have no time for you. I am very busy. I can only see you once in 2 weeks.""

So I said in firm gentle and compassionate way, ""Ok, let's take a braek from each other. BTW, i do know of your going out with other girls from the dating website.""

Then for some reason, he opened up to me about his struggles with work and struggles to quit his addiction to going out with girls etc. It was such intimate sharing that I feel like we are even emotionally closer than before. His body language was very relaxed, affectionate and he held my hand very tightly and I felt very cherished. 

The next day, he told me, ""I'm sorry that I hurt you.""

The next time we met, we were supposed to be ""friends"" now and I felt like we are still having strong feelings for each other. Our behavior subtly shows that. He puts a hand protectively on my shoulder or on my knee despite that we were with my friends. He is very accomodating and gentlemanly. 

I'm wondering if he is commitment phobic and actually manipulated me to ""breakup"" or ""take a break"" from him.

i read that ENFJ's push people away even though they care for these people. Is this what he is doing? I dont understand his behavior. I feel he's sending me mixed signals.",https://www.personalitycafe.com//threads/male-enfjs-are-commitment-phobic.55593/,,,,,,,,,,,
jsummers12981,How do I stop my ENFJ self from feeling so down when my life is in a good place?,"Hello fellow ENFJs 

I've been single since November and although I would never go back with my ESTP ex and I am in a very good place, I can't help but feel a massive gaping hole in my heart. 
I have my life well together for a 25 year old, I have a stable career, a few networks of friends, a loving albeit small family, a lovely flat in a nice area, tons of hobbies and things that could keep my busy - however without a relationship I feel like my life is stagnating. Nothing makes me happier than creating a deep bond with a SO, and building a normal happy life with someone - I finally thought I found that in my last relationship (although in hindsight I realised I gave way more than I received and would never go back to that...and the cheating). 

My friends tell me well ""some of my best years have been when I was single"" and although that may be true for them I just can't help but get in this weird depressive state where I feel like I can't be bothered to get out of bed or tidy up on some days unless I have an obligation to someone, however when I'm in a relationship I put in 110% in each day, I just want to give so badly, I just feel so empty when I'm not, things become somewhat meaningless to me. 

Currently I have a ISTJ that is keen on me and met me for a few dates via a friend, I decided we're best as friends now because there is obviously some cognitive differences (he comes across as robotic and rigid - however I very much admire his dutifulness and loyalty) and he has 0 interests outside of work so there's very little to talk about and I feel drained sometimes, conversations are very surface level. Saying that my parents are ENFJ + ISTJ and they have the best marriage I've ever known by becoming duals. 
Myself and a fellow ENFJ friend have recently become extremely close and slept together on a few occassions, we decided one day to start dating each other back in January but the next day he got cold feet as he himself had just come out of never ending relationships for the last 5 years and wanted some time alone and didn't want to ruin our friendship which is understandable. Myself and this ENFJ do get along so very well, we truly understand eachother, have same core values, humour, an exciting mix of spontanousness and dutifiulness that is hard to come by. 

Maybe I am still feeling the aftershock from the rollercoaster of my ex and the possibility of me and my ENFJ friend getting together which would be a match made in heaven, just the timing is wrong. I just feel so down and it's on my mind 24/7 for 4 months now, I just can't get any joy out of my hobbies or interests at the moment and I lose concentration at work so badly which I didn't before. I can't really date because I live in such an isolated area it's so hard to meet anyone.
I feel selfish for how horrible I feel about myself, many people are in way worse positions than me in their life (my neighbour is about to become homeless for example!) and they just get on with it and here I am getting depressed I don't have a partner ?? but really I just want to be on that path of building something with someone and I feel so stagnant without working on that as I have every other part of my life complete. Currently on the outside no one would know that I'm anything but a confident, warm and adventurous person who is living their best life but inside I feel so lost and empty and without purpose.  

Any other ENFJ perspectives on the situation would be so helpful - thank you all!!???•∞",https://www.personalitycafe.com//threads/how-do-i-stop-my-enfj-self-from-feeling-so-down-when-my-life-is-in-a-good-place.1365808/,,,,,,,,,,,

krillmachine,"Breakdown, Trauma, Letting Go....","Hi,

Earlier this year I had somewhat of a breakdown, it was like a perfect combination of things all piled up and the house of cards came crashing down...the past, present and future all completely overwhelming me....when I feel like this I seem to get really stuck on everything that has ever hurt or upset me and I can be extremely cruel to myself, almost torturing myself...the way in which I can treat myself at times is not at all the way in which I would treat others...this is something I am really trying to work on; to be kind to myself.

One thing that has come up following this breakdown and trying to improve myself is the amount of trauma in my past and to some extent I had hidden a lot of my past from myself...not allowing myself to really experience feeling hurt and instead pushing everything deep down or creating a pleasant world inside my head to shield myself from reality (writing this makes me feel insane).

Is trauma, having trouble accepting/letting go of things and experiencing emotional problems intrinsic to ENFJ types?

I'm finding all of this really difficult and almost paralyzed by my emotions.

Wendy,Self-esteem issues and close friendships (the ENFJ),"Hello fellow ENFJs 

I've been taking a closer look at my inner-self and I'm realizing that a ton of my issues stem from low self-esteem. If I think about it there is no reason for me to not be confident in myself but its my natural tendency. Example: if a friend makes a skeptical face after I say something it affects me WAY more than it should. I'm wondering if it is common for ENFJs to suffer from low self-esteem, how other ENFJs have dealt with it, and if it has gotten better with age. 

Another quirk about me: I don't form extremely close relationships often. Over the course of my life I have had one ""best"" friend. (Best friend meaning someone I show my whole self to, someone I am completely comfortable with.) I think this might relate to me not being confident enough in myself to let people in. This is not to say I don't have any friends. I have tons of friends, and really good ones that trust me a lot; I just don't give my whole self to them. My second question: is this normal for ENFJs?

takkenne,ENFJ Coping with Vulnerability,"I was talking to another ENFJ, and I was shocked to see how we both handle emotional pain and vulnerability. Both of us are very willing to talk about emotional pain and about times when we were weak or felt weak, but only after it happens and we feel fine again. In the moment, however, we both feel the need to hide our emotions, even from that small circle of people we love and trust.

For instance: I just got dumped by a guy. It really hurt. I have a lot of close friends I tell everything, but because I felt so ashamed (that I was dumped, that I missed him, that I was hurting and he wasn't, that I didn't see it coming), I didn't tell anyone pretty much anything and isolated myself until I felt better again. In general, I think I have a deep fear of being vulnerable (which affected the relationship with the guy in question). I won't ask for help when I really need it because I'm scared the fact that I need something from someone else will reveal something about me. Reveal what? I don't know.

I'm sure this goes far beyond MBTI and applies to all types to a certain extent, but I was also wondering if the nature of Fe might play into it a little. We're so used to masking our emotions and playing a role that it can be scary to be our genuine selves, even with people we love and trust the most. I know an INFP like this as well, except she never opens up haha. I at least talk about it once the emotions have passed.

Serpents et echelles,Am I the exception to the the INFP-ENFJ attraction rule?,"I've had what I consider to be a weird interaction with an enfj and I'm looking for some insight or advice. I am an infp and from what I have been reading enfjs and infps are at best natural partners and soulmates and if nothing else generally get on very well and make for a great friendship.

I met this enfj socially and I felt a pull to him immediately, but couldn't figure out why and brushed it off as nothing. Eventually, we ended up having a one-on-one conversation and I can't describe the overwhelming spark that I felt in a pretty banal conversation. I had never and still to this day have never felt that with anyone in my life and I was overwhelmed and shocked by it. It was so strong that I actually had to look away and break the conversation because I felt that he could feel my energy or read how I felt (as ridiculous as that sounds), it was that powerful, for me anyway. 

Although I never went out of my way to talk to him or interact with him because he was in a relationship and I knew my feelings, we were part of an activity for several weeks it meant that we did have to come in contact. Even when we were not speaking to each other, but I ended up standing next to him or he sat next to me I felt this magnetic pull to him like I never experienced before in life. 

Anyway, I soon noticed that his interactions with me did not mirror his interactions with other people. When talking to everyone else he was his typical friendly, outgoing, charming enfj self and he would make it a point to be incredibly friendly with everyone and ask them questions about themselves and really get to know people, but when it came to me he was silent and awkward and never wanted to really engage in conversation with me. 

Even in a group setting if I would try to talk to him he seemed to be putting up some sort of barrier and when he would talk to me he wasn't as friendly or outgoing as he was with other people. Sometimes he even seemed cold or detached. The few times we would exchange messages I would be my normal infp funny self and he would barely respond and not really give anything. However, he would text up a storm with everyone else and became friends with them.

I guess my question is why? If infps and enfjs are supposed to be either this great love match or great friendship why was he at every imaginable turn blocking any kind of interaction we had or could have had? No, I was not expecting for us to fall in love and run away together as he had a girlfriend, but it is odd that we couldn't even be friends. 

When we would message and I would ask him questions about himself he would not give any insight about his life. At times he felt like he wanted to keep me at arm's length or did not like me at all. Is there something that I as an infp might have done to upset him that I didn't realize or is this just one of those situations where this particular enfj did not care for this particular infp? 

I remember this one time we were sitting next to each other and he got up to go do something and when he was finished instead of returning to his seat next to me he went and sat all the way on the other side of the room. It was things like that he would do that would leave me so confused. 

In group situations where I would watch him work the room and talk to everyone and get to know everyone it felt like he intentionally did not in any way want to engage me at all. Is that something enfjs do when someone has upset them? Do they go out of their way to exclude them? I guess I'm just trying to figure out what happened.",https://www.personalitycafe.com//threads/am-i-the-exception-to-the-the-infp-enfj-attraction-rule.1329459/,,,,,,,,,,,

My sister and I had friends over, and my mother in front of everyone gave me shampoo, conditioner, detangler, leave in conditioner, and styling creme that was designed to make hair go from curly to straight.

I've become very obsessive about the way I look, but I don't have a negative self image. I carry myself rather highly, and dress and act accordingly usually. Regardless of this, I think my intellectually depressive attitude might turn women off. I like to talk about totally complex things and it seems that no women find that attractive. Over the years this has caused me to constantly wonder what people saw when they looked at me. I use to think that my ability to intellectually communicate would be a chick magnet but now I know better. I don't necessarily view it as a problem with me, though. In fact, I find myself attempting to ""dumb myself down"" to meet the standards of the women I'm attracted to. Furthermore, it seems that every time I give a women respect they immediately shut me out. It's like they don't want to be with me unless they constantly have to pursue my respect. As soon as I give a women any respect (which I usually believe they deserve) I'm fucked. Plus anytime I start to talk about my true beliefs or try to get into a deep convo with a woman they look at me like I'm an alien.

Emancipation,Why EXFJs mistype,"I've arrived at the conclusion that I am an ENFJ after a long ass time, and the reason I struggled to realize this is because I was emulating other types in hopes that other people will like me more. In functional terms, my dominant Fe was compelling me to present as other types because I thought that's what people wanted me to be.

I remember certain scenarios in which people thought that my enthusiasm and empathy was inauthentic, like:
a) my high school friend telling me that it's weird how hard I laugh at all of her jokes
b) an acquaintance telling me my shocked gasp when I heard somebody she knew died was fake
c) my sister telling me that it doesn't matter that I say she's beautiful, because I always tell her that anyway.

Because of that, I learned how to be more argumentative and strongly disagree with people... sort of like a strong Fi user who prides himself on his individuality and doesn't care what others think. For example, when I don't like l how someone's outfit looks I tell them outright, not because I'm not aware of how it will hurt them, but because they will know that I'm being 100% real when I compliment them next time. 

That way, if they say my compliments are fake, I can reiterate by saying ""Nuh-uh. You know damn well I'll call you out if I think you're doing something wrong. Remember X situation?"" I became a strong-headed, brutally honest individual who doesn't need affirmation from anyone else. I learned how to be rude... so that they could take my kindness more seriously. 

I learned to tone down my Extroverted Feeling because of the negative associations that come with it (fake laughing, being overly friendly, looking weak by changing myself for other people)... which was an Extroverted Feeling motivation in and of itself.

There are many, many other examples of me imitating characteristics of other types, but I don't want to write 5 more paragraphs. I'm so sorry if this is confusing.

Nobleheart,Famous ENFJ Fictional Characters,"Here's a thread to post examples of fictional characters that you feel have been written to closely resemble the ENFJ archetype.

ihavenopersonality,Examples of ENFJ character's,"Please add if you know any examples. I'll start with not quite ENFJ's.

When I was a kid, I loved the the 90's X-Men cartoon and it had a great example of an ENFJ Charles Xavier. Now, most see him as an INFJ which is probably true because he definitely doesn't give off that high energy of ENFJ's but the only problem is, no INFJ would actually take that kind of relentless initiative for their cause unless they've been put into the position already without any personal effort needing to be carried out. They just do it in their heads and if it comes up naturally and it doesn't take too much extraneous effort, they'll fight for what they believe in. ENFJ's on the other hand force what they know is good upon others and this is a good thing cos its force through kindness and empathy.

But then I guess you can say ""what about Martin Luther King or Hitler"" I make it sound like INFJ's are lazy but its not the case, they just have a different mode of being. But to really critique an INFJ properly, you just have to mirror them to INFP's. INFP's despite being introverted have unlimited will and energy and summoning knowingness from other dimensions and WANTING to integrate and manifest those things in actuality. The stereotype that INFP's are lazy comes from the very real phenomena of INFP's being overwhelmed by a flawed Te set up of society that makes them feel impossible for them to achieve and actualise or even be able to survive the world they are in. Then overthinking comes through the Se in the world which stimulates their Se and just constantly thinking about Se to the point it becomes debilitating. INFJ's choose to be lazy. Se is an immediate function, so to affect it takes no effort yet INFJ's still don't bother trying while Te takes generations to change in society because Te is codified law and mode of being in society.

Picard from ST next gen is also seen as an INTJ but I see his character as an amalgamation of INTJ and ENFJ. When he's being unhealthy and unlikeable, he's written as an INTJ, but in flow, the Te starts to sound like Fe. In the new show, he is fully an xNFJ. But its a terrible show.",https://www.personalitycafe.com//threads/examples-of-enfj-characters.1349672/,,,,,,,,,,,

Cristina 19,How bad can criticism affect ENFJ?,"When I was younger I used to be extroverted. I will play with the other kids every day. 
I was the type that really liked to be praised so I did well in school and I was good at sports too. I was competitive with the boys too. With the other kids I will take the lead constantly and they seemed to like me. Sometimes with the adults I will be shy but I really wanted to impress everyone. But I wasn't the kind of mean girl from school, more like a girl who tries to be good at everything, doing my best. 

I was naive to think that people will like me for being like this. At some point (7th grade) they started talking bad about me, talk about my flaws, how I look. Said that I don't deserve my grades (their parents). It was a shock for me at that time. And this happened a lot from then on. In the begining I continued to be the same so I will get on their nerves but at some point I just didn't want the attention anymore. 

Because it always came with criticism and people pointing my flaws. 

When I was in kindergarden I will be so confident saying a poetry on mother's day at school and now at 23 yo I can't make a presentation. I just start talking, I see the people looking at me and all I can think about is:

They don't like me. If I do good they will talk bad about me. They are looking for every flaw they can find. 

And I lose my focus. 

On the inside I'm the same, at home I'm the same but with other people I will be quiet. I don't want people to say bad things about me. Most people will hate you for being better at something, will be jealous and I feel it and I don't like it.

SilentScream,ENFJ - The lukewarm and calculating empath !,"Keirsey NF = 1 of 4 Empathic idealists with a huge concern for humanity's condition and bigger picture 
JCF Fe>Ni = Socially conforming empathic idealist  
MBTI ENFJ = Empathic Idealist [pedagogue of humanity] prone to being manipulated and being manipulative

No matter where I look, where I turn, the most common thing constantly spoken about ENFJ's is our idealistic / empathic natures. 

However, and here's the great divide in my opinion as far as the descriptions are concerned and the real experiences shared by people. 

Assuming that everyone has their ENFJ's typed right, no matter who posts in the forum, the 2 most common things they have to say about their ENFJ(s) are that ENFJ's are empathic and caring, or just as manipulative and controlling.  

Now ... one thing is pretty much clear, that regardless of how manipulative the ENFJ is - empathy, empathy and more empathy !!

However, considering the other side of the coin, I can't help but wonder just how ideally idealistic ENFJ's really are. What goes on in the mind of the ENFJ is a mystery that even I can't unlock ... 

What goes on in the mind of an ENFJ is a constant stream of thought about other people, humanity, the world - deep connections, immediate solutions to vast social problems - an optimistic hope that things will turn out for the better. But at the same time, this positive stream of thought is constantly countered by another which goes ""What has the world done for me anyways?"" and ""Will what I do really make a difference?""

I wonder if this is a question that's mainly faced by the younger idealist than the elder ones. With the global situation deteriorating literally daily ... what sort of impact does that have on the mind of a young ENFJ who walks out the door and is exposed to death and fear? What impact does opening the TV have when images of death and destruction and disease are so rampant. So many of us empaths feel what others feel - sometimes I feel like I'm literally dying when I watch the TV now. 

So what's the new thought process? A lot of us have had to become much more objective in our views than we were inherently born to be. I wonder if that kind of growth is positive or negative ... or even if I should call it growth or de-evolution of the ENFJ archetype. 

I doubt that any ENFJ, at least here feels anything but a damning desire to lock up their empathy on a daily basis before stepping out into the world. I locked up mine for a good 5 or 6 years. How many ENFJ's have locked up theirs? How many walk around with metaphorical hoods over their heads and earplugs in their ears to drown out the misery of the real world. I know that I do ... and at times, the apathy that consumes my empathy fractures my soul in two as I have to realize that I have to walk through life with this hood. 

Anyways, as you all know, I've been critiquing the ENFJ archetype for several months now - and here's another critique - the idealized ENFJ may have been all those wonderful things as promised in these wonderful descriptions - but the modern day ENFJ can become an invisible shell of that former glory. 

The modern day ENFJ is exposed to a much larger scale of global misery than the ones preceding us [or at least that's how it feels to me - so apologies for a gross generalization], therefore a lot of tend to walk through life with blinders on ... calculating when and where and how to lock and unlock our empathy. In effect, becoming a relatively lukewarm and calculating empath. 

Fellow ENFJs ... feel free to share your experiences with regards to your experiences with empathy and how you calculate how much, or how little to feel empathy. In fact, can you even control it?",https://www.personalitycafe.com//threads/enfj-the-lukewarm-and-calculating-empath.81448/,,,,,,,,,,,

Yamisama,Help me understand this ENFJ!,"Hello guys. This is going to be long so bear with me please hehe ^ I really need your help to understand this friend better!!!

I'm a female INTP who has a male ENFJ friend. We are good friends considering the fact we met online, known each other for 4 months, live in different continents, and have different religions, backgrounds and languages lol

We talk everyday, he initiates all the conversations almost all the time, I tend to have irregular sleeping pattern or work schedule so I try to reply as fast as I could but sometimes end up making him wait for hours and hours. He never complained of that tho so I don't really know how he feels about it. 

He says he enjoys our video calls so much, we talk about everything, and we talk at least once or twice a week for hours. most of the time it's usless stuff or me encouraging him to have more fun and be less uptight about certain things, or teaching him something or giving my two cents on situations that he asks about. He feels thankful I helped encourage him buy things he really wanted but had so much anxiety buying them and often calls me smart ot whatnot. Also I help him with his English since he's studying it academically now.

Here comes the part that I don't understand. So, sometimes due to internet connection the call would end abruptly, obviously I call back again since we were in the middle of a conversation but he never answers or replies, I don't push it too much I call twice and send a ghost emoji or gif and call it quits because I don't want to annoy him, then he takes forever to respond and never addresses what happened clearly.

Lately he would tell me if he had another call to wait or not wait for him to continue and it seemed such an upgrade from the ""completely in the dark wait forever"" situation, until today when I started challenging him in philosophical questions, I asked how do you know right from wrong and kept asking more about his answers, at first he said he enjoyed the mind stimulation but then I think I liked the debate and wanted more haha guilty but in a middle of an interesting idea the internet just cut me off, I called back and no answer, called again after 5 minutes and the same. I didn't understand so I assumed maybe he was overwhelmed with my questions and thought I was against him or something so I sent him a message saying "" I'm a little sad that our conversation ended suddenly because it was so much fun and I was learning from him how to look at things differently and I'm going to sleep because I have work later. It's been two hours and he still didn't see or reply, this bothers me because I can't understand why he does it and I want your insight guys. Is this normal for you?

I'm really really dense, like no joke, I get things brilliantly sometimes and could be a useless rag other times, in this situation I feel like a rag. What am I missing? What is the wrong piece here?

phila,Difficulty with rejecting an ENFJ,"I have grown apart from one of my hometown friends, who is an ENFJ. We used to get along as kids because I think for the most part, few people out there are truly N, and she had a terrible home life (alcoholic mother / loud angry older brother) and I had no problem with her staying at my house most days in the summer because I honestly liked the effortless companionship. She was always interested in doing anything I wanted to do -- it was like my interests became her interests. And soon my other good friends became her friends -- she didn't have many friends at school, but I would invite her to things they would exclude her from, etc. Eventually she won most people over, as she had me. As we got older, I cared less and less about my ""social"" life, focusing more on academics, while her over the top energy and enthusiasm translated into being really active in our small town community, and befriending people from other towns etc. I was too shy to make that many new friends, but met lots of great people through her. To be clear -- she is one of the most social people I've ever met. Once we were older in high school I started to feel frustrated that she always put hanging out with virtual strangers above hanging out with what had become our core group of friends. I think it's because the rest of us were introverts, and just couldn't offer her the same level of excitement, etc. 

Long story short, we both started college, and it became even harder to maintain a deep / close friendship, and I felt myself somewhat mourning the loss of a friend. I would make so much effort to visit and see her, to make sure we didn't lose touch, but didn't receive the same in turn. She came back for the summer less and less, always with some new travel venture, internship, job abroad, etc. Meanwhile, I made great friends at college and had more than my share of friends from back home as well, so I was resigning myself to the idea that she and I were just growing apart. However I think she had never made deeper relationships with anyone else -- even after 4 years at college. In fact -- I'm honestly surprised that as social as she is, she graduated without anyone really close to her. I felt badly in fact. She was moving to NYC after graduation, and feeling lonely, so I introduced her to a few of my college friends. So she at least had people she knew. 

Shortly after graduation I cut the cord (nicely) -- I stopped putting all of the effort into the relationship that I had before, and as I expected it would, the friendship between us dwindled naturally -- however, as we were speaking less and less (not speaking at all tbh) I noticed that it seemed like she was very strongly clinging to the friends that I had introduced her to. Even now, I hear about what's going on in her life from my friends still living in NYC, than I do from her own mouth. 

TL;DR -- I wish my ENFJ friend, who did not seem to value our friendship, and who I have tried as nicely as possible to let go of, would respect my independence, instead of trying to get in with the social circles I have since formed apart from her. She is constantly showing up at events that I would like to enjoy like a best friend from college's birthday party, and will interrupt conversations I'm having with people at such events, to talk to THEM, not to me. That's actually the most common thing she does -- she sees me actually talking to someone, and she jumps in, pretending like we haven't had a huge falling out. It makes me really uncomfortable, and I wish she would just go away????? (Is that awful?) I just want to move on, and she makes it impossible by continuing to use my friends to force herself into my life. Once she sensed me backing away from an already pretty over friendship, this is when she began to do it, and I feel she began to do it even more the more I myself seemed to not want her around. I can think of no other reason than that she is doing this deliberately to antagonize me -- or to ""win"" my friends -- but that thought feels slightly paranoid, so I hope other ENFJs can shed light on what is occurring here.

I think she just doesn't handle rejection well. How can I talk to her that will make her feel less stung from my wanting to go separate ways. Any ENFJs with perspective? Please? I am very lost.",https://www.personalitycafe.com//threads/difficulty-with-rejecting-an-enfj.280786/,,,,,,,,,,,

zizzle,ENFJ and ENTP break up. Some help?,"Hey everyone,

Basically to keep the story as short as possible.
I'm the ENFJ and he is an ENTP.

I'm not guessing the types we have both tested ourselves 

Our relationship began suddenly and out of the blue he chased me wanted me complimented me and we fell in love. I guess seeming out of character for that type I don't know.
Basically we were together for nearing 2 years before we broke up 2 weeks back.
A few weeks before I noticed there was some stress on our relationship, he's at a cross roads in his life about where to head and unsure of his future. (We're both studying for our degree's)

Throughout the relationship he's always been worried he never made me happy or couldn't make me happy and that I was sad all the time. This was frequently the basis of any talk we'd need to have. (We always agreed to talk situations out rather than just break up)
I'm currently undergoing CBT and had moderate depression and moderate anxiety however 5 days before we broke up my depression had been classified as mild. I'm also super sensitive to my emotions, I can cry but not be sad but instead just be overwhelmed by the situation if that makes any sense at all.
He said he needed space also which I respected, I could have done better than I did however I left him to his devices with his friends and did stuff I needed to do like go to the library go out with friends etc.
I went to his to stay for the weekend and we had a lovely weekend ( I didn't get upset at all, my work stress was over I'd finished uni for christmas).
I went out with friends night before he broke up with me and stopped by inbetween to say hi before I went out for some drinks, he kissed me etc I didn't think anything of this.
Then the the next morning he messaged me that he would meet me at mine later, I found this worrying but thought he wanted some quality time.

He broke up with me. I've been distraught ever since. I couldn't eat. Sleep. He said he loved me and he wanted to be friends but he couldn't give me what I needed and he had been trying to get back to how we were before. He said a break wouldn't work for us and we needed to break up as he needed space. He said he couldn't see a future with me.
He dropped my stuff off soon after and said he had nothing to say, he just repeated he was sorry and that he wanted to talk in the new year after christmas and we'll see what happens and that maybe in the future and then went home.
The big point is he cried when he was breaking up with me which is so out of character really.

I'm struggling to understand why. I may sound desperate but I'm not I'm just confused. I'm so in love with this man and fully want to stand by his side through anything and everything. But he's up and disappeared which I believe is a common trait when entp's get stressed out. We never spent any quality time together the past few months any time we spent together was with his friends. I think he just got bored :/ and to be honest he possibly noticed I was upset he didn't want to spend that quality time with me, we had talked about it previously and his lack of effort lately (his mind was tied up in other commitments) I understood this and just gave him time to do those things and when I was round bring him a cup of coffee how he liked it 

I've given him his space since he left however and only text merry christmas by including him in my group text.
I don't know what to do. I have no insight into how he's feeling and whether he does love me and want me.
I mean he said he loved me.

I'm just confused and would like some insight into what he might be thinking or what he thought.
He said he made the decision to break up on the morning he did it which to me seems really fast for quite a long relationship.

I've been hanging out with my friends a lot more over the christmas period and I have plans for new year keeping myself busy but I miss everything about him. He was my best friend and my lover and now he only wants one. I want to know if he does care and that by leaving him be I'm not pushing him away :/

infpineapple,ENFJ best friend and crush is confusing me.,"Hello, I am an INFP (f) and one of my best friends/crush is an ENFJ (m). We've known each other for about a year through a common friend, but only started hanging out and then very quickly became close in the past 6 months or so. He has a girlfriend abroad whom he is in a long-distance relationship with, and they have had open relationships and breaks where they see other people before.
I'm personally really against making a move because he has a relationship, but I do still have feelings for him and keep wondering what he's about.

We usually see each other 4-5 times a week, sometimes alone, sometimes with a common friend group. I'm always the first he calls with good or bad news on work or other things. We both initiate conversations and hangouts. During the first 2 weeks of lockdown this year, he called me every evening before bedtime, sometimes to actually talk, sometimes with random things like to tell me he's hungry. I met all his family and friends. He invited me to come as his +2 to a wedding (I'll explain that later). One of our common friends told me once that when we hang out, he always directs everything he says at me. Another friend of mine asked if we were dating the first time she saw us together. Sometimes he seems to pull away and doesnt read or relpy to me for a day or two, but then sends a message like ""Hello"". When I don't reply for a couple of hours, he texts again or calls me. Although we were very close and talked about childhood stuff, future plans, etc, he never talked to me about his girlfriend until 1 month ago. When we go out, he usually already knows my usual orders for food and drinks and orders things for me, which is nice.
Those are all the things that make me think he likes me.

The things that confuse me are that he recently got an opportunity to go to the country where his gf will be. While he has known this for 2 months, he only mentioned the opportunity to me, but never mentioned his gf would be there too, no matter how many times we went over pro-con lists of staying or leaving. I found out during a coversation with another friend that the gf would move there too. Since then, he has been mentioning her more to me and tells me he's very happy about where he is in the relationship. But now, he has decided to not leave after all, eventhough he hasnt seen her in almost 2 years. And he's started telling me about other girls he used to date during their breaks, and how one of them has sent him a text, and it seemed like he was somewhat considering it. But when I asked more about what he wants, he just kinda stopped talking. We also have a common friend who used to have a crush on me (which enfj knows) but now has a gf. The three of us are really close-knit and enfj invites this person almost everywhere with us. If we have movie nights, he sits in the middle of us, we go see movies together, have dinners and drinks together at each others houses, and he was the other +2 invited to the wedding, etc.

What do you think, does this sound like he's just friendly? Or like he knows i have a crush and tries to keep distance because he doesn't want to affect the friendship? Or like he may have a crush too but tries to not act on it because he has a gf?

I'm at a point where I would be devastated if he left, but at least that would end the uncertainty. Now that he's staying, I'm just more confused.",https://www.personalitycafe.com//threads/enfj-best-friend-and-crush-is-confusing-me.1357451/,,,,,,,,,,,

Flora,Listening,"Do you consider yourselves good listeners?

I know a number of very good ENFJs friends in real life and they all have something in common, they can talk for hours!! They seem to very often to launch into monologues, tell anecdotes, recall things that have happened to them, about their families, their friends, their experiences, their likes, dislikes etc. and not always be aware of monopolising conversations or not letting people talk. When they listen, and they are thoughtful and polite, and genuinely listen and care, sometimes it looks like it's just a polite little break until you give them a cue and they can start again. One of them will nicely ask me a question, I tell her something that is bothering me and she will again tell me in every detail how her friend has dealt, successfully, of course, with the same issue. At that point they are not very interested in a conversation, for example, asking have you tried this or that and how did it go, and have you thought of, or I think that will be good etc etc., no, it seems all they want to do is share their story, and you have to listen, even if it¬¥s not really relevant because you keep on mentioning why that wont work for you?

I know another man that used to email me the longest emails, send me photos, share his experiences, tell me his thoughts..etc. I used to reply very sparingly because I wasn't interested in the same manner and I didn't want to lead him on, rather the opposite, hope he would get the message I was reciprocating because I wasn't interested. But when he finally found out I was indeed no interested, he reacted with a lot of verbal aggression and felt utterly hurt of my rejection after all we had shared. I was astonished as I hadnt shared hardly anything, deliberately but he was telling me so much stuff he was oblivious I wasnt?

Is this a manifestation of Fe? Giving, means giving your experience as well? I have noticed a few other friends (sensors and nfs) get sometimes rather impatient with it, you can tell, and I sometimes struggle to pay attention too, as there is a lot repetition and detail and I do the typical NF thing of letting your eyes wander around the room and start thinking about my things. I really dont want to be impolite, hurt them by appearing uninterested in what they have to say, offend them or anything of the sort, I love these people, but Im concerned one day when Im a bit grumpy Im going to get really impatient and say use three words not 3 hundreddddd!!! lol. Also ive noticed some of my friends are feeling a bit alienated sometimes because there seems to be a bit of oneupmanship with one of them (you do x they have done it before, bigger and better, etc)..

Is this a typical trait, or my friends just happen to be this way? Any advice, would saying something be ok or really offensive and a no no? 

Also, how can you say No to an enfj without offending? Thanks but NO I dont want another drink, seriously im fine, no really, ook, hmm thanks..cheers..I honestly dont..ok..haha fine and then leave the drink untouched?",https://www.personalitycafe.com//threads/listening.138674/,,,,,,,,,,,

happysediments,If you?ôre feeling charitable please help this ENFP thank u,"Hi ENFJs! An ENFP F here  Recently I had the pleasure of getting to know one of you and I would like to ask for some help discerning his attitude towards me (whether I?ôm just a friend to him or he views me as something more) because I CANT READ HIM AT ALL.. I?ôll try to keep it short and concise

Background:

Got to know him around 5months ago
I was secretly super wary of him because he seemed waaayy too nice and reminded me of people who I really dislike but I gave him the benefit of doubt
We don?ôt text but I got to know him better because I meet him coincidentally (on a weekly basis) & although I?ôm still quite wary of him, I feel like he generally has a good heart!

Reasons I?ôm overthinking:
1) He initiates physical contact/ likes to invade my personal space (touches my hand/shoulder etc + once, he was sitting beside me and put his foot at the bottom part of my barstool, the part where you can rest your leg at)
2) Gives me quite a lot of compliment (gave me a very sincere and warm-hearted compliment really early on whICH THREW ME FOR A LOOP, told me that I was ?úvery cute like a kid??and tells me that I make him laugh and brightens up his day EVERY TIME we converse)
3) Our other group mates told me that it was very obvious that he talks to me more in the group
4) He was unnecessarily nervous to talk about his past relationships (we were talking about it in our group)
5) Maintains very long eye contact with me when he speaks in the group
6) Both of us had an assignment due and although he was already done with it beforehand, he stayed back to help me with mine
7) Bought a pastry for me when he knew that I was staying back in school (he bought it when he was out of school but he had to come back to school for a certain project)
8) He replies almost instantly when I text him

Reasons why I think I?ôm overthinking:
1) I think he?ôs testing me because I mentioned I don?ôt like people who I don?ôt know invading my personal space and touching me without permission
2) He?ôs nice to everyone
3) I?ôve been told that I come off as genuine and weird by the rest so he probably thinks the same way and wants to just be a friend to this weirdo? HAHA
4) He helped his senior (a girl) to finish her report as well so I AINT SHIT REALLY...
5) Talks about treating food to other people as well but he never really does
6) Doesn?ôt initiate any text conversation with me

Honestly, I?ôm really just seeking clarity on this because I?ôm starting to feel pretty frustrated at this point. I wouldn?ôt say I?ôve developed a crush on him but this has been weighing on my mind for awhile now (that?ôs why I?ôve resorted to posting on this forum HAHAHAHAHAHAH).

Cappuccino,ENFJ - Words of Affirmation,"What are your favorite words of affirmation, compliments or words that have made you feel significant?
I?ôm an INFP and my partner is ENFJ, in the beginning of our relationship I gave him constant creative compliments but he always responded that I just had to say that because we were in a relationship and he really never believed me when I said he was special. I got so discouraged at being constantly shot down that I stopped saying as many nice things, but now he?ôs at a different place emotionally and really wants to hear affirming words from me. I?ôm naturally creative at describing my thoughts about him but since I?ôve become so discouraged, I need some help reviving my confidence.
I want to really make him feel confident, loved and significant, can you help me? What are examples of things people have said to you that you remember years later because it was so special?

Also, if you?ôve ever felt that way, where you don?ôt believe anything nice a romantic partner tells you, (even if you are willing to believe the same things from complete strangers) can you explain those feelings at all?",https://www.personalitycafe.com//threads/enfj-words-of-affirmation.1356102/,,,,,,,,,,,

Ironing Man,Relationship advice needed,"Hey guys, 
as this is going to be my first post on this forum, I might as well make it interesting. roud:

Now, the situation is that I'm in love with an ENFJ. The problem for me is recognising if she feels the same. For the last 4 years we've been going into the same class. At first we couldn't stand each other, while I was an akward nerdy nerd, she was quite popular, kinda agressive and pretty talkative. The years went by, we both matured and 2 years later we became friends. Pretty much, we just flirted with each other and that was basically our whole communication, I started falling for her, but the feeling wasn't mutual at the time.  :sad:

After that we haven't seen each other for some time, it was summer break, so some 2-3 months. The school started again and I went sailing. Interestingly, she contacted me on my last night of sailing just to hear how I was and what I was doing, at the time I didn 't think much of that, cause she's an enfj afterall. lol. By the end of the next month we became much closer friends again. Our chit-chatting is still flerting, teasing each other, and competing to be the best we can be. Honestly, I think its done wonders for both of us.

This winter break we couldn't see each other for a month (we live quite far each from the other), and she contacted me before christmas eve, that continued later to us chatting once a week during the period. I honestly didn't believe I could survive without her at the time. She even asked me that upfront, and I told her  that I don't really know how I'm gonna get through without her. Later, when we finally saw each other, we talked about some stupid unimportant things and she coldly turned to her phone and re-entered the conversation with me only when there were more people. We used to go together from the school to the bus, and whenever we are left alone it would seem I take the whole talking while she's a lot more quieter. I was wondering if she just doesn't want to hang out with me, but she always wanted us to go together, and she did laugh at all the stupid things I said.

On facebook she puts a lot of love songs and I can't help it, but I believe those are all meant to me. I also noticed I'm the only guy which gets her likes there, like everywhere.  On one ocassion, I said her I was watching a movie called ?ûCatch me if you can?? she said she could't and put a lot of smiley faces. The next day, she hugged me. It was her way of saying she got me apparently.

Now, I don't know if this is important, but we stare into each others eyes often. Sometimes openly, with both of us doing the same for some time, just gazing into each others eyes (I believe our record is 4 min. and we only stoped it cause we had work to do at the time). Other times, I catch myself just wanting to look at her and see whats she doing, or just to look into that green fiery eyes, I might be deluding myself but I sometimes catch her doing the same thing. Whenever one of us needs some help, it would seem the other one comes out of its way to help. I think we both enjoy talking to each other about, well, anything, and just be given a chance to look into each other more.  

To conclude this, how do I know if she's interested in a relationship in me? Is she just being her normal enfj, or what? I believe this Monday, before the Valentine's day its my last train to catch her. Now, I do know she's in love, but I cant really gasp it if its arrowed towards me. She's flirty by nature and thats the thing confusing me most about her. I do notice sometimes we just seem to accidently touch, but I'm still quite insecure. Am I just being Captain Obvious here or? 

Oh, and thank you for reading all this, any kind of advice is mostly welcomed. I would realy enjoy if theres a way in which I could get to know if she's really interested or even how to approach her regarding this matter. I just know I don't want to lose her and want her to be happy. I know theres a love hurting her, and if thats cause of me, we're both crazy. No matter how different we are, it always comes down that, beneath it all, we are the same. Omg, I really do need to grow some fucking balls. We are both 18 and finishing high school, if it has any value.",https://www.personalitycafe.com//threads/relationship-advice-needed.462122/,,,,,,,,,,,

disnx,An innocent question about ENFJs.,"Hi, guys. I've met one of you for the first time in my life. She's my coworker and we have a 15+ age difference, but she's the only other teacher I feel comfortable around. At first, I didn't think we'd be this close because she seemed to really like organization and things that are ""proper"", but now we talk about a lot of things. 

My question is this: I've recently started to wonder whether she was truly an ENFJ or not, because she loved recalling funny anecdotes about her family, and has a really good detailed memory about what happens here at the school, in a way I don't think I've ever seen someone with Se do.

green.bob,dating phase between male ENFJ and female ENFP - is he interested?,"I recently met a male ENFJ at a party and I felt like we immediately bonded. We talked for hours even though there was a party going on and he ended up kissing me at the end of the night. We also had a conversation about drugs and he told me about one time he took mushrooms, how amazing it was, the deep connection he felt to himself and nature, then he proposed me to take it together one day. Like even for me as an ENFP I felt like this came quite fast, like you don't want to make experiences like this with everyone right?

The next day, he texted me and was really sweet, saying he would like to get to know me better and asked if I'd like to meet up soon. We met a few days later and we had the most romantic date ever. We both live in Paris and he took me to this rooftop with a view of whole Paris, took wine cheese and baguette with him (like come on, how French can someone be??) then we biked around the city, discovered some places and ended up in this cute little library where, guess what, there was a piano and he started playing... like... I didn't know dates like these exist outside of movies?•∫

I only had like 4 days left in Paris before going to Germany for about one month and even though he was really busy that week he assured me that we would see again before I'd leave. We saw each other two days before I left and I went at his place for the night. We immediately started making out but I just can not have sex with someone I barely know which he realized without me saying it so he stopped. The first couple of hours at his place felt kinda weird, I guess I wasn't really present and was overthinking the whole situation way too much... He then started asking me what kind of relationship I would like to have and told me that if I'm searching for affection/ sth. serious he wouldn't be the one and that he tries to focus on his career... (bad sign for an ENFJ I guess)

We talked about relationships in general and I opened up to him and told him a story that left some terrible scars on me and also is the reason why I can't just fuck around.. He was really understanding and sweet but when we got to talk about the relationships he had so far, he didn't want to get in detail. 

After that we made out for like an hour but only kissing and touching since he knew I didn't want to go further and it felt just sooo good. Even though we didn't have sex it felt so damn intimate and passionate and I'm pretty sure he felt so too. After that, he said to me that he prefers just having passion without sex over having it the other way round. 

So I'm confused, if he doesn't want to have something serious, why doesn't that bother him? (don't get me wrong, I think it's great that he thinks so but if he's neither looking for a relationship nor for sex, what's his goal then?)

I'm kinda afraid, he didn't enjoy the first few hours of that night because I really was a little awkward ( I have this huge problem where sometimes I'm just disconnecting in a situation, I'm still answering and everything but the conversations you can have with me just won't be that amazing since my mind is elsewhere...?•∫ I'm a weirdo) 

Do you think it's possible that he told me he wasn't interested in sth serious because in that moment he just thought I was boring or something but changed his mind afterwards? I know that ENFJs would not take excuses to get into a relationship with someone once they're head over heels in love which would mean that he's just not that interested but  it still felt as if there where other signals proving the opposite. Like the physical attraction between the two of us is really strong, I'm quite sure that he feels so too and also the next day he sent me a text hinting that we wants me to come back soon... 

What do you think ENFJs out there?

nicesoul,Enfj girl disappearing?,"Hey guys, I?ôve never posted on here but I have a question for enfj girls.
Is it normal for an enfj to disappear when they have intense feelings for someone? I just met an enfj girl and i really think we?ôre in love. I believe we are soul mates I really do. I?ôm also an infp male.
We met at this certain place unknowingly, but ever since I went up to talk to her, she hasn?ôt showed up there again. I can tell she was blown away when I approached her. I saw somewhere that when an enfj girl really likes someone she might get shy and try to hide it but I saw right through it when she did that. 
She was literally there almost every day passionately flirting with me for awhile (non verbally) and since I talked to her she hasn?ôt been there since. I am panicking because I am in love and I think she is too. It?ôs so painful for me that she just disappeared though. I can tell she really really is in love with me. I know people say love at first sight doesn?ôt exist, but I believe when you?ôre soul mates it does. The feeling I get from being around her is magical and I?ôve never felt it before. 
this is just so hard for me because I don?ôt have her contact info and she isn?ôt coming anymore. I do think she will come back eventually but what does this mean when an enfj girl behaves in this way?
Thank you so much for your answers. It will provide me great relief.",https://www.personalitycafe.com//threads/enfj-girl-disappearing.1354901/,,,,,,,,,,,
gromit,Dysfunctional ENFJ - How do I realise my full potential?,"I feel dysfunctional. I have been told I don't let go. This used to be a reasonably positive trait when I was working because I would keep at it until I found a solution, but apparently in a social situation it can be very annoying. Found advice on this forum about walking. Just today I decided I would try to walk regularly. I often do a 10k bike ride. There is a beautiful, calming walk near my house. 
Am I really an ENFJ? I remember being told I was something very unusual when I did the Myers-Briggs at work years ago. The tutor told me he was the same and always seemed to use a different route to get from a to b. I'm definitely dysfunctional.
My husband has just left me and I think the main reason is that I caused tension in the poker group. He is a pleaser and easily led. 
I remember as a kid I used to deliberately say something controversial so I could then charm anyone who didn't like my opinion out of their bad humour. Hmmmmm. Do I still do that?

Enicma,Struggling to become a healthy ENFJ,"Hi you all!

[my apologies for the long story but I think this amount of context is relevant for my question]

I am an ENFJ, and I have some serious concerns. I was hoping some of my fellow ENFJs could help me a little. I have been struggling for a long time, and would really like to become a healthy ENFJ instead of the unhealthy state (I think) I am in now.

For this I should probably add some information. I my early childhood I was raised by my parents not to be assertive at all. This caused me a lot of problems when I went to school. I used to be very outgoing, and made friends easily. If I remember correctly I understood from an early age how easily I could manipulate people, and feel how they felt. It was all quite innocent. 

Then at the age of 6 the bullying began. I took this all very personal and my parents told me to ignore it (probably the biggest fail ever). This continues to get worse and worse. And I became a very quiet kid that at one point stopped connecting with people. I ""became"" very introvert, and tried to focus on science and all things not involving too much human interaction. I had very dark thoughts about my life, followed an education way below my level, and started to behave really bad around the age of 13. 
Somehow I needed to be noticed, even if it resulted in a lot of negative attention. This did not get a lot better. My father was unable to advise me, never had a real connection, and he never had any real interest in me besides the usual name calling and telling me how bad I was. My mom got in a wheelchair, and I was required to pick up some of the chores, for which a was actually a bit too young. At this age I did not really have any real friends anymore and was completely isolated. This continued until around my 18th when I got really rebellious and started hanging out with the wrong types. 

Finally I dropped out of school, and next I moved on to a computer science education (again below my level but I didn't have any proper 'papers'). Finally with all these geeks and nerdy types the bullying stopped. I thought I was a similar type they were and believed that for years.

Now, almost 15 years later; I have been struggling with my identity like crazy. I have become very extroverted, I would like to presentations within communities relevant to my work, and I love training and educating my co-workers. I have a recent history with psychologists, and after they could not help me any further I found myself a personal coach.

This has helped me very very much to develop myself. However I still struggle with a few things and I have no clue how to fix them, how to improve myself. And FYI my girlfriend and I recently broke up from a 7 year relationship. And I mover to a new place where I don't know anyone.  

The two things I struggle with most. I am doing awful at scheduling and keeping friends. People like me, but I don't tend to follow up. I know what I want to do, but when something more fun comes along I am distracted and don't finish that thing I really wanted to do. I am at a point where I don't really want to bother going out anymore to meet new people. Well I actually but think no good will come of it. 

This is all really troubling to me, and I struggle to find a solution. Any advice, and tips would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks!",https://www.personalitycafe.com//threads/struggling-to-become-a-healthy-enfj.1096362/,,,,,,,,,,,

thisjourneynow,ENFJ man no longer responsive,"ENFJs: help!

My husband left me a few months ago and I was devastated. And this ENFJ's guy's girlfriend of many years cheated on him and left him last year. He was pretty torn up over it.

I met this ENFJ a couple years ago and we became fast friends, often flirting, even though I was with my husband and he was with his girlfriend.

A few months after my husband left me, I had sex with this ENFJ. I found out he had liked me since we first met. He also said he is very picky about who he has sex with and I am the first person he's been with since his gf left. Other things he has said: he is ""scared"" of me, he wants to have sex but doesn't want a relationship, he doesn't know what will happen between us but he really wants me to meet his mom and his family, and ""why are you being so nice to me?""

So when this intimacy started a month ago, it moved very fast and we hung out a lot. He would call or email to hang out with his friends or at his house. Or he would just call because he missed me. 

I showed up once uninvited when I was in the neighborhood. But I thought this was okay because I had often done this throughout our friendship anyway (sometimes with my husband), to drop off cookies or chat. However, I don't know if I somehow crossed the line when I dropped by after we started having sex.

The last couple times I stayed over, he said it didn't matter if I stayed over or if we hung out. Then he seemed pretty cold when I left in the morning. He would open the door and just have this distance as I walked out. Now we haven't seen each other in about a week and a half. I finally texted him to ask how he was. He said he was annoyed at something, said it was a long story, and would tell me about it later. He asked how I was. I told him I was doing well and asked when we were going to hang out again (in a playful way). He didn't respond.

I'm confused. What happened? Why did we go from hanging out a lot to not seeing each other anymore?",https://www.personalitycafe.com//threads/enfj-man-no-longer-responsive.113136/,,,,,,,,,,,
Nobleheart,ENFJ Enneagram Types,"The different Enneagram types have a very distinguishing effect on how ENFJs manifest their personalities.  Each Enneagram type creates a different type of ENFJ.  This is because each Enneagram type affects how the ENFJ uses their Fe.

First, let's define Fe.  At it's core, Fe is simply Feeling and Extraversion.




			Those who prefer feeling tend to come to decisions by associating or empathizing with the situation, looking at it 'from the inside' and weighing the situation to achieve, on balance, the greatest harmony, consensus and fit, considering the needs of the people involved.
		
Click to expand...





			Myers-Briggs literature uses the terms extraversion and introversion as Jung first used them, and preserves the original spelling of extraversion. Extraversion means ""outward-turning"" and introversion means ""inward-turning.""[17] These specific definitions vary somewhat from the popular usage of the words.

The preferences for extraversion and introversion are often called as attitudes. Briggs and Myers recognized that each of the cognitive functions can operate in the external world of behavior, action, people, and things (extraverted attitude) or the internal world of ideas and reflection (introverted attitude). The MBTI assessment sorts for an overall preference for one or the other.
		
Click to expand...

When we combine these factors, the result is something much more encompassing than the simple factor of ?úcaring about people?? which is honestly a misnomer based on the misinterpretation of the use of the word 'extroversion'.  Jung?ôs definition is spelled 'extraversion' to make the distinction between social attitude and mental perspective.  

The definition of Fe is much broader than that, and is more literally ?úFeeling based reasoning oriented outwardly??

That being the case, how each of us manifests our Fe is strongly influenced by our Enneagram type.  While MBTI type indicates perspective, Enneagram indicates our motivations.  For ENFJs, this means Enneagram type will flavor the focus of our Fe because our outward feelings are influenced by our motivations.

Type 1 ??In this type, Fe manifests most strongly as a sense of right and wrong, how things should be.  In this type, we see Fe?ôs drive to control the user?ôs environment and apply ideological truth more so than Fe?ôs desire to care about others.  Type 1 ENFJs are commonly 1w2.

Type 2 ??This is the most common type for ENFJs, and therefore it?ôs no surprise that with this type, Fe manifests as a care and concern for others.  Because this combination is so common, a lot of the standard description of ENFJs includes Enneagram Type 2 sensibilities.  If you?ôre a different Enneagram type, this will explain why some of the ENFJ description isn?ôt quite accurate for you.

Type 3 ??Fe manifests as a sense of how things should be, and creates the drive to make them so.  There is also an expectation of others??reaction, as well as a clear sense of where the individual should be socially.  Type 3 ENFJs are commonly 3w2.

Type 4 ??Fe manifests as a sense of how things should be both for the individual as well as their environment in a rather self oriented manner, insisting on aesthetics, conventions, and their unique tastes.   These ENFJs can be very elitist and feel very passionately about these things.  Type 4 ENFJs tend to have a notably strong Ni that can often confuse them with INFJs or INFPs.  

Type 5 ??These ENFJs are quite rare, but when they manifest as type 5s, these ENFJs feel very strongly about what they know to be correct and incorrect, as well as their need to be useful to the people they care about.  Type 5 ENFJs often have a strong Ti.

Type 6 ??These ENFJs manifest their Fe in a balanced mix of concern for others, their social status, security, loyalty, ideology, and their physical environment.  This is a less common Enneagram type for ENFJ, but is actually the most balanced use of Fe, focusing on everything Fe is used for rather evenly.

Type 7 ??Fe manifests itself in a whirlwind of care for others through the need for fun.  These ENFJs are the life of the party.  While other Type 7s can be very self serving in their pursuit of fun, excitement, and happiness, ENFJ 7s use their Fe to make sure everyone else is having fun too.  In a way, ENFJ 7s are much like lively 2s.

Type 8 ??These ENFJs primarily manifest Fe?ôs need for right and wrong and to control their environment because of a need for justice in an unjust world.  Fe?ôs sense of how things should be includes self sufficiency, strength of character, and independence, which can seem paradoxical to Fe?ôs standard definition.  ENFJ 8s almost always have a strong Se and are often 8w9s.

Type 9 ??Fe manifests as a desire for harmony in the environment through Fe?ôs sense of how things should be.  For an ENFJ 9, things should be harmonious.  Right and wrong, caring for others, and control of the environment are also important, but are secondary to the imperative for harmony.  ENFJ 9s are often 9w1s.",https://www.personalitycafe.com//threads/enfj-enneagram-types.36816/,,,,,,,,,,,

xEmilyx,Forbidden Enfj Love,"So this enfj guy I like is on a mission for the church so essentially hes off limits, but I'm wondering if he even likes me. 

I had him talk to me into the we hours of the night, maybe midnight and i spill out my life story which i as an infj dont EVER do lol. And he says that it happens to him often lol I dont know what it was about him, but he made me want to spill my guts out and in the end he gave me the LONGEST most amazing 25-30second hug and kept telling me I was going to be okay. Whenever he looks at me it's almost like our eyes catch eachother and we cant look away but we do it in a way that I think keeps the other guessing. Long, but not long enough. He has an Adoring and intense gaze I guess I could say. 
He was always following me around when he was helping me pack the house up (we were helping move a lady) when the other missionaries were doing something else. He sang with me while we worked (I never do that fyi lol) and he was like a puppy dog with me.  My friend said I had him wrapped around my finger and that he did like me. Lol but still his reaction tonight made me wonder.

 So i essentially told him that i liked him over text since he lives so far away and of course he couldnt respond to it because hes a missionary and would get in trouble if he did, (and or he didnt respond because he didnt like me). But i said we could be just friends and he agreed. (But they're supposed to say that, since no romantic relationships are supposed to be happening on the mission) 
The next time I saw him at a family gathering, his family gathering I was invited to by his cousin, he almost pretended I wasnt there, he was kindof avoiding me and acting awkward.

And when he was talking in front of the group his eyes kept locking on mine, and if he had even looked a split second longer people would have probably said ""oOOooh""  (so he likes her!) Kind of thing. he went from mr. Chatty box to mr. Awkward avoidance with me. I kindof avoided him too, I was too scared of him.  Lol 
I was giving people hugs goodbye and planned on not giving mr enfj a hug but after I hugged someone else and turned away, he kindof nearly hesitantly opened walked towards me wanting to give me a hug. So I hugged him, but it was like a hug that made you think ""boy he didnt really want to touch me"" lol 
He quickly hugged me, and smiled then left. 

He would answer all of my texts and all of my voice texts before and after I had told him I liked him. 
He is very charming, handsome and kind. But I found out hes very talkative and enthusiastic with everyone. But it was like he talked to everyone but me, he did respond to a comment I said but not much else. I dont know what to do with this. He litterally made me think he hates me and thinks I'm gross because he avoided me lol. Idk. What do you think?",https://www.personalitycafe.com//threads/forbidden-enfj-love.1353753/,,,,,,,,,,,

Goodewitch,ENFJ The INFJ's Blindspot.,"Hello ENFJ's. 
As an INFJ, I do find reading peoples motivations pretty easy, but I do have a blindspot when it comes to figuring out the intentions of ENFJ's, especially romantic intentions. I know you folk are massively friendly and can dazzle with your Fe, but unless its really spelled out for me, I'm damned if I can tell wether an ENFJ just likes me, or is being nice, or really 'likes' me, you know? My question is, do you as an ENFJ keep things deliberately vague until you decide to show your hand, or do you feel its just your natural state to have a somewhat fluid kind of friendliness/flirtation vibe going on most of the time?

Infinitus,INTJ & 'improving' Fe,"Hi lovely ENFJs. Excuse my cringe post. 

INTJ here. Fe is my weakest function. It's embarrassingly absent, you could say I avoid Fe at every step if I can. Or even worse, socially disregard it and unintentionally hurt people. Yup, I'm a harsh mofo like that. That's how it be. However, I'm determined to try to be more comfortable using and appreciating Fe within reasonable limits to my personality. All in pursuit of being a more rounded individual. I realise this is no easy feat, & perhaps it's not even possible for certain individuals. Left to my own devices I will likely never change sans some unforeseen life changing event. That's not good enough for me.

Since you are intuitive & Fe dom, I figure you're the first choice to help me grasp whether it's even possible that an INTJ could wilfully ""max out"" their Fe. If not, it might still be an interesting discussion. So, can we INTJs use our particular set of skills to learn to appreciate and develop this shadow function? If so, what are your ideas on how we can systematically do this? Not expecting miracles here, but any improvements are surely worthwhile. If you can give us insight, we can (attempt to) come up with and implement the plan

Moby,ENFJ Appearing As An ENTJ?,"Have you ever been told you appear as an ENTJ sometimes?

My now-girlfriend is an ENFJ yet she seems to have such strong extroverted thinking (Te) sometimes. She's an excellent teacher and mentor, as ENFJs seem to be, but it can come off as pretty ""declarative"" and she's also an entrepreneur with many business initiatives...She developed a candy business at age 13 and even sold ""franchises"" to kids at her school. She owned three businesses at a time as of this year.

Yet, she's very loving, accepting, mature, physical, and affirmative, so she also seems very ENFJ a lot too.

unaware715,Am I really ENFJ?,"The most popular answers I got from the analysis was ENFJ, and I'd like to know if at least some of you can relate to me- 
if not, which mbti do you think I am? 

Thanks for reading in advance! 

Here are some things about me - perhaps thoughts process idek: 

1) I try my best to help out those who are in need, but that doesn't mean I like people - in fact, 
I'm too lazy to hang out with people or make new friends (I fake myself to seem like easy-going and amiable) 

2) I understand why some people are quite observant in a way that they notice small things from strangers, but 
I don't find it that necessary - like I seriously don't care whatever is going on in the surroundings.


Example 1) My friend and I hung out in the mall, and my friend was keep talking about some couple sitting behind our seats having a serious argument (like the girl is crying) - and I was very uninterested bc it was none of my business...


Example 2) My cousins were so annoyed at some couples doing PDA and I was wondering why do they care so much to the point that they'd waste their energy on strangers.


Example 3) Some group of people literally laughed at some stranger acting a bit weird back in school - and yeah, I didn't care at all. 

3) I often get scolded by my boss in my part-time job, and I think that's normal because we learn from getting told off by someone, right? There was one time when my boss just tapped my shoulder a bit lightly with a bit of stern tone just to remind me, then my friend later asked me if I was okay, because he thought my boss went too far for 'hitting me' - and I told him to chill because I didn't take it personally (I sometimes think my friend is a bit sensitive, so it makes sense why he thought of it like that).

4) From what I said in No.3, I really don't think criticism is all about attacking one another on personal level. It's all about learning and growing. 

5) ....I can't remember people too well.............

6) I really don't care about what others say about me unless it's something that I think I need to improve on. Thus, I try to not to compare myself with the other people anymore. 

7) I don't reply to messages instantly unless it's important. 

8) I seem like I can get along with anyone but it takes forever to get to know me as a person c: 

9) I disappear randomly, and appear out of nowhere

10) I get stressed when people get in the way of my daily routine or rules - like I was a bit annoyed when my friend wouldn't get up from the bed when I always have to do bedmaking at 9 A.M. And, ah yeah, I don't like it when there's no proper system or fixed work hours in work - I was so stressed about this back in my prev internship. 

If you find this too vague or hard to analyse, please feel free to ask me more questions - although I hate being pried but I'd like to find myself more.

theicecandle,confusion about enfj's feelings,"Hi everyone,

A girl who I value a lot is an ENFJ type, she took the test last year, I tend to take the test once a year and I get IFNP/ENFP (varies by the test, I usually get 51-49 E/I score).

She got out of a relationship about 9 months ago. We talked and saw each other occasionally (but not more than once every two weeks) during the two years I've known her before that, that is, we never got to know each other deeply

In March, I told her about a crush I have on some other girl, and shortly after we went into quarantine and were unable to see each other, since then we talked almost every day in chats, sometime in May, she confessed that she had a crush on me, and she realized that she does when I told her that I have a crush on someone else, this was after we talked every day for more than a month, and in the same conversation she told me she isn't ready for a relationship and she don't know why she told me about her having a crush on me, I responded by telling her that I don't like her like that and I moved on (to save her face, as she was really embarrassed) and that it is OK, and that I understand that she was confused and I think we both should forget it ever happened

We kept chatting every day with the rare video chat once in a while, but I was not expecting anything more. A month later was her birthday (June), we were fresh out of quarantine and I got her a present, the present was customized to her, we went for walks on the beach every weekend (we live right next to it) and we talk for an hour or two before heading home, she mentioned during the walks that she shouldn't have said anything and she isn't ready for a relationship and doesn't want our friendship to stop

Now, this is the problem; she has a rare type of diabetes, she was on extreme medication during these months and currently she is fighting it with medication and winning, about a month ago she got off her strong medication and now taking very light one and when she told me the news, I wanted to congratulate her, so I called a few times for a video call and she never picked up, just telling me she doesn't want to or telling me she will call later but never does. She also is very busy with work, as they're releasing a big update soon and she works around 12 hours a day; during the time, she answers messages extremely late and doesn't hold a conversation, although she has been getting more and more active messaging me, she stopped sending funny pictures on FB about three months ago and she just responds to what I send her.

During the few months we talked, I never thought of her as more than a friend, and although I liked her very much, all my intentions were just friends. I think in the last month, I developed feelings for her, so I asked her that if I should ask her out on a date after COVID19 is over (we both have medical conditions that put us as high-risk, so we barely leave the house) and she told me ""I don't have feelings for you, I like you as a friend, you're one of my best friends but I don't have feelings for you"" and that ""she never liked me, she just had a crush on me"" (like, as in extra like) and that crushing is not serious for her. She also told me that if she liked me, then she will tell me as she doesn't hide these feelings (although she managed to hide her crushing well for over three months). I respected her wishes and (tried to) moved on, I continued to text her every day with goodmornings and goodnights like we did during the last few months.

Today, I had a breakdown, I told her about it and she called and we spent three hours in a video chat talking to each other, now I am having troubles on how to proceed with this, she barely texts first and sometimes she is online for hours before she responds. But I think spending three hours in a videochat when she dislikes video chats is a bit too much for any friend, and I was wondering if she is just afraid of telling me that she likes me because she is still fighting her disease or because she is afraid of commitment, or if she really did move on and just see me as a friend now.

I really like her, but if she only sees me as a friend I want to move on with my life and stop crushing on her (I think I can do it even if we talk daily and not lose her friendship). But I am confused as I don't understand where she stands with me. Does she just see me as a friend and I should move on, or does she have a little bit of emotions for me and trying to not confront them for whatever reason (for example: doesn't want a relationship when she is still taking (heavy) medicine, unsure of her feelings, afraid of commitment, etc...). I am trying to figure her out and I can't, and I think I should believe her when she says ""I don't have feelings"" as she never lied to me before.

What do you think? as an ENFJ, would you spend hours chatting with someone every day and even video calling for hours for someone who you don't have feelings for?",https://www.personalitycafe.com//threads/confusion-about-enfjs-feelings.1352610/,,,,,,,,,,,

bmuddy120,"Master Roshi (ENFJ) - Fe dom and Ni aux user, One of the Greatest ENFJs ever of all time, Dragon Ball Z MBTI","Master Roshi ENFJ - Dragon Ball Z MBTI

Master Roshi MBTI - DBZ Myers-Briggs Types

Sharing this with PerC of course, share your thoughts down below.

Master Roshi is ENFJ from Dragon Ball, I've seen so many people confused on Master Roshi through the years. They've mistyped him ESTP, ESFP, INTP and many more mistypes in my opinion. Roshi is a Fe dom and Ni aux, people think Se dom cause he's silly in Z and think he's ESFP for some reason and even ESTP is a worse typing for him too as he acts nothing like an ESTP at all which that stupid database site has his mistyped as right now which as we all know is very inaccurate anyway and is bad at typing characters and people often and just care about popularity bias an negativity. So here's my proof on why Master Roshi is a clear ENFJ from Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball Z.

Master Roshi cares for society values and is always thinking about the emotional state of others all the time. He hit Goku on the head with his wooden cane when he said ""Hiya!"" to the monk when they were training on the mountain with the milk cartons, Roshi hit Goku on the head for being disrespectful and said that's not how you greet someone, its ""Good morning"" he corrected him with saying instead showing his care for Fe society values and manner and respect here in this scene. Master Roshi is always focusing on the group and group of people and goes out of his way to help others in a Fe style way and is a very emotionally supportive person with his Fe caring about these things and people's feelings, emotional state and well being and future of their lives as well with his Ni aux going along with his Fe. He's very insightful with his Ni and is very, very future oriented with his Ni aux as well. He went extremely far and out of his way with his Fe to help people and focus on Krillin and Goku's well being in the the tournament as fighters and to help influence them and help them understand a life lessons for their own good and futures as martial artist past this tournament, clear Fe focusing on others and a group of people's state and well being and focusing on what's going on behind the scenes and the future of his pupil's lives and the future of their lives as martial artists by teaching them the Ni lesson of there will always be someone stronger so don't be complacent and don't care only about the moment and your current strength and power because there's stronger guys out there in the future for you to face one day and this always will be a thing so keep training.

ENFJ is the perfect typing for Roshi and he uses his Ni aux again to read between the lines and look behind the scenes with his Ni aux to care and figure out what was going on with Namu by wondering with his intuition about him and his life. He then stopped speculating and thinking about it with his Ni and Fe caring about his well being and then mind read him and figured out what his past was. After the fight he lost to Goku he used his Fe dom behavior and was giving and emotionally supportive to him with his Fe and gave him a capsule that he could put water in so that he could help his people. Namu thanked him for this and he said no problem and then gave a Fe and Ni speech about how he's in disguise to teach the boys a life lesson on there's always someone stronger out there for them to fight in the future and that they need to know this as kids here and that he's looking out for their well being with his Fe and there future's as martial artists with his Ni here as well. And Goku as an ENFP and innocent ENFP and Si user remembered this lesson the whole entire series and never forget with his Si inferior and ENFP innocence and Ne that there's always someone stronger out there in the future to battle and train for at all times. In the end this mentality worked and worked out perfectly for Roshi and his teachers to them and Goku here and it matching his ENFP personality and Si again learning and remembering the life lesson for life as a martial artists and his Ne seeing the possibility and imagining strong guys always being out there at all times to fight and train for anyway, so it all worked out and matched perfectly in the end. Master Roshi, one of the greatest ENFJs of all time.

It's time to give mad respect to the GOAT ENFJ with Master Roshi and his character. He's one of the most important and best ENFJs ever out there ever in my opinion and is one of the most important characters in Dragon Ball history, I would say he's third most important next to Bulma first and Goku in my opinon to the series as he created the Kamehameha and trained Goku the best fighter ever of all time and Krillin too the strongest human on Earth. Roshi also is always having company over in his house even if he's a lone on an island, he's clearly an extrovert despite his home location and solitude, he loves having people around him and in his social circle and doesn't mind a lot of people living in his house at one time either in his life and welcomes it and them their to live with him with problem at all. He's social, energetic, lively, and funny and knows how to have a good time as well and can sometimes live for the moment with his Se ter and he struggles to think logically with his Ti inferior sometimes and this is especially evident in his perverted moments when he ignores logic with his low Ti inferior function and values and only cares for emotion, seduction, and lust when he sees a hot girl that he likes and wants to be around with. He also showed Fe and caring for the emotional state of Goku during his fight with Cell and caring about the group there in that moment and scene as a whole and was reading between the lines and looking behind the scenes with his Ni aux here as well and suspected something was up with him and Goku isn't acting strangely in this fight against Cell and that he wants to know where he's going with his since it seems like he can't win the fight and battle it seems that his Ni aux insight picks up on while watching the Cell Games progress on TV.

If you want to see my opinion in depth why I type Goku an ENFP and Ne dom and Si inferior user, check out why here in this post I made with him recently:



Master Roshi appears as ENFJ here as well on the Dragon Ball Z MBTI Chart by Personality Club, as usual I agree with the character typings for everyone except for I disagree with Videl and Android 16 here. I type Videl ENTJ and Android 16 ISFJ in my opinion:

ThirdArcade,Feeling incredibly depressed,"Last night I just cried my eyes out. My INFP husband was talking about all these things I told him I was when we first got married - organized, clean, tidy, community-minded, active. This lead to larger apparition for me- I am not any of these things.
Lately I?ôve been feeling so down and depressed. Since the start of the pandemic, I lost all my social outlets. Being new to the city I live in (almost 2 years), my only social outlets were work and gym. My gym is closed permanently. I was taking group classes there and now they and many other places aren?ôt offering group classes. I work at a college, and now we are all mandated to work from home. Outside of these two places, I don?ôt socialize much. Also, I haven?ôt been able to move these relationships outside those spaces. For example, I?ôve got only 1 close coworker who I interact with outside of work and no one from the gym. Ordinarily exercise has been a great stress reliever, but now I feel too tired to even use the equipment I have at home. I am waiting for my former trainer to open his facility up (just feel the need to be loyal), but that isn?ôt anytime soon. 
After work I have little to no energy to be with people or do anything for myself. To top it off I have no family in the city I live in. I feel incredibly lonely and at times, just isolated. I can?ôt even get myself to do simple things like cook a meal (I just eat out) and mostly watch TV. I don?ôt feel any happiness beyond finishing my Masters. My workplace didn?ôt even bother to get me a card and congratulate me. My celebration with my husband was small, with just his two friends. He got me a bunch of flowers which was nice.

I wonder if we all think the same, but are we all looking for that ONE special person to come and be our wife? I personally have a hard time falling in love, and I've fallen in love a few times in my life. I'm in my mid 20s, and I still haven't found the one yet. Now the other personalities have been telling me to date around, but I'm not that type of person. I'm waiting for that spark, and when the fireworks explode, that's when I know she'll be the one. I don't know, any other of you VERY RARE ENFJs feel the same? 

I also feel that a lot of people think I'm weird that I'm very independent and enjoying my singleness, but I do think about this from time to time. I sometimes think I won't find that one special person who I will love and cherish and go in an adventure with. Like ESFPs tell me I should sleep around with women and stuff, but that's not me (and I don't think that's many other ENFJs). We're very loyal to who we love, and we don't want to lose that purity that we want to have when we get married. 

I have my idealisms of marriage, of happiness, etc etc, but knowing other ENFJ guys, I think we all think the same in terms of serving our wives and loving them, being there for them, protecting them and our children, raising them to be incredible people who will change the world one day, but yeah, being a dreamer/giver/teacher/sacrificial altruist, what do all you all say?",https://www.personalitycafe.com//threads/enfj-males-and-marriage.137794/,,,,,,,,,,,
SolarSoul,Please help a(nother?) clueless INFP-male pursue a terrific ENFJ-gal,"I (m32, INFP) met a wonderful ENFJ (f28) via an online dating app (not knowing she was an ENFJ). We met up two times and had a profound connection and similar views, goals, ambitions and interests on so many topics. However, unfortunately, I felt intimidated by her (mostly assumed) extroversion and apparently very rich, active, busy and social life, and withdrew into friendship mode almost right away. So no flirtatiousness, mysteriousness or innocent touches from my side, and neither from hers. I didn't even try! We just talked and talked about all our many shared interests and feelings, uninhibitedly sharing like everything including all the insecurities and less desirable things, awkward moments included.
That's how I learned that she is not at all like I envisioned her to be, but a very vulnerable, sensitive, complex and deep, empathetic, affectionate, wonderful being and woman; and an ENFJ.

Where I only felt friendship at first, now, feelings for her are arising inside me big time! But I am afraid I may have ruined it already by my being passive and awkward and not making any moves on her at all. I might over-intellectualize, but I had a feeling she was disappointed at the end of meetup (date?) two.
Then again, it was her who after meetup one wanted to see me again soon, and it was her who has suggested our next activity after date/meetup two, despite her being very busy and having lots of friends already.

That's where I am at, and I so, so very much desire a little help from you experts! So far, I never really looked into the ENFJ type, but apparently it can be a mutually great match for an INFP, on top of all our commonalities, and she actually might like me despite or even for my introversion and awkwardness?!
Insecurities and idealizations aside, I really want to turn away from the friendship route and pursue her and not ruin it!

So, as much as I would like to just talk for a few more dates, I probably need to make clear that I desire her, don't I? That is if it's not too late, already. My most natural style of pursing somebody would be with being very affectionate and thoughtful, treating her with heartfelt interest, praise, sweet words and artistic gifts. However, I am afraid that this would be too cowardly and slow and I better try to get across the touch barrier soon, no? Or can you think of a less intense way of testing the waters?
I'm not very experienced, least of all with ENFJs.

Summers00,Need ENFJ thoughts on this: LOVE LETTER SENT BY ACCIDENT -  from INTJ female crushing on ENFJ male,"I am an INTJ female (took the test 3x) crushing on an ENFJ male (took test 1x) for 4 years now.

A little background on him: He's 2 years older than me. (I'm 27, he's 29). He got out of a 4-year relationship with his ex-gf 6 years ago. I met him 5 years ago as an acquaintance through a friend of a friend's party. We added each other up on facebook and we'd like each other's posts from time to time. His field and hobbies are more on the artistic side. He is in theater and acting. The first time I saw him, I thought he was one of the most good-looking guys I've ever seen. Neat, with good build. He was polite, gentlemanly, and neat. He has good people skills and had no trouble engaging people in a conversation. He has his group of friends and he exudes this aura of being a leader amongst them, I can't explain it. Yeah he's attractive but not usually the type I'd like because he just seemed like he has this barrier of caution around him, and that he was always careful and worried of what others thought about him; I don't know if it's insecurity but it did feel like it. I was more into guys who exuded that aura of certainty with a good balance of recklessness.

The more we interacted on occasional get-togethers, the more I started to get drawn to him and his quirks more. For instance, he'd crack a joke and no one would get it, but the fact that he would have this confused look that no one was laughing was adorable (well I thought so, but my face won't show it) (and yes, as an INTJ, I was one of those pricks who wouldn't laugh at his jokes simply because they weren't funny. But he'd shrug it off eventually and go back to being his cool self. But then minutes later, I'd remember his jokes and would get replayed in my mind unconsciously. Again, it's not the content I'm amused with, it was his attitude when no one was laughing). So after a few more months of occasionally interacting on FB and some more get-togethers, the more I realized that I may be crushing on him. So I asked our mutual friends more about him if he's, you know, available (INTJ investigating mode on). They said he was, but not looking for a relationship right now. My friends' theories were pretty much the same - he's still not over his ex even after 2 years has already passed since breaking up. It also confirmed my hunch because he was always posting these heartbroken, 'moving on' quotes on his FB from time to time. So after hearing these from our friends, I stopped myself from pursuing him because I don't want to get invested emotionally when I know there is no return of investment. I'd rather spend the time doing something productive in real-life. But the more I suppressed my feelings, the more he stayed in my mind, just clawing itself onto my brain for dear life.

So instead of letting the feelings bottle up inside, and since I was not the type to share my feelings openly to other people, I chose to write a REALLY long letter about my feelings for him. It was not meant to be sent, just an outlet for the overflowing feelings. But 3 years ago was when the interesting part happened. One of my friends was browsing on my phone when she found that letter. OH THAT STUPID LETTER. I have even forgotten I typed that one. I was doing my paper, and this friend had a little too much to drink, and the next thing I know, she muttered 'oops'. I looked at what the deal was about, and the next thing I knew...she just sent the freaking letter to his FB email, copied and pasted. I kid you not. Worst night ever. Think 'To All The Boys I've Ever Loved'. Never think it won't happen to you. Needless to say, I didn't talk to this friend for a day. But being an INTJ, I tried to rationalize the situation. And maybe I thought it was time that Enfj guy knew too. And part of me was glad that my friend did it. Maybe it was a beautiful accident? We still laugh about it from time to time though. But for the email, well I emailed ENFJ guy immediately after it happened and explained the situation. There was no reply. I took that 'no reply' as a sign that he's not interested. Finally, I could get on with my life and free up my emotional memory space for other prospective ""crushes"". Yes, only ""crushes"". I haven't had any boyfriends because I'm too busy with med school, so no time to go out and mingle for the purpose of dating. I did get asked out a few times in high school but again, busy with academic life, and simply because they didn't hold my interest.

I thought I finally got the closure I needed, but a few weeks after that, I noticed something weird about his FB posts. I didn't want to be complacent that he may be browsing through my page. Like on his past posts, he mentioned about being a health fanatic, like hitting the gym and avoiding carbs at all cost. But one morning, I posted about Krispy Kreme and a few hours later, he posted a box of Krispy Kreme. One time, I posted about these cute pic of golden retriever puppies on my feed, then a few days later, he posted a sweater with a puppy logo on it, one that he got from donating in a charity for animals. I also have a tendency to use certain phrases on my comments to other friends' posts  which he also started saying on his posts out of the blue. One time, I had to post a pic of me in my new white coat, then a few days later, he posted a pic of him wearing his brother's white coat (his brother works in an R&D lab). There was also a time when I posted about staying up all night to do a paper in neurosciences, then a few days later, he was wearing a jacket with a logo of the human mind. I also had this favorite meme that I posted, something about lecturing yourself in the mirror, and a few hours later, he also posted  meme with the same text content, but with different pic.

I don't know if I'm just seeing things the way I want to see them. And I would try to rationalize the situation by thinking these are just mere coincidences. Or just things that I just want to see from his actions. But there are times when I think that when such ""coincidences"" happen too often, are they still coincidences, or are they done on purpose? Note that we haven't talked since that 'letter' incident. I don't know if this is a passive-aggressive way of sending a message across or I'm just reading too much into it.

Question 1: What do ENFJs think about this? Is he doing it on purpose? Or I'm just reading too much into it? If he is doing it on purpose, I think it's a brutal way to play with my mind or tease me. Also, if indeed being done on purpose, what does it mean when Enfj does this? ( I know he's an ENFJ, Enfj-A to be exact since he posted it on his FB one time).

Question 2: I want to hit him up on FB messenger and ask him if he is doing it on purpose, in a nice joking way. Would it be a good idea to do? I don't have time for mind games and I don't want to assume. I want direct and straightforward. Would a direct approach seem the best way to do it?

Question 3: He still would post heartbroken quotes on FB, but not as frequent as before. Like once every 3 months. He also writes songs. He actually wrote 3 songs. 2 songs about being hurt from an ex-gf. 1 song about a dream girl he wants to approach, in this song he quoted some words from an FB post I made about the place I traveled to last year. (He may be one of the artsiest ENFJs that I know). It may sound like I'm full of myself but is it safe to assume that the latter song may be about me? Trust me, I tried to think that it's impossible to be me, because ENFJs are social people and there may also be another girl that he is trying to court or like. So I really don't know what to think. Is he still recovering from his previous wounds? What do ENFJs think about this action of his?

One of our mutual friends will be getting married next year. ENFJ guy is in the close circle of friends of our mutual friend so there's a huge possibility he'll be invited.

Question 4: I'm thinking of approaching him and flirting with him a bit during the oarty, and see how it would go from there. But I'm having second thoughts (overthinking Intj mode on) about doing this since it may turn out that I just thought too much about his FB posts, thinking they were about me. That he may not really be interested, to think that he hasn't sent a response for that Letter Accident 3 years ago. Would an ENFJ male get annoyed if I approach him? I know I'm asking a stupid question right now, but my INTJ mind has like 8 voices throwing their opinions left and right and my overthinking is just making me confused. (No, I don't have schizophrenia). Some may think I may be mistyped for having such urge for social initiatives like this (trust me I thought so too, but I already took the test 3x, and it came back as 'INTJ' (with 50-50 tendency for E/INTJ). Maybe because we're trained to face different people everyday as part of our med internship. So that might contribute too.

Question 5: Since our friend's wedding is too far away because of corona, is it okay if I send a friendly message to this Enfj male to just ask how he's doing during this Corona outbreak? Or would it scare him away or annoy him? He hasn't posted for 3 months now. Would it be okay to sound him out?

I don't know what to do and think anymore. I just want him to be prompt and forward about whether he likes me or not. Or maybe it's time for me to just forget about this guy and move on? I also like this last thought. Recently, I'm trying my best to forget him but this crush is going stronger every day that I even dreamt of him 2 nights in a row a few weeks ago, and last night. I realized I needed insights on my situation with this ENFJ guy. Right now, I'm doing the 'out of sight, out of my mind' approach. Would he notice if I block him on FB? Part of me thinks that he may be looking at my posts, and there's also the part that he may not be looking at my posts really and it's all just in my head. But if he is browsing thru my posts then I also want to send the message that I don't want to be played like that so I blocked him, which I did last week. Is this too much? Am I blowing up my chances with him? Or is this the smart thing to do?

All opinions are welcome and appreciated. Thanks!",https://www.personalitycafe.com//threads/need-enfj-thoughts-on-this-love-letter-sent-by-accident-from-intj-female-crushing-on-enfj-male.1351370/,,,,,,,,,,,
bmuddy120,"Vinsmoke Sanji (ENFJ) -  Why he's an Fe dom and not a Te user or Si user, One Piece MBTI","Sanji MBTI

Sanji ENFJ - Vinsmoke Sanji MBTI Type ENFJ

Sanji MBTI Type is ENFJ - One Piece MBTI Types

I decided to share my Vinsmoke Sanji ENFJ post here and clear up why he's a Fe dom and Ni user in my opinion and not a Te user or Si user at all. Feel free to share your opinions on it down below and tell me what you think.

Here's a One Piece Myers-Briggs Post on why Sanji is ENFJ in my opinion. He uses Fe and Ni and is ENFJ and I'll explain why I think so.

So I've noticed a lot of confusion with this character. Sanji is one of the most misunderstood characters in One Piece and I think this translates into MBTI as well. I've seen him in my opinion mistyped ESTJ and ESFJ, and I'm here to argue and explain my opinion on why Sanji is a clear ENFJ. Sanji is not a Te user but rather an Fe user and uses it all the time in the series. He definitely looks like an Si user on the surface but I believe most of that and his chivalry actually solely comes from his Fe mostly, and he's actually an Ni user if you look at him and pay attention to his character and actions in the story and series. Here's my argument for why Sanji is ENFJ.

Sanji is emotional and driven by his pride and belief system of chivalry and caring for women. He believes in treating women right and expects everyone on the planet to respect and treat all women properly and wants to meet their emotional needs. His beliefs are taught by Zeff and driven by his ideals that he grew up with and his personality. Sanji cares a lot about other peoples emotions and caring for the emotional state of women especially. He believes women should be treated right and is always serving them and wondering if people and women's emotional state are good and satisfied. He's very giving and he's always asking Nami or Robin are they ok and if they had enough food or drinks, do they need anything else, just ask and I'll get you everything you need, this is Fe, caring about the emotional state of others and reading their emotions and being in tune with them. Sanji has a societal expectation of respecting all women in the world and expects every man to do the same and if they don't and even worse hurt women in any situation he looks down on them and sees them as less than a man and person. We even see Sanji say this in the Arlong arc toward Korubi saying Luffy is a better person than you or the other fishman Arlong pirates cause at least he's not hurting a lady and forcing her to stay with them. Sanji is emotional, cries plenty of time, reads people's emotions, has hearts in his eyes, and is always caring for and asking about the emotional state of others constantly all the time in the series, some might say some of these points in this sentence are shallow simple stereotypes that doesn't fully prove Fe like crying and so on. And normally I would agree, in most cases that that's not enough I do agree on. Usopp is ENTP in my opinion and he's emotional as hell, but Sanji time and time again has proven to be emotional and feeding off of and reading peoples emotions in the series. And he has shown to want to serve other people and help them and their emotional state and to check how they're doing and desires to take care of them on a constant basis, especially for women! Sanji's Fe has been clear and obvious in my opinion, I'm surprised people mistake Te for him when its totally not there I feel, at least in his conscious main four functions. Sanji is not logical and doesn't care about Te efficiency and task orientation, he's structured, helps people stay on task and is organized but he's not logical and, to the point, and blunt task oriented like Te users are, he does it perfectly like Fe users, they're organized and stay on task too just in a emotional way. Sanji is always thinking of peoples emotions and is very kind and is always thinking about people's feelings and emotions and tries to reassure and make them feel better or is looking out for them and their emotions with his decision making in the series.

Most of Sanji's chivalry comes from his Fe, and I've come to understand this overtime. Examples of Sanji's Fe, the millions of times he asked Nami-san do you need anymore drinks? Are you feeling ok? Are you satisfied? I'll do anything for you, just ask and I'm there. He cooks for them and meets their emotional needs and lives to serve them and make them feel happy. Walking up to Vivi as Ms. Wednesday and offering his hand to help her up with his Fe manners. Sanji stopping Chopper and saying, you can't go after him, you need to understand how Usopp is feeling. Him putting his familys emotions and needs before his own and wanting to save them and thinking about them no matter how bad they treated him, this is typical Fe. Of course Fi user can want to help others and put other peoples needs over their own, but Fe is more known for it by definition in general. Sanji put his family's needs and lives over his own just like an Fe user would and ENFJ would do in that situation, his panel of him crying while saying that and admitting this too Luffy showcased that and all the Fe in Sanji. Sanji says imagine how miserable it would make Usopp feel if Chopper ran off and pitied him to treat him after losing a serious duel that he started against Luffy. Sanji is focused on Usopp's emotional state and is thinking ahead on how he would feel if Chopper treated him right after the fight, this is pure Fe in Sanji not Te at all. Sanji is focused on Usopp's suffering and emotional state in that scene as he says to Chopper himself, this scene is a major moment of Fe for Sanji in the series. Sanji helping Duval and fixing his face when he didn't need too was another Fe moment and helpful thing he did without asking, he also does this when he puts needs of his crew and protects them by going with Bege to Big Mom, and so on with other examples. Sanji also does things for random people and helps no matter who they are, like Gin as a famous example and countless other times in the story, which is typical Fe, and the Gin example also reinforces his Fe of nobody should go hungry and I need to make sure they feel good and happy if they're starving in front of me, he even says ?údamn good right!???and Gin cries and says yeah and tells him he?ôs greatful and so on again showing in Sanji he cares about the persons emotional state and if Gin down to his stomach and heart feels happy and relieved he?ôs eating and alive after near death starvation experience he just had, this is major Fe coming out with Sanji here with this line he says and caring about if it tastes and if Gin feels good after starving for so long without good food to eat or anything eat or drink for that matter. Sanji not deciding to hit Kalifa because of his chivalry again was Fe. Sanji is not an Fi user, his values don't come from within but instead is directed outwards and is focused on society and his view and values of how other people should be when treating women and he again believes all people and men should treat women with respect and emotionally good and well, its a society based expectation Sanji believes in, this is all Fe in Sanji coming out again. Sanji being indebted to Zeff was Fe again and not wanting to leave to repay him. He didn't judge and cared for Pudding and her emotions and compliments her eye even after finding out the truth about her and after everything that happened, Fe again in Sanji. The list goes on. I used to type Sanji ESFJ at once point cause I thought he used clear Fe along with Si to shape him. And I fully understand this typing and concept trust me, Sanji definitely looks like an Si user on the surface and you could argue some of these examples are Si, I fully understand But I think most if not all these examples are Fe and Sanji isn't an Si user at all even if he looks like one at times. And here's why he's isn't one.

I'm going to explain why Sanji is an Ni user now since I feel I drove my point home with Fe above. Sanji is intuitive and we see several examples of this in the story. Sanji tells Zoro after smoking his cigarette and blowing smoke in the air that do you really believe Nami was telling the truth right then? And then he proceeds to tell him why he thinks this, Sanji is insightful and sees things behind the scenes and is always looking at the bigger picture and what's actually going on behind the surface with things and making connections, this is Ni in Sanji coming out. Sanji is future oriented and idealistic and is always thinking ahead like an Ni user would and in that style. Sanji uses his Ni again when he answers the phone in little garden and immediately says this is the damn restaurant may I take your order, he doesn't give his name or indicate he's a pirate to let the other person on the phone he might be someone else or suspicious even when Sanji has idea who it is on the phone. Eventually he finds out who's on the phone and fools Crocodile that their dead and planned ahead here and made him stop chasing them, Ni in Sanji. Sanji uses Ni once again when he made that whole plan with Mr. Prince to trick Crocodile and make him come outside and think he was captured another major Ni moment for Sanji. He does this once again in Enies Lobby with his plan, Si users are great planners to and strategist but they plan differently based on past experiences and what worked in the past and what's most secure to them based on what their Si knows and picks up on in a situation, Sanji does not do this. He always one step ahead of everyone and is planning ahead and is very future oriented with his thinking and the plans he comes up with. His Ni planning comes up constantly in the series, the flying fish riders is another example to bring up but I'll be here all day if I mention them all so here's all the major Ni moments I'll mention here before for Sanji and why he's a clear intuitive and Ni users. Like I said Sanji is always reading the situation and seeing behind the scenes with his Ni as well, he tells Chopper in Water 7 don't believe a lady when she was lying and always forgive her, showing again just like with Nami he sees behind Robin with his Ni and Fe too I'll mention and doesn't for a second believe or doubt Robin despite her act she gave and knows there's something more going on with Robin no matter how believe Robin looked when she rejected them earlier, all Ni moments in Sanji. Sanji is very intuitive and this all explains why and his Ni in the series.

Sanji is also very idealist and a huge dreamer. Everyone on the ship has dreams and intuitives and NFs aren't the only dreamers in the world with big crazy ambitions and goals. But NFs are more known for it and being the biggest dreamers among the temperaments. And Sanji's dream is one of the most idealistic among the bunch. His All Blue dream fits perfectly with him being an NF and ENFJ. Zeff has the same All Blue dream too and I type him ESTJ but he's simply a practical sensor SJ man with an idealistic dream and he has Ne too. Sanji's dreamer side comes out more from his Ni coupled with his Fe to make him idealistic and Sanji is obviously seen as the more idealistic and emotional one of the two since Sanji's face lights up like we saw in the East Blue Saga during the Baratie arc when Zeff looked at him and saw how happy he looked, Zeff believes in the dream and gets happy upon thinking of it but he's not as idealistic as Sanji and his face doesn't like up just like Sanji's does when the All Blue comes up with his childlike, happy innocent smile he gave in the arc which is more of an NF trait more than anyone else. Sanji is also always seen daydreaming and idolizing things in his head, he dreams about women and mermaids and wants to go to fishman island to see the mermaids early on in the series and it comes up over and over again in his mind and through characters telling him more as the series progresses. The amount of times Sanji idealizes Robin and Nami in his head is too many to count, and he dreams of mermaids all the time constantly in the series. Also Sanji is shown living in the moment fairly well plenty of times and focusing on the task at hand and reacting to and taking in details around him when he's not using his Ni to be future oriented and insightful. And his inferior Ti is clear when he does stupid illogical things at times and gives into his Fe chivalry over logical inconsistency and what logically makes sense in a situation, we see this behavior when he doesn't touch Caulifa once when he should in this situation and his chivalry doesnt matter as much when Robin is about to be taken away and he needs to think logically here and get the key no matter what for the greater cause to save her, but his Fe society chivalry values get in the way anyway and then Nami hits him and calls him stupid for it. He also shows this illogical stupidity when he lets himself get a nosebleed on Fishman Island and almost dies, he also gave into his tertiary Se by living in the moment and focused on the pleasure he was feeling. He also does this again similarly when he gets perverted and throws himself at women even if they're bad and obviously an evil shady woman trying to deceive him, showing low Ti with him not being logical and noticing inconsistencies with bad women and trying to see their true intentions. He does plenty of times and did this similarly with Viola when he gave into his idealism and romantic and idealistic loving nature which is an NF stereotype even if all types have idealism in them. Sanji consistently let's his emotions and Fe take over and fails to look at obvious situations logically when he's infatuated and completely misses things and the truth and logical details he should be seeing if he just tried to stop being emotional all the time and holds back his affection for women which is very hard for Sanji to do as we've seen time and time again. That's why I definitely see Sanji as an ENFJ, hope you enjoyed reading and share your opinions down below. If your curious I type Luffy ENFP and will do another post on him soon since my old post, I type Zoro ISTP, Nami ESFJ, Robin INTJ, Franky ESTP, Chopper INFP, Brook ESFP and so on. You can read more about that hear and my thoughts:

ENFJconfusion,Mixed signals from ENFJ!,"I've known this ENFJ for a little over a year and when we met we were both in relationships at the time (she's a bi female and I'm lesbian), so we got to know each other in general and we both realized we had an attraction for each other, but it wasn't appropriate to pursue. Both our relationships were kinda circling the drain at the time and we both broke up with our significant others (not having to do with our attraction toward each other) She rebounded with some guy right after her relationship and I spent months just trying to process my relationship coming to an end plus I let my ex stay with me so she can get on her feet financially for a few months. Well she saw indirectly that my ex had moved out of my house and sent me a DM saying how much she missed me and would love to hang out.  I told her I'd like that and a few days later I text her and asked her if she was free that weekend.  She happily agreed and we met up to catch up.  The first thing she asked when I got there was if my ex was indeed gone and I'm single.  I confirmed and asked how things were going with her rebound guy and she downplayed saying how it wasn't a serious situation and that it's over and not seeing him anymore.  We both said how we're not looking for anything serious because we both just got out of serious relationships somewhat recently and just not in that head space. We had a few drinks and called it a night. I reached out a few days later and asked her out on a date and she happily agreed. We went out and had a great time. We were kissing at the end of the date and she mentioned about wanting to get physical with me (she had code red so she couldnt that night) so I asked her when she'd be in the clear and we made another date at my place. We had our next date and the chemistry was amazing in and out of the bedroom, then another date and another.  I text about once a week to set up dates and am responsive to the here and there texts she would send in between (she didn't text me much) she started giving me a call here and there and when I'd pick up the phone and say ""Hey, what's up?"" she always says ""I just was calling to see how you're doing. I wanted to hear your voice"" or ""I wanted to hear your voice, I miss you"" I thought everything was going along fine. She took a trip out of state with her friends for a week and as soon as she got back into town she gave me a call and she said I just got back from Chicago, I said ""Oh I didn't know you went to Chicago"" she said ""You didn't notice I was gone for a week!"" she seemed quite offended. That was a misunderstanding so I replied with ""No, I knew you were out of town but you didn't tell me you where. I didn't know you were going to Chicago"" so we talked for a little bit and then she said how she wanted to make to get a COVID test because she was out of town and so she was gonna quarantine until she got the test back. Well, we havent seen each other for a week, and now its another week before she finds that out. So her next text was 5 days later telling me she was COVID free, but now she has her period again. I told her to let me know when she's free because I'd love to see her. She says she hopes it's gone by the weekend because she would love to see me. I text her a few days later asking her if she'd like to come by my place the upcoming Sunday. Her texts were not nearly as fast but she did respond saying ""Absolutely what time?"" I tell her 8pm and she says she's hoping it was 5am and asks if I can tell that she misses me.  I said I can cancel the date part if you wanna get straight to it and she says ""wonderful "" I then tell her she can come over from 5am to 5am (meaning a whole day) and said ""Can you tell I miss you?"" she says ""I would hope you miss me! Its been so long"" then I said we'll have to make up for lost time and she sent me a heart.
Sunday comes and 4 hours before we're supposed to finally see each other she writes ""Hey love, I woke up not feeling all that great mentally, My depression and anxiety is kinda all over the place this weekend and I'm not entirely sure why. I may just see how I feel in a bit but I wanted to at least let you know in case I'm not feeling it."" I said I'm sorry she's feeling anxious and depressed and that I'd love to see her but I understand and asked if she wanted to reschedule.  She 2 hours to respond and said yes, and apologized and then apologized more and said she really misses  me and was looking forward to seeing me and asked if she could call me the next day. Each text was really spaced out though, which is unusual. She called me the next morning just with a tail between her legs type of vibe apologizing and she said she's bummed she didn't get to see me and that she misses me. She pain in her chest all night just anxious and couldn't sleep and that she tried to exercise and eat healthy and pep herself up so she could come by but nothing worked. She said she has to go back to Chicago for a family thing and she'll be gone ANOTHER week and we talked for a bit and we hung up. Then I tried to call her a few hours later to see if I could see her before she leaves town. It went to voice mail (also unusual) SIX hours later she text me asking if I meant to call her and she's sorry but she just saw the missed call. The girl has an Apple watch on her wrist and a cell phone and a computer that's synced lol, she's missing nothing for 6 hours.  So the next morning I text her back and said ""I did "" she said she'll call me when she gets on the road to the airport.  She calls me like 10 minutes later and first thing was more apologies and said she was packing all night and that she even went to bed early etc.. explaining without me asking for explanation. She asks why I called and I said ""It's kind of a moot point now"" then started to laugh.  She said ""Why were you gonna ask me out somewhere?!"" I said ""Yeah, I wanted to see you before you left again. I didn't realize you were leaving so soon though""  I also said I didn't want to leave any room for miscommunication and that I miss her and I do wanna see her. She said ""Aww that's so sweet, I wanna see you as soon as my plane lands"" (it sounded like it lacked emotion though) and so I just joked back with ""You'd better come straight here!"" and then she said she hopes I have a good week while shes gone and I said I hope she has safe travels.
I checked her social media and there was a post saying (and I'm paraphrasing here) You can't have love until you can have self love. One said You can pressure someone into doing what you want them to do, or you could take the pressure off and see what they'd rather do. Dont force them to do what they don't want to.  I can't tell if I gave her a wrong vibe or if this is about someone else or what the deal is.  Would an ENFJ call and say how much they wanna see you and miss you if they were no longer feeling it?  How should I proceed?",https://www.personalitycafe.com//threads/mixed-signals-from-enfj.1351187/,,,,,,,,,,,
Posie_girl90,Inspire me!

Will you share them with me?",https://www.personalitycafe.com//threads/inspire-me-maybe-the-world-to-who-knows.1350921/,,,,,,,,,,,
Zerobot,I find myself in a predicament with an ENFJ.,"So, I decided to open a new discussion here on the forum motivated by recent events with an ENFJ girl, the kind of thing that bugs an INTJ's mind and I can't help to seek some perspectives if you will.

Here's the narrative:
Let's say that I met this ENFJ about five months ago on a dating app,  we texted a lot before the first date, she told me about her past experiences and breakups, among other stuff. I felt a connection and I thought she did too. Anyways, we had a first date and we went all the way, physically speaking, then we had a couple of other dates. Right after that, she told me that her last breakup was not that long ago and she was still processing it, looking to meet new people and casual relationships, that she was too hurt and gave up on the idea of romantic love. She was also trying to rebuild herself, be more independent. To it, I said I do look for a substantial relationship, that I enjoy romance, and I couldn't be physical with her because to me sex would lead to romantic feelings, but I quite enjoyed her company, so we could be platonic friends, respecting each other limits, but still enjoying our conversations and hanging out. It didn't happen, we saw each other one more time, sexually. Ok. 
Then the quarantine started. 
We continued to talk a lot through text, some voice recording, we went like that for quite some time, sharing deeper thoughts and our daily lives, showing some work we did while in-home, discussing ideas, that sort of stuff. Oh, and flirting, that too. I thought we were indeed getting closer, even if the circumstances weren't ideal at all and she didn't want to make any calls because of privacy - we're both gay, she isn't out and lives with her mom, I could get that. Then, suddenly, she withdraws - a bit after the third month we met, right after she gives up last-minute time on a call she said she would make with me. Well, I was developing romantic feelings for her, I knew that, so I noticed the withdraw and felt a bit pained by it all, but I thought not only I was being unreasonable, not only because we didn't know each other for long, not only because we both developed a lot of this whole thing online, but also because she said she wasn't looking for this kind of relationship. Until she started to noticeably ignore me. Well, I'm an anxious person with no real ability in dealing with people, so I thought to myself the best I could do for me was to understand the situation and be honest with her. So I asked her why she withdrew and how we should proceed. I also decided to tell her about my feelings about it all, rather bluntly perhaps. I guess she felt attacked and withdrew even more, eventually, after some pushing on my part, she told me I had a wrong impression of her, that I only saw the good side of her, that she knew the quarantine made things intense and a bit symbiotic, that I should focus on me and develop myself (WTF?), and, finally, that she had changed her perception of me, that it hurts her to cut all contact, but I was asking way more than she could give. Well, I confess it ignited my anxiety. 
You see, I never intended to push more than she could give, I understood that she wasn't interested in romanticism. I told her about my feelings because, well, I thought she should know why it hurt that she was pushing me off, why I was asking for clarification since it didn't feel too casual for me, and that I was worried about her, especially in this isolation period, but I certainly could deal with my inappropriate feelings. I did know it was quite a rebound situation for her, I wasn't judging her or anything, I can handle the truths, so it felt a lot like a projection on her part to presume I was pushing for more. We're not talking anymore, after she, in my last push towards the truth, told I was not being respectful towards her and she wondered if we could be friends. But I still wonder: 

1. How ENFJs deal with breakups? How do they feel about a rebound?
2. What would make an ENFJ change its mind about a person in this situation and withdraw?
3. Why would she be so offended because I asked direct questions or ignore so completely my feelings?
4. Whatever insight you might have on the situation at hand, ha.",https://www.personalitycafe.com//threads/i-find-myself-in-a-predicament-with-an-enfj.1350511/,,,,,,,,,,,

Berns321,Beggining of relationship INFP&ENFJ,"Hello! I've been sort of a stalker on these forums for a while, but now that I have somewhat of a situation I'm needing advice about I've finally decided to make my own profile!

There is a guy I just started dating (ENFJ) He is a really sweet dude. But the way our relationship has been developing, and how I feel about him is just a little off...

I liked him as soon as I met him, and I'm pretty sure he felt the same way. We starting going out soon after...things went pretty fast. Which I know is kinda of against the way I'd ideally like to happen, but you know we both knew we liked each other right away, we just kind of cut to the chase =/ So I started seeing him almost every day for couple weeks, but it just felt that something was amiss...maybe because it all happened to fast (this is both of our first relationship). It felt like we were trying to hard to hard to fit that cookie cutter image of a couple, like we were forcing ourselves to be something we are not, to the point were I didn't really know how I was supposed to feel about him. So I talked to him about it one day at the beach, and I think I freaked him out because he broke up with me that night...
For a week we didn't see each other, and then on facebook we starting chatting and we both found out we missed each other waaay more than we thought we would (I really did miss him). So we decided to give it another go.

Our first date since then was yesterday.....

My big question is....how am I supposed to feel? I miss him a lot when he isn't here...but when we are together I feel kind of uneasy, and the conversation doesn't flow as well as I would like it to...He ends up talking A LOT about his family, friends, and events that happened to him. I like to listen, I do...but I wish we could talk about things more important to me...I get so nervous about what to do and say around him...I want to let these walls come down, and talk about more vulnerable things, but I get the feeling he wouldn't be into that, but as an infp, i think I really need those conversations, and deep connection.

SophiCandel,Why are ENFJ girls ignored by every boy?,"Hi everyone, as you can see I am not talking about myself. It's about this very good friend of mine. And I also know that generalizing my friend's problem into a type-wide scale is a logical fallacy, but I am only doing it for argument's sake. If there are other ENFJ girls and women who have noticed this about their social-personal life, please share your insight with me. Otherwise I promise I will change the title, or delete the thread or something.

And for the practical aspect of the problem, she's beautiful. Not merely hot (which she is) but beautiful. Blonde hair, natural highlights, blue eyes, architecturally great face. Now WHY is she getting only rejections from every boy she sets her eyes on, AND everyone she doesn't. I mean from each and every one of them she has gotten the phrase: She's beautiful but I would NEVER do anything with her. You can imagine how hurtful it feels.

Emancipation,Do you change your voice?,"I have a horrible habit of regularly change my voice. I've been doing it since I was a teen and at this point in my life, I genuinely don't have the slightest clue what my natural, unaffected voice sounds like. Even when I speak 100% relaxed, I don't feel I sound 100% authentic.

When I was younger I was into Old Hollywood and intentionally tried to sound more breathy, classy and sensual (sort of like Joan Crawford) but then when people in English class (I'm Croatian) told me I have a British accent that makes it seem like I'm trying to sound smarter than them, I tried to make it more American. 

Then when I got into singing, I noticed that a lot of great singers speak in the lowest part of their range (Beyonce sometimes hits B2 when she speaks, Ariana sometimes D3 which is lower than she ever sung lol) so I tried to speak as low as possible without sounding overly manly. I wasn't lowering my larynx or pushing my voice at all, but people still told me it sounds very deep and manly so I became self conscious about it and started making it higher.

I always wanted people to find my voice attractive and pleasant (and I DID occasionally get compliments for it - so I'm not a complete flop), but I feel I just made a mess out of my voice. :sad:",https://www.personalitycafe.com//threads/do-you-change-your-voice.1301477/,,,,,,,,,,,
mkdubs,ENFJ male with an ESFP female.,"I've done the test plenty of times. I finally convinced my girlfriend (of 3+ years) to do it. 
She is a ESFP. Everything appears to say we are doomed. In fact it almost appears that since we only see each other 1 or 2 a month, that is why we have stayed together so long. 

The only real info I found on us together was from this site. 

soniocs webpage (i apparenlty can't post links)
But IT says I'm the benefactor to her (she is the beneficiary) it describes our relationship on this page


Our relationship is as follows




			These are relations of mutual respect between partners. Super-Ego partners may think of each other as a distant and slightly mysterious ideal. They often show interest in each other's manners, behaviour and thought composition. Both partners experience a warm feeling towards each other, but for the outsider, these relations may look cold. 

If Super-Ego partners cannot find common interests, their interaction can become very formal. Partners normally think more about expressing their own point of view than listening to their partner. This expression comes from the confident side of one of the partners reaching the unconfident side of the other partner. The latter tries to defend themselves by projecting their confident points in return. Partners normally show interest and respect to each other if they do not know each other well enough. When partners start more close interaction, they start experiencing many problems. 

Super-Ego partners may think that they understand each other well. However, when it comes to day to day matters or co-operative activity, partners start thinking that their partner is deliberately trying to do everything wrong. Super-Ego partners are not interested and do not make each other aware of their intentions. Therefore their actions may look exactly opposite to what was expected. Although the hope and the feeling between partners may remain as before, it does not prevent the conflicts penetrating their relationship. 

When both partners are extroverts  one of them usually feels more unsatisfied with their position. The explanation for this is that they believe that the other partner does not pay as much attention to them as they should and are too occupied with their own matters.

leviosa,INTJ - ENFJ relationship struggles,"Hi ENFJs, INTJ here and I need help.

I am a 30yo female in a relationship with a 25yo ENFJ female. We have been dating for over a year, planning to get married in 8 months, and everything has been great so far until now.

About a month ago, I was feeling down, and when that happens I shut down. I didn't communicate my feelings to her, and when I did it was by text and in a very poor and unfair way.

Now she has told me that she loves me but that she's thinking about leaving the relationship.

Leaving this past month aside, she's told me that she doesn't feel needed and that I never talk to her about what's going on with me, that she needs to feel that she's the person I go to with my problems. As an example, she was mentioning that everyday when she asks how was my day or how was work, my answer is just ""it was okay"". From what she said I understand that she needs me to tell her things in more detail, what happened to me and what frustrated me and why, etc. The thing is I don't need to talk about things like that. When I leave work I just want to forget about it and be home and spend time with her without having to talk about what bothers me on situations that are completely unrelated to her. I just want to enjoy her company.

I know I have a problem when it comes to talk about my feelings and I have issues with showing myself vulnerable around others. I have told her that, and I have made an appointment with a therapist because improving myself that way will improve my life and our relationship. She was upset, because she said that for this she should also be the person I go to, and not a therapist. 

It blew my mind when she said that she doesn't feel needed. Because I do need her. My life has improved very significantly since I met her, and she's my fucking everything. I'm frustrated for not being able to show her that. I've told her but she says that the problem is that she doesn't feel it. I ask her what I can do so that she feels it, but she doesn't know.

LemonYeti,"Type Confusion, ENFJ 8?","Hey all,

I find myself in a weird position and I'm wondering if anyone can relate or can offer insight to help clear up my confusion.  

In essence, I've been into MBTI almost a decade now, since high school, but due to a rough couple years after graduating college and living independently, I've come to question a lot of things about myself.  

I've most often gotten ENFJ as my test results, which I strongly identified with, though I got many others that also I identified with, including ISTP, and I more or less embraced the fluidity.  Now I know ENFJ's supposedly have a hard time seeing themselves objectively and have the same functions as ISTP's just reversed in the stack, which indicates ENFJ to me, but they're also rarely type 8 on the enneagram which makes me skeptical.  I started learning about the enneagram about two years ago and I'm all but certain I'm type 8w9, with the only real other consideration being type 9w8; they supposedly imagine themselves being more 8.  And statistically speaking, types 8 and 9 are far more strongly correlated to ISTP with ISTP also being far more common than ENFJ.  I'm not comfortable claiming to be some rare type.

Anyway, I won't go into detail here about ""my deal"". I've made another post on PerC that I edited down because it pages long, literally filled journals, talked (big step for me) to friends, family, a therapist, and done so much soul-searching stuff that I've found myself obsessive, obnoxious, and obviously still very confused about who I am.  Suffice it say, I'm at least good at compartmentalizing, adapting, work, and being self-sufficient.

But what is healthy for me?  Emotionally/mentally, I'm not entirely sure what my strengths and weaknesses are, so it's tough to narrow things down and figure it out.  I'm sensitive to other people but honestly pretty callous and have good intution, Se, and Ti. It's like I've a very broad, general, kind of vague identity, that's also well-balanced between ENFJ and ISTP.  I'm probably just very average, but that's why it's weird to read all this stuff for ENFJ 2's or ISTP 5's.  I connect with some things but not much.  I feel like a jack of all trades, master of none.

Anyone else an ENFJ 8?  Got any insights?  Am I just overthinking all of this? I'll post in the ISTP forum too eventually, but the vibe seems much more subdued and like I wouldn't get the same kind of feedback.

Dr Whoresy,Questions for the ENFJs!,"Hi! I just have some questions, as I'm trying to clarify my type...I know most people may just skip past all these questions, but even answering a few helps! Thank you!

1. Are you a type 2 Enneagram? If so, are you a 2w3?

2. What tritype are you?

3. What is your socionics type? What are your primary and secondary romance styles according to the socionics test?

4. According to a cognitive functions test, put your 8 functions in order from greatest to least

5. What is your attitudinal psyche type?

6. What is your temperament (the two highest are your temperament)?

7. What is your 5x5 alignment test results?

8. Can you tell when someone is being fake to get something out of you? For example: I was at the archery range shooting my bow when I ended up talking to a stranger there. We were talking and he asked me if I had ever been hunting. Said no, I had no idea how...he started using my first name a lot and began saying how he'd totally teach me if I had a place for us to hunt. Now, I'm no idiot. I knew very clearly that he didn't give a shit about teaching me to hunt, he just wanted a place to hunt and probably had no real interest in teaching me. I took his number out of politeness and told him I'd text him if I found somewhere. I had no intention of ever texting him. When people start saying my first name a lot (when it's clear they're talking to me and they're total strangers to me), any trust I had for them instantly goes out the window...it's something pulled straight out of the car salesman handbook and is an instant sign, at least in my eyes, that they're not being genuine. If it's someone I know, that's a lot different.

9. Do you ever have a thought cross your mind regarding a subject, agree with it, then 2 seconds later, realize how immoral it is and realize you don't agree with it? This could be regarding the death penalty, punishments for abhorrent crimes, etc. For example: You hear something about a rapist and think to yourself ""We should kill all rapists""...then a second later realize ""Hey...that's not okay at all, they deserve the right to a fair trial like everyone else.""

10. What other types have you tested as?

11. How turbulent are you?

12. Do you ever give unsolicited advice regarding everyday things to people...I.E if you're bowling and you see something a friend could improve, you tell them.

13. Do you give unsolicited life and emotional advice to close friends when they're going through a tough time?

14. Are you the type of person to tell someone going through a rough time that ""Things will be better one day soon."" and give them hope for the future?

15. Do you tell people you love that you love them at least once a day, sometimes more than once a day?

16. Do you ever get so overcome with feelings of affection and emotions while talking to your partner, that you simply say their name and then tell them how much you love them...even if it's totally out of the blue.

17. Do people often ask you, dumbfounded, how you jumped from one topic you were talking about to another one that is completely unrelated

18. Have you ever been told you have no common sense? Ever been told you have so much potential? 

19. Are you always early or on time to obligations?

20. Do you like making large groups of people (40+) laugh?

21. Ever considered doing standup comedy

22. Is the feeling of social rejection very hard, if not the hardest thing  for you to handle?

23. Do you take way more awful shit from people than you should?

24. Do you think there is ever a situation where you could beat the shit out of someone? Whether it be protecting your children, your spouse, your best friend, a loved one?

25. Were you the ""weird kid"" when you were younger?

26. Do you have ADHD?

27. How quickly does your mood change everyday

28. On a scale of 1-10, how much do you wish you could dance good/play an instrument/sing?",https://www.personalitycafe.com//threads/questions-for-the-enfjs.1315021/,,,,,,,,,,,
lydibug,I finally met an ENFJ male! cant stop thinking now...insights appreciated!,"Hi everyone 

This amazing ENFJ is the facilitator of a personal development type class I'm taking. (MBTI is part of the class so I actually got confirmation he is an ENFJ!) I hardly know the guy of course, but intuitively I just felt like...it's so hard to put into words even! The first time our eyes met...I was left wondering what the frilly heck just happened?! This was before he even spoke! Not in a romantic starry eyed way, but I just felt some kind of connection in a way I have not experienced before. (Ive had plenty of crushes and relationships)

 It even seems at times we can communicate so much to each other through our eyes (while he is talking at the front to the group)...it almost feels weirdly telepathic at times. (one time he said something like ""don't forget people can't read your mind""...but then he paused and said in a quieter tone '""or who knows, maybe they can ha"" and kind of half glanced in my direction with a shy smile (maybe I imagined it being directed at me...but it seemed sort of out context to add that in otherwise )

So it has been just over a week since the class started...he really has this way of drawing me out and making me feel less self-conscious. I am even spontaneously laughing any time I find something funny and am one of the most talkative in the group even though I'm usually silent unless directly asked a question. This is so weird for me. I like this new version, but it's weird haha It's so great being around him! 

And even though I'm happily single right now (not looking in the least)....I found myself secretly wishing and hoping that he is single so there might be an opportunity to get to know him better once the class is over (in 4 weeks) and see what happens because so far we seem to be so naturally in-tune and ""get"" each other...I think the ENFJ-INFP do seem to compliment each other so well...now I know what I've been missing out on all this time! 

Problem is...he's not single. 

He mentioned his girlfriend very casually a few times during anecdotes or whatever (they live together and have a dog is all I know)

BUT before I say anything else, I want to be clear that  I'm not looking for advice on how to steal him from his girlfriend or how to get him to like me. If someone is taken, they are off-limits in my mind and I've always been able to just accept that we aren't meant to be obviously and let it go. Well...except this time? Please don't judge...but I'm sort of now secretly hoping that maybe his girlfriend and him have been having problems for a long time and are on the verge of breaking it off. I can't help it. 

Here's the thing...I've been reading about ENFJ and how they are friendly and attentive to everyone naturally which can come across as romantic interest even when not intended. So I was fine with that, thinking that's probably all that's going on here...but there are just a few examples that leave me wondering...and I'd feel better if you can give your best guess on if you feel this could be feelings developing on his part or just him being exceptionally good at what he does (making people feel good about themselves) and I'm looking a little too hard for comfirmation...lol

-When he is talking in front of the group, I noticed that he is looking at me a lot of the time ( he looks around the room but then his eyes seem to come back to me anytime he pauses) and we often lock eyes and exchange smiles (could be just that I am so smiley and receptive when it comes to him? lol I dunno
-When he is not up front teaching and we are near each other he becomes a lot more shy, he'll smile at me but it's more of a goofy grin and he can't seem to make direct eye contact while talking and seems to fumble over his words but is not that way with the others in the group. One time he was standing around talking to a couple others in the group so I walked over to join in the conversation and he got really quiet
-when he is sitting next to me during group activities, I ""feel""something...I dunno what...he doesn't talk to me, but I feel some vibe from him that he is interested. Maybe it's all in my head gah. 
-he seems to be tailoring his personal examples around things he knows interest me. Ie)the day after he found out I have kids and mentioned running late for art class, he mentioned on the weekend how he talked to his 7 year old nephew on the phone and was going on about their conversation and then later mentioned he had been to see his friend's art exhibit over the weekend as well. (this is just 1 example of how he seems to do this because and I don't notice him doing it with others)
-see him looking at me often through my peripheral vision when we're working independently (I think but I am so prone to blushing, I'm too afraid to try to catch him to confirm lol) But maybe this doesn't mean anything either? maybe he's just observing me?


Sorry for the ramble...I guess what I really want to know is do you think this could be interest and if it is do you think that means he feels the way I do which means his relationship must be going badly because he seems like the type that would be fiercly loyal? This is ideal scenario for me and I'm plenty patient...I am not saying I want to date him anytime soon...just that the potential is there. But if he is in a happy relationship and/or is not interested I want to be able to just let this go. And I think I can once I know. 

Is there something I can say or do that is appropriate in this scenario (classroom) to get clearer confirmation one way or the other so I can stop this thinking and analyzing everything?",https://www.personalitycafe.com//threads/i-finally-met-an-enfj-male-cant-stop-thinking-now-insights-appreciated.116697/,,,,,,,,,,,

rex88,The Anxiety Handshake... is he nervous?,"There is this guy that we both had a liking towards each other about 5 years ago, things went downhill because he was not ready for commitment and other complications - however I have always been in love with him.

I saw him with a bunch of friends at a bar last week and being the tipsy confident me I went up to him and said hello. I went too shake hands with him and he was so nervous I think because he shook my hand very soft and gently. He said he did not recognise me but looked really glad to see me and said that he remembers me back 5 years ago, we continued to chat, he cracked some humour here and there (also laughed at my jokes too). I also noticed he spoke quite deep and loudly, smiled a lot, his eyes were lit up/all big and was looking directly at my face when I was talking to him. 

After about 5 mins we had to part ways and when I said goodbye I put out my hand to shake hands; he grabbed my hand and he shook very soft and gentle. Then I texted him straight afterwards and told him that it was nice to see him and to have a nice evening; he messaged me back saying ""Nice to see you too"" (he's always been a robotic text messager, dry and straight to the point mind you).

74893H,What have your interactions been like with INFPs?,"Hey ENFJs, hi, hello, hope you don't mind me scootin' into your turf.

The reason I ask is because AFAIK I've only ever properly interacted with one ENFJ and I clicked with that person on a level I've never experienced with anyone else in my life, just immediately I opened up to them with all my thoughts and all my feels and they did the same with me, and I don't think I've ever had that kind of relationship with anyone before, I'm usually really reserved and private. They seemed to lean on me in particular as a kind of moral support for the short while I knew them and that was like whoah. Affection is nice.

I've done some thinking on the whole thing and while I'm not a fan of saying X type is/isn't compatible with Y type because it varies from person to person, I think there is good reason to suggest that INFPs and ENFJs are very compatible as people, mostly because of that INFP desire to be understood combined with that ENFJ desire to better understand others, and I'm wondering if I'm right about that from the ENFJ perspective, and if you've had that same kind of dynamic with INFPs in the past.

Do you guys have any specific examples of INFPs you've met in your life and how your interactions have been with them, to support/refute this idea? If I'm wrong and there's no pattern that's totally okay, I think you guys are great regardless. And of course it'll still vary from person to person, but I'm curious as to whether there's a pattern.",https://www.personalitycafe.com//threads/what-have-your-interactions-been-like-with-infps.1309917/,,,,,,,,,,,
JungianWhiteGuy,Tale of epic ENFJ romance gone wrong,"Hello! I?ôm an ENF(T)P. I was in a relationship with an ENFJ, and I?ôm writing for therapeutic purposes and perhaps to mine some wisdom from NFs. My story begins with an encounter with a beautiful girl with a huge heart and a lot to offer. We loved each other deeply and were wrapped up into each other like a magical cocoon of energetic bliss. I could share some of the crazy gushed out poetry and love notes we shared with each other, but I?ôll spare you. 

We moved in together and things went terribly wrong within a week. The week prior to the move in we were still in love with no sign of pending troubles. The situation is unbelievably complex in some ways and unbelievably simple in others. It?ôs my tendency to assume the entirety of the blame for the failure of my relationships, but I?ôm coming to realize that we created that relationship together and the blame is shared. 

The simple explanation of what went wrong is that when relationships become more committed, the fire burns more dimly. I felt I could relax, became more boyish, and became complacent in truly connecting with her. This, I?ôm coming to realize was an unconscious test to see if she loved my inner child, but it?ôs no doubt a form of immaturity that needs to be weeded out like cancer. Because no one loves a man who hasn?ôt tamed the inner child, nor should they. No need to elaborate on her faults and shortcomings, since they were outside my domain of control. However, It?ôs worth saying that it?ôs the idea/symbol of numinous perfection at the basis of our cognitive structures that plagued both of us. No human is perfect and if you believe they are deep down, then this inner belief prevents true human love. I believe we both overestimated each other in this way. 

The more complicated explanation is that she felt homesick. She was away from her family, familiar territory, ecosystem of friends, and I became her entire ecosystem. I had friends to introduce her to and she had a job lined up but a week wasn?ôt enough time to make the transition.  This created anxiety in her when we had the smallest of disagreements. The new ecosystem, me, couldn?ôt provide her the same feelings of safety, comfort and masculine love couldn?ôt compete with her home life, characterized by a lush abundance of people and places to go. 

Because this made me exceedingly anxious, I became afraid that she would leave and became anxious myself. I became self absorbed and distant to her emotions, because I interpreted her anger and frustration as a lack of desire to be with me. I gave up on trying anything because I didn?ôt want to her to have any friction if she decided to leave. I told her it was fine she needed to be home, because she?ôs only 21 and needed more adventures. I was proud of myself for handling it this way, until the final moments before she left (I?ôll get to this later). 

She wanted to stay in a long distance relationship. I declined because, at the time, I was interpreting her wanting to leave as a rejection of me rather than a rejection of the situation. Obviously, it?ôs a mix of the two but I believe it?ôs mostly the second one. Anyway, on our final day together, she wanted to cuddle for our last hours, and so we wound up in the bedroom. I emotionally was dead inside but held her nonetheless whilst cracking jokes to ease the tension. I stared at the ceiling, and she asked me what I was thinking. I told her, ?újust thinking about what I?ôm gonna do this weekend?? to avoid actually answering the question. 10 mins later she inquired what I was doing this weekend. I ashamedly replied that I was going to get laid, and this hurt her deeply, and she then stormed out. She reached out a few times, and I reached out a few times. The last time I spoke with her, she terribly angry. 

To be honest, I miss her and want her back. Other women have been disappointments in comparison to her.  But I honestly don?ôt want her back now. I?ôd like to wait until I?ôve had enough time to work on myself. Also, I?ôd like to wait until she?ôs at least out of college in a year before I would pursue her again.

However, whether I decide to get her back or not in the future, I?ôd like to see her blossom in life and meet her goals of becoming. Maybe even encourage her once in a while, even if it?ôs once in a long while. She?ôs deleted me on social media however. The relationship has been over for about 2 months. And she is still angry with me. I?ôve reached out to apologize once, and she?ôs still angry.

dulcinea,Things to consider when considering an ENFJ/INFP relationship,"I've been seeing a lot of threads about ENFJs and INFPs, and I'm not here to discourage it. I can totally relate the FJ attraction to FP, but I thought I'd present some thoughts to consider when considering such a relationship, potential pitfalls, and stuff considering that the two types are all 4 function opposite, so they see things similar but, kinda invertedly. I'm basing my observations, on my own experience with dating and befriending Fi types, and my limited knowledge of cognitive function theory, so please feel free to fill in what I might be leaving out or to correct my understanding if what I say is not completely accurate...

First of all, to the INFPs, something to consider about ENFJs, is that ENFJs tend to disclose, or at least look like they're disclosing a lot about themselves to a lot of people. Sometimes, they can give off the impression that you're especially special to them, and that they've confided to you something really deep and personal, but realize, as extroverted feeling types, for ENFJs, their feelings are not going to be as deep and personal as with Fi doms. ENFJs tend to approach and view people, more as groups. Not that they're blind to the individuality of each individual, but there's more awareness of the group and the group dynamic. 

Like, for instance, an ENFJ walks into a room with a group of people, and they see their best friend in the group, and they wanted to tell their friend something, but it's not particularly private. The ENFJ will probably approach the best friend, but also engage other members of that group so they won't feel left out. This may not be the case with every single ENFJ, but I've seen a lot with Fe doms, how many of them are more adept at engaging people as groups; I also find Fe's tend to often focus more on the behaviors and the dynamic of what goes on between people, than on the individuals involved. ENFJs can also be very chameleon-like, and can often adapt their behavior to be pleasing to people. Just remember feelings are extroverted so with ENFJs, they want them to be shared, they want a community. If you're friends with an ENFJ and they say something like ""I feel like I don't have any friends"" don't take it personally, because what they really mean might be more along the lines of ""I don't feel like I have a cohesive group of friends,"" ENFJs may have certain individual friends but still, sometimes might feel a need for a group that creates a sense of family or community, especially if, for some reason, they're detached from their own families. (Okay so, did I get any of this right, ENFJs? lol)

So, regarding INFPs. In my experience with Fi-doms, they tend to see and approach people more as individuals; if an INFP walks into a room with a group of people, and they see their best friend, and they have something they want to tell them, they might either draw the best friend away from the group or wait til the conversation is over, because they tend to feel more comfortable with one on one interactions with people than group interactions. Not that, INFPs don't do well in groups. I find when it comes to group interactions, some INFPs can be very charming. It depends on the person, but from what I've seen, they tend to feel more comfortable interacting with one person at a time, so if you see an INFP interacting with someone, deep in conversation, and it seems like they're ignoring you, they might not mean to, maybe they just feel more comfortable conversing with one person at a time.  Another thing I've experienced with Fi's is that they don't have as strong a need for a cohesive group, but have a strong need to feel loved, appreciated, and accepted for who they are. 

Here's one of the biggest sources of snags based on what I've seen of ENFJs and INFPs that I've known:
In my experience, ENFJs can be very assertive and confrontational, especially when it comes to needs in a relationship. They tend to like to have issues talked out and done with. I kinda think it's that Fe being the flipside of Ti, which I associate with a sort of ""troubleshooter mentality"". Fe doms like to improve things and situations. Things may not necessarily be bad in their eyes, but they're always looking toward ""How can we work together to make it better""
Whereas, in my experience, INFPs do not like to talk about things like that. They tend to be pretty laid back, and when something bothers an Fi-dom, often they just take it in, and not really address it, until they can't take it anymore. They tend to want to look for the positive in others, and be accepting of their flaws even if those flaws get on their nerves, so when an ENFJ addresses an issue, and INFP might take it personally, and feel like the ENFJ is not accepting them the way they're accepting the ENFJ.

Because of this, an ENFJ can easily be the more dominant partner. Like, I said above, INFPs can be pretty laid back. If something that they hold personal is attacked, then they might get visibly upset, otherwise, they basically let people be. I find, so far, that Fi types can be extremely vulnerable toward being used, manipulated, or talked into doing things they don't really want to do. ENFJs, on the other hand, well, the ones I've known at least, tend to have a way of taking the lead without realizing it sometimes, and while most ENFJs are not manipulative, it can lead to a situation in which the ENFJ can get their way wayyy more than the INFP, simply because they are more assertive with their needs.

The most important thing is to understand each other. Personally, even though I'm not an ENFJ, as far as I know, as an FJ, I could see myself with an FP despite our inherited differences, so based on what I've learned, the best thing is to, primarily understand the person as an individual. We are not completely defined by our functions, but each person is unique. Secondarily, it wouldn't hurt for an ENFJ to learn as much as they possibly could about Fi, and for the INFP to learn as much as they possibly can about Fe, and to realize that one is not necessarily better than the other, and how the other person thinks is not necessarily ""wrong"" just because it was different from yours.

I hope this is at least a little helpful, and, sorry if I said anything that is different from your experience, I'm just going by what I know so far....",https://www.personalitycafe.com//threads/things-to-consider-when-considering-an-enfj-infp-relationship.274962/,,,,,,,,,,,

Grandmaster_E,Young ENFJ having a identity crisis,"Hi all,

I'm Eddy, a 26-year-old Dutch male, with a long story. I hope my English is ok.

I just recently discovered that I?ôm an ENFJ. I'm not just an ENFJ, but an extreme one: I score 80+ % on extraversion, intuition and feeling, and 60% on judging.

I feel so disconnected from other people, I've always been shy and I?ôve lived an introverted life. I know I'm a real late bloomer, which is very annoying. I've never been in a romantic relationship, and I feel very ashamed of this. This is just not normal, especially for an extreme extravert like me. I just want to have a girlfriend, I want to feel 'normal'. I've read all these wonderful stories about ENFJ's on personalitycafe.com and other forums, which give me a lot of hope. I also relate to a lot of problems other ENFJ's describe on this and other forums.

I have been visiting a counselor for about four months now, and he diagnosed me with having a severe identity crisis. According to him, I've never been through puberty mentally. He said that I'm an extreme shy extravert, and that I have an ENFJ personality. I took some test myself, and I?ôve read personality descriptions, and I concur: I'm an ENFJ for sure, but an unhappy/unhealthy one. I never thought that I am/was an extravert though.

I just can't wrap my head around the fact that I haven't found a girl. I'm not talking about 'the one', but just A girl. I've seen guys much more shy, more ugly, less intelligent than I am, and have had some success relationship-wise. These guys obviously got self-confidence because of the fact that they were able to get women.

I've had a lot of friends for the past ten years. I've helped them with a lot of things, even giving them dating and relationship advice, which is quite remarkable considering the fact that I?ôve no experience in that department what so ever. Why are they not friends with me anymore? Well, they pretty much dumped me, because they are in romantic relationships, and they don't need me anymore, or I just don't fit in there evolved lives. It boggles my mind.

I've two bachelor degrees, and I'm just a thesis away from obtaining my master?ôs degree. Now I even doubt if this is the right carrier for me. I doubt about everything right now. I'm 26 years old, and I haven't reached one milestone of life. No girlfriend (now, or at least had one in the past), no carrier (to peruse), no social life, no nothing. Hell, i don't even feel like I'm 26 years old already; a 16-year-old boy must be more mature that I am.

I've a lot of older, mostly retired acquaintances. They were very successful men and women in their time. I'm talking about business people, doctors, and artists. I love to talk to them, telling about my problems. They cannot wrap their heads around it either. I've been told by them that I?ôm the smartest, charismatic and promising man they've ever met; especially this young in age. This sounds great of course, but it makes me doubt even more. What's wrong with me? What (simple thing) have I overlooked, or missed?

I have a female cousin from Canada. Her parents are Dutch, and immigrated to Canada 30 years ago. She moved to Holland two years ago, she's now 28. She is the most beautiful girl I?ôve ever seen (I know, she family, so that's saying something!). She has a Canadian bachelor and master degree in neuropsychology, and is -also- a thesis away from obtaining a Dutch master?ôs degree in neuropsychology. She's also in doubt if this is her 'thing'. She's been single for her entire life as well. She looks very confident, but it took me just seconds to let my ENFJ-charm open her up: she cried about the fact that her two much younger sisters and her older brother were (getting) married. She also feels like she hasn?ôt reached a single milestone of life. She has various degrees, she is very beautiful and she immigrated on her one, so that?ôs not nothing. I always have great advice for people, but not this time. I don't understand the problem, let alone having a solution for it. I have the same problem, and I don't get it either. I think she's an ENFJ as well.

To me, it looks like having an ENFJ personality is a curse. It just doesn't work for me, and it doesn't bring me anything in life (as well as for my cousin). Great if it works for you, and I enjoy reading your stories, but it depresses me too.

I hope you can help me. Is this an ENFJ thing, or is it just me?",https://www.personalitycafe.com//threads/young-enfj-having-a-identity-crisis.85097/,,,,,,,,,,,
nchurch,Calling for two  ENFJ Volunteers,"Hello everyone, 

Yesterday I posted a request for feedback from members of the ENFJ Forum about profiles that have been developed for this Type. I am very grateful for the responses I received. I made a similar request to the other 15 Forum members as well and intend to do the same with this posting. 

I recently published the ENFJ profile that I have developed over the years and am hoping that I can publish the next version of this profile with the direct help of ENFJs themselves. While I have attempted to put this profile together in the language of ENFJs, I must admit that this is not my own MBTI type and, therefore, I am quite sure that I have not met the mark. 

Here?ôs what I am looking for specifically. I would like to identify two individuals to help me. The first would be a layperson who has validated that they are indeed a very strongly identifiable ENFJ who is willing to read the profile in depth and to suggest ways that it can be edited to reflect the true language of the ENFJ. The second individual would be an ENFJ counseling professional who would look at the profile from a clinical perspective. This is the perspective that led me to the MBTI in the first place. I am convinced that clinicians must be aware of the subtle way that each of the MBTI types can best achieve the highest level of mental health for themselves. I have little to offer these two individuals at this point, except formal written credit for the valuable input that they will provide, as well as access to all sixteen of the profiles I just published. Depending upon how successful the publication of these profiles goes, I hope to also offer monetary compensation as well at some point. I know this isn?ôt much to go on, but I am hoping that there are at least a few folks in this discussion group who are still reading this request and who would like to contribute to our collective understanding of the ENFJ. 

If it would help to look at some of my work, you can access my website at https://www.mythinkingstyle.com/ 

If you are interested in either of these positions on behalf of other ENFJs, please email me at mythinkingstyle@yahoo.com

But I don't dwell on an image, I move from one to another as in a movie, and they keep repeating themselves. i think it's all obsessive because Ni can't settle for a conclusion until it has enough data.",https://www.personalitycafe.com//threads/do-you-experience-ni-this-way.1301777/,,,,,,,,,,,
theelusivemissp,what to do about this confusing enfj. (super guarded and not an open person),"I've dated an Enfj once before and its the same thing. Very guarded and hard to get to know. Is this usually the case with Enfjs?

Anyway, i'm in the early getting to know you phase with this new Enfj and ive run into the same roadblocks. Like i know he is interested because he messages me everyday, when he says ""im going out now but ill message you when i get home"" he always does. Butttt I'm the one constantly having to lead the conversation and think about what to talk about. 

I try to bring up funny stories and i get a ""haha lol"" then he goes silent and doesn't know what to say. I ask him a ton of questions to get to know him better which he seems to like but most of his responses are quite shallow in the sense that he never opens up to have deeper conversation. I even tried to start by opening up first and talking about my insecurities but his response has been pretty lacking when it comes to that too! I just cant figure him out and its doing my head in. He doesn't seem to like it either when I bring up heavier topics too. 

Am thinking perhaps I should perhaps do one of the following:

a) play hard to get (though I am not sure if this works well on ENFJs or if it will even work on him because he seems to have some experience with girls ignoring or dropping him and losing interest once the conversation dies down)

b) tell him he is frustrating the crap outta me and why (but I don't know if this will change anything. I just worry he will think this is too much drama and shut off completely. Also im not sure but arent ENFJs very bad at handling conflict/confrontation?

bucolic,Any dark ENFJs out there?,"I feel like I'm a dark ENFJ. Basically still a decent person, but a little rough around the edges. I don't need deep relationships with most people though I might probe them to see what makes them tick and offer suggestions. Helping people but there's always a comfortable gap there so I don't get too involved, if you know what I mean.

If I find a person to be ethically compromised, I might play tricks on this person to get desired results. But most of the time I like to help people and see them thrive. I might be a bit of a control nut but overall have good intentions.

personalitvcult,Signs an ENFJ man likes you?,"Hello all! I was wondering if someone could give me an idea as to what an ENFJ man might do if they liked you? Some background:

A guy started working at my work about a month and a half ago, and instantly I hated him. I guess I was just being jealous and competitive, as he walked right in and earned the appreciation that I?ôd been busting my guts for for over six months, to no avail. But upon working on a one to one basis with him, I realised just how lovely he was. He was always friendly with me, telling me to take deep breaths when I got stressed out, just being the stereotypical healthy ENFJ. He gets along with literally everyone at my work, because he?ôs so lovely to everyone. I didn?ôt mean to develop feelings for him, but I did. 

A bunch of girls I work with have mentioned that they think he might have a thing for me. He?ôs extremely playful with me: tickling my neck and sides because he knows I?ôm ticklish, calling me by a petname, throwing tomatoes at me (we work in a food prep area), jokingly trying to trip me up and other things to try and make me laugh. Whenever he greets me he hugs me, and on one occasion I was having a bit of a panic attack serving customers and he dropped everything to help me, knowing that this would inevitably make his job harder. One time he found out I was walking home and said ?úno you?ôre not - come on, I?ôm driving you home?? We?ôve even got to the point where we trust each other enough to talk about very personal things to us. I?ôve been through some very bad things and he assured me that good would come of them, and told me he was always there for me should I need him. I even heard from a friend that someone was being horrible about me and he stuck up for me, and one time she said to him ?úI?ôm happy to see her [me] happy,??to which he responded with ?úI?ôm happy to see her always?? I can?ôt work out if this behaviour is flirty or friendly especially as ENFJs have a tendency to blur the lines. I?ôd love to hear your thoughts about his behaviour and maybe give me ideas as to what you guys do when you?ôre interested in a person!

Cacaia,The ENFJ/INFJ  functions Paradigm,"So...I have been researching, over and over, like a mad person, and trying to figure out if I am ENFJ or INFJ...Maybe to an unhealthy degree....
Anyway, I was wondering if we can, together, cross examine the functions as they behave in both types. For example, ENFJs are said to exercise during moments of stress. I *hate* exercising unless it's useful (martial arts makes sense to me as a form of workout; running in a treadmill reminds me of hamsters, and I don't see the fun in it). With that said, I *need* some sort of exercise to feel happy, whether it's martial arts, running, walking...But I need it to be a natural thing, not forced....am I making any sense? 
When I am really down in the dumps, I usually think that I am not loved or needed and am a burden on people- the last thing I will think of is exercise.....I'll think of spending the day by myself so I don't bother anyone.

So what kind of Se is that??????Is it in the 3rd or 4th place?

My Ni and Fe are 50-50, and so I don't know which one I developed first. What does Ni look like as auxiliary, and what does it look like as dominant???? What about Fe??????

Is anyone stuck in the same situation, where they are really not sure if they are INFJ or ENFJ????
It's not like there's a free test for this.....

nptype,Curious about ENFJs,"Hi all!

I met two ENFJs yesterday on the 3D game Second Life.  Before this, I was not aware of anyone I know being ENFJ.

The first chat I had with each of them were very stimulating and ""alive"", much more so than usual.  So I got a great first impression of your type.  Today I had another (brief) chat, which was initiated by myself (in contrast to the first two), and it was mediocre and afflicted with boring silences.

I definitely take a lot of responsibility for the disappointing quality of today's chat, as I am apathetic due to residual depression.  It makes me feel empty of thoughts and feelings, and so I find scarcely anything to say, which does a lot to ruin my chatting pleasure.  I can barely make small talk.  However, this was not at all any kind of prominent problem in the first two (""good"") chats, so I'm looking for factors beyond myself.

So I was wondering if it is common for ENFJs to be in chatty vs. unchatty moods.  I realise all types can have a bad day, but it did not sound like she was down.

If anyone would like to chat with me, to get an idea of what I'm talking about, just drop me a line in PM and we'll figure out a way.

I'm an xxNP; that part is beyond debate, but I've tested as all 4 NP types, most recently ENFP.  If I had to choose one, I'm leaning to ENTP when I'm feeling better (which makes me more extraverted), or INTP when I'm feeling worse.

Albert.",https://www.personalitycafe.com//threads/curious-about-enfjs.1301101/,,,,,,,,,,,
RingzJr,Male Neediness,"I think neediness is in every person, but I want to deal with the neediness of each gender separately. Males have a certain needy stereotype, which I want to explore with you all.

1. I want to agree on what neediness is, through sharing examples. 

2. I want to think about what a needy person's daily routine might be, to see what conditions could contribute to neediness growing within us.

3. I want to think of ways to drain neediness away. Is it as simple as getting laid? Male neediness isn't merely physical (masturbation doesn't solve a broken heart, for example), it has emotional components too. How do you drain your stock of neediness?

Personally, I think neediness drips in from the subconscious, perpetually like hunger or thirst, and it's either satisfied or not by your daily routine. I think sometimes you may not know or believe that you're acting needy when you are. And I think if you have a lot of neediness built up, then when you speak it'll show itself and disappoint everyone, to your dismay. So my initial thought is that it's good to dissolve it when it accumulates, and also pursue routines that'd keep it at a comfortable level.

That being said, I want to distinguish neediness from expressing desire for someone or something. If you have a passionate crush on some INFP, you may express desire for them without necessarily being needy. But if you irritate them with constant begging, and by ignoring their subtle rejections, then you're clearly acting on needy impulses. It's inside of us.

Have you been needy before? Are any guys in your life particularly needy? What are some examples of neediness?",https://www.personalitycafe.com//threads/male-neediness.1299227/,,,,,,,,,,,

Robert2928,Cognitive Functions + Neurology = How ENFJ brains work,"I've been a member of these forums for a while now and one thing I've noticed about those new to MBTI is that as soon as they don't understand the theory they attempt to dismiss it as ""pop psychology"" with no basis in reality and just a bunch of abstract mumbojumbo...well...apparently with advancements in technology we are able to see that Jung's theory of cognitive functions is actually supported via EEGs. Basically an individual's ""cognitive processes"" can be observed and turns out certain parts of the brain are more active for people who share an MBTI type. For those of you interested in learning more I highly suggest getting the book (https://smile.amazon.com/Neuroscien...F8&qid=1543607555&sr=8-1&keywords=dario+nardi) I doubt you will be disappointed.

Since I discovered Micheal Pierce's channel because someone posted his ENFJ video on the ENFJ forums I will be passing it forward to give our subforums a much needed break from the usual ""relationship drama"" and something about cognitive functions. Most youtube videos about MBTI suck and because the person making the video understands little about the theory and spreads misinformation. I made the mistake of skipping this video when I seen it in my recommendations awhile back and rediscovered it. He's talking about the content form the book above and uses video games tog get his points across. I watched all his videos about the functions and it gets my seal of approval. The guy knows what he is talking about and not just pulling information from his ass.  Would love to hear what you guys think about the video.

Little Egg,ENFJs and the Importance of Religion in Your Lives.,"Hello all you wonderful ENFJs!

So going by the few ENFJs I have met and watched on Youtube, 4/5 are deeply religious. The fifth one might also be religious, I just haven't watched the vlog where she admits to practicing a religion yet. I can see how religion can be very attractive to ENFJs and this made me curious about several things I would like to discuss with the community.

1. Are you religious?
2. Were you raised to follow a religion or did you adopt a religion of your own free will? Did you change your religion to a different one? Did someone introduce you to a religion?
3. What religion are you practicing?
4. If you are religious, what is it about the religion that you like as an ENFJ? Is it the doctrine? Or the sense of community? Both? Or something else? Please elaborate.  
5. What does religion mean to you; how important is religion in your life as an ENFJ?
6. Which of your functions does religion satisfy and in what way?
7. How important is it for your SO to be religious? Would you raise your children to follow the same religion or let them choose for themselves?

A little about myself: I myself am not practicing a religion. I don't frown upon it, I am knowledgeable of many religions and am respectful of all but certainly I don't know about all religions. I find religion very interesting and I may become religious in the future. I am an ENFP and this type has a tendency to shy away from commitment. I'm not saying that I cannot commit to something, I would just prefer not to in order to keep more options available to me. 

I also want to say thank you to everyone who has taken the time to read and/or participate in this thread. The more questions you can answer would be greatly appreciated but not mandatory.",https://www.personalitycafe.com//threads/enfjs-and-the-importance-of-religion-in-your-lives.1289391/,,,,,,,,,,,
agodofhisownworld,How good are ENFJs with communication?,"Hi everybody INFP here who just wants to understand his ENFJ friend a little better and wants to relieve his insecurities a bit. How good are you guys with communication? Are you consistent? Me and my friend (who's a girl) have been LD friends for years now but she recently started her first year of uni. Up until when she entered uni, we were having conversations frequently. The longest we'd ever gone without exchanging a text over the last 3 years was a week. Nowadays the few times we do text, the conversation is rather short and ends abruptly because she just stops answering. I'm already in my 2nd year of college, so I understand her being too busy with her new lifestyle to text me as frquently as she used to, but I still get insecure about her just forgetting about me, losing interesting in keeping up with me, and then eventually replacing me with some other friends who actually live in her country. I also try my best to text at least once a week just to check in on her, but I feel like I'm being overbearing, so I'm considering stopping and letting her have some space. And I'll repeat that I know she just got into university less than 2 months ago, but I can't help feeling neglected in spite of that, as selfish as that sounds. But I'm dealing with it the best I can, and I wou;;dn't want to mentally burden her by telling her any of this because I know that would make her feel like shit. Our friendship means too much to me.

But I'll add that she's aware that she hasn't been great at getting back to me. Every time she has gotten back to me, she has been apologetic for not being better at it. And I definitely appriciate it.

I know that what I'm worried about is silly and I should probably stop being so insecure about my relationship with somebody a whole ocean away, but again, I can't help it.

But are a lot of ENFJs like this? Do you get so busy you end up neglecting your friends? Should I continue checking in on her weekly/bi-weekly or is that an annoyingly bad idea?",https://www.personalitycafe.com//threads/how-good-are-enfjs-with-communication.1294495/,,,,,,,,,,,

Evallo,INTJ in need of help with my ENFJ,"I was hoping to get some thoughts and advice on how to help my ENFJ girlfriend through a particularly rough patch in her life. For context, I'm an INTJ female although I think that having lived for almost four decades and being a mother has taught me to be more sensitive, empathetic INTJ. My gf and I have been together for a year and a half now, lived together since the beginning of the year. We are very happy together and are committed to one another but she has other factors that are causing her a great deal of stress. Lately she has felt like running away and told my earlier today that she is seriously considering going to stay with her mom (states away from where we currently live) for a few months to try and sort through some of her thoughts. Without giving all the complicated details, she is feeling very stuck and controlled by an outside element. She needs to give that situation time to play out before she can take back some control on that front. I've reassured her that if she needs some time that I'll support her and it doesn't change anything for me. At this point I am trying to make sure she's feeling as little pressure coming from me as possible. 

My questions are is the urge to run common with ENFJs, and if so, what helps you when you feel this way? Am I right in my approach or could me giving her space be viewed as not fighting for her? Any ENFJ specific de-stressing tips or thoughts on ways to help her deal with her stress would be greatly appreciated. I know that in the past I have gotten myself all messed up trying to feel when I should be thinking and it seems that she is relying to heavily on thinking right now.

Robotshorts,Advice wanted: Avoiding Confrontation,"Good morning,

I'm posting on here in the hope that I'll invite some enlightening insight into an ongoing issue my ENFJ partner is experiencing regarding personal confrontation.

She's the very epitome of an ENFJ, and an artist - a good one too, I love her work. She has an ongoing mimic of sorts, however, who seems unable to resist leeching off her ideas and effectively copying them at every given opportunity (tis the era of social media, this annoying shit just happens sadly). This has been a problem for some years now, unchanging, and it's something that really troubles her for a number of reasons I'll save for if anybody wants to better inform any advice they might have. Now, I sympathise for her, I really do; social media has very little bearing on my own life, and I don't care for it in the slightest, but it doesn't mean I don't appreciate why these distanced acts of creative theft are very frustrating for her. Regardless, I can't help but take issue with the fact that she simply refuses to address the matter directly.

She knows the 'thief' personally, has done for years (though they aren't friends and don't have any direct contact), and this problem really isn't going away. I don't care for confrontation myself, at all, but I feel I know when to draw the line, take a deep breath and have it out with somebody - diplomatically of course - and unfortunately, the more this issue comes up, the less I'm able to align my feelings with my partner's and simply comfort her, because at this late stage something direct really needs to be done. Put very simply, her mimic needs to fuck off. The problem is, my partner simply will not have it - she resists any and all suggestions to speak to her thief directly, and becomes rather irritated with me quite quickly for not just looking after her hurt feelings and for focusing on how the matter could actually be practically resolved. I'm well aware that practical advice is not always the best port of call for matters of emotions, but this has simply gone on long enough, and she really needs to go about this ongoing situation in a different way or it will just continue to upset her and render me an unwanted practical advisor.

Any thoughts on the matter would be most appreciated. I would very much like to help my partner out of this frustrating situation of hers.",https://www.personalitycafe.com//threads/advice-wanted-avoiding-confrontation.1294265/,,,,,,,,,,,

OrangeDude,Loneliness and lack of confidence as a child,"This is something I have been thinking about for a couple of years, so it might be the time to get some other perspectives.

I'm obviously an ENFJ and Enneagram 9w1. The thing is, as a child, say from 6 years to like 22, I was extremely unsure of myself. I have so many memories where I are in tune with how others are feeling, and put them ahead of myself.

I never really stood up for myself against bullies, even though I wasn't really afraid of getting hurt. I have a brother 8 years older than me and we used to fight a lot, and it made me used to getting hurt during a fight haha. Still, with kids my own age, I was afraid when they tried to dominate me. I have no idea why.

I remember my father dropping me off at karate for the first time and I was so unsure of myself and scared (again not sure of what I was scared of). Never did karate again. And it wasn't the physicality of it all, but more like I couldn't deal with everyones expectations on me. Like I didn't know how to act.

I was even scared of going into the ocean, which is so weird as I'm heavy into surfing now and not scared at all haha. As a result of being so scared of shit, I never did sports (except swimming which I excelled at) and never really tried to be friends with the sporty kids as I felt intimidated by them (I never stood up for myself). This resulted in me being friends with kids that didn't intimidate me but who I never really connected with either. It's like I understood and identified with the sporty kids but they never accepted me because I didn't do sports with them. So I felt like an outsider. I knew where I belonged but still didn't belong.

My own friends, even though I liked them, I was never like them. In highschool I had 3 seperate friend groups, all different from each other, but all of them NOT into sports. And then in my last year I succeeded in being accepted by a sporty group of friends, and I felt at home like never before.

Still, I don't understand why I was so unsure of myself as a kid. It really created a lot of problems and other issues for me later in life, loneliness being one of them.

Today I have a lot of friends who are the kind of sport people I always craved, but I still have such a huge gap in my own sport experience that I still can't identify fully with them. I can only do single athlete sport but when it comes to team games, I'm useless. It also eats me up that I want to be like them, could have been like them, but missed the train due to my own fear of who knows what as a child. The result is extreme loneliness even though I am constantly with people.

I realised this tonight again when I told my best friend, that I have to sort my life out and need his advice. He is an ESTP so I didn't really expect a solid reply.

His answer though blew me away. He said we should go eat something and then we can talk and he will help me. It was then that I realised i've never fucking ever felt that anybody really cared about me. It's like I play a role 99% of the time and even though I have lots of friends and they are good people, we are not on the same level except for this friend.. and maybe one other friend. Could I really have been craving this kind of connection with people my whole life?

My parents, although good people, never connected with me. Our emotional bond is kind of like the bond you have with your maths teacher, but you have seen them in their underwear lol. Jokes aside, they care but we don't connect.

So does anybody have anything to add to this? I'm not always sure if I am on the right track in sorting myself out. I struggle with depression, anxiety and contemplating suicide on and off for the last 10 years. I am planning on getting proffessional help, but that's not an option right now and I'm not really keen on talking with a stranger face to face with this stuff.

Just to add cause it might sound absolutely stupid to care so much about sport, but where I live, sport is ingrained into our culture and it might have messed me up a little in my forming years.

I did get out of my ""afraid of fucking everything (are we allowed to swear on the forum?) mindset, when I made a SPORTY friend who I idealised greatly. I then went to transform my whole life, started working out, made friends, started surfing, MMA and even started swimming again. I outgrew so much of my fears, l almost got shot a couple of years back haha and today I'm another person, except I can't do the sports I missed out as a child even though 90% of our male population can.

So I still kinda feel like an outsider, except I've upgraded to include depression, anxiety and suicide. It's really starting to screw me up but I can't seem to get to the root cause.

Just to add, our religion is RUGBY. I don't really care but I missed out on a lot of good memories for being to afraid of.. I still don't know.

It resulted in me feeling isolated. So my question is this. What the hell was wrong with me as a child? Why was I so scared? Why didn't I dominate the other kids? Why was I so out of touch with my own strenghts? Why was I always running away?

My life is really screwed up because of how I reacted as a kid. I might have exaggerated a bit on how many friends I have, as I don't see most of them regularly. Even today, I'm still unsure of myself in social situations, don't know why. It's like I don't let myself count, but not due to self-esteem cause I like myself haha. I'm just not focussed on myself when speaking with people.. but it's automated so don't know how to stop it.",https://www.personalitycafe.com//threads/loneliness-and-lack-of-confidence-as-a-child.1292641/,,,,,,,,,,,
Infjlady26,ENFJ guy used to message every day... we had a first date... then he disappeared?,"Long story short, I had an amazing first date with an ENFJ guy I met online. In the week leading up to the date, he was messaging me 2 or 3x a day... the date itself was just wonderful, great conversations, and towards the end of it he  leaned in to say ""so... may I call again?"" with a very intent look in his eyes, to which I responded ""that would be great!!"" 

Afterwards, he walked me to my car, and then turned to leave - he didn't try to hug me - is that unusual for ENFJ's, if he liked me?  The next morning, I awoke with fear that I had forgotten to thank him for the date (he paid, and drove a good distance to where I live). So I sent him a quick message, apologizing that I may have forgotten, and said I had such a great time. He responded, within minutes, to say ""oh no worries, you were great! I had a great time, too!"" with two smiley faces... so I felt better... and waited to hear from him again. Since then, radio silence.  Two full days... whereas he was messaging every day, prior to the date.

What could this mean?? Do ENFJs ever disappear after a date? Or is this a sign he lost interest for good?",https://www.personalitycafe.com//threads/enfj-guy-used-to-message-every-day-we-had-a-first-date-then-he-disappeared.1294111/,,,,,,,,,,,
MadryCzlowiek,Problem with ENFJ - A friend,"I met her 3 years ago I she became my friend. She was fine at first, but now she is so annoying. I know she's ENFJ - A  I know - not every ENFJ is the same. But I only want to know is it normal for ENFJ or she is just ""exceptional"":
1. She thinks life without 8372983978 friends is boring and if I don't have lots of friend I'm worse. I remember when I had an argument with her and she told me ""What do you know about friendship? You have only a few friends"" I don't have to have 98732987243 friends to know what friendship is and in my view my friendships are deeper than her, because she thinks if she know someone for for example 8 months she can trust him. And I need more time to trust someone.
2. She is always being a smart aleck, even when she isn't right. I remember a situation, when she was smarting off before a test and when the teacher gave the tests us back - she got 3 (or D). 
3. She is illogical. Her statements aren't based on facts, just on ""because I think so"" For example:
M - me 
S - she
S: He's very calm.
M: Why do you think that? You don't know him well.
S: Because he goes to bed at 10 o'clock and wakes up at 6 o'clock.

Mercy Myosotis,Another INFP girl asking for advice with an ENFJ :),"I'll try to keep this short

I did this small group project with an ENFJ in my class, and we kinda clicked. Well not kinda. It was like....i was living peacefully and quietly in my introverted bubble, writing poems, painting, baking cookies and daydreaming and just.... being alone in peace. I have a reputation of a quiet girl in our school. Then this ENFJ just pops out of nowhere and smashes everything with his hammer of pats on the shoulder, smiles, LOTS of eye contact, praises, jokes, supportive smile and awesomeness. At first I was really shocked, but now i just stare at him with awe. He really is pure awesomeness, brave, charismatic, friendly, supportive, caring.... i could cry just thinking about how great he is :butterfly:

We didn't really have any serious conversation, it all happened so fast and i was shy. I'm just a shy person, i can't help it! I mean, if you're gonna blow my mind and crash my world, at least give me one week advance warning. After the group project, he kinda kept watching me and trying to take eye contact with me, and i kept being shy. Now he has backed off, he no longer tries to talk with me or touch me. He still takes eye contact and mysteriously appears to places i go, like once during a break i was chilling with my best friend and he walked by us 26 times. literally 26 times. I mean, could be a coincidence, but still... and since he stopped talking to me, I've had withdrawal symptoms. I miss him around. 

I thought that this is a guy i really wanna get to know, so last time we saw each other, i smiled at him. He smiled back and then looked down. Why? 

I wish i could talk with him. I wish I could sit with him during lunch, or at least near him, and just watch him smile and laugh and make everyone feel valued. I love that about him, he has this awesome talent to make everyone feel valued and accepted. But I also wish I could get to know him, I wish i could show him my old treehouse and really talk with him in there. I wanna know what is his favourite cake so i can bake that to him when it's his birthday.  I wanna know his favourite movie so we can watch it together if he catches a cold. I wanna know what makes him sad, so i can hug him and tell him everything's gonna be ok. I wanna know what makes him hurt so i can kiss him till the pain goes away. And i just wanna be there, where ever he is, and watch him being the awesome person that he is. 

sigh.... head in the clouds, but I don't care. 

I've read that ENFJs like chatty people, maybe he doesn't like me since i'm so shy? I really wanna talk with him, but I don't know what to do. Write a love letter? That would be weird... Right now I just stare at him and look away when he catches me doing that, and I hope that he figures out my feelings for him  At the same time I feel he might like me too, but since he's an ENFJ, I don't know... He's nice to everyone. I did feel like I was special to him, but then he backed off.... Was it because I was so shy? I didn't mean to hurt him

theelusivemissp,How to get my ENFJ to make an effort?,"So I matched with really gorgrous ENFJ on tinder lol....anyway we been texting for about a month now and he still has been too ""busy"" to make time to meet up with me. Ive never dealth with an ENFJ before so would like some advise? Im an ENTJ btw so giving me definitive responses and schedules are important, and it drives me insane when I have to wait for any confirmation.

This is how it all went down. 

At first his responses were short and shallow. I would start conversations where his response was one word and he wouldnt follow up questions or comments which can make the conversation keep going. However he always responded within 30 mins. Thats why I kept being patient because when someone I didn't want to talk to messaged me I would rarely ever respond. The only time he would put more effort into the was after midnight. At first I thought its because he was horny and wanting to sext. Later he told me its because he finishes work around that time so his replies were not so abrupt. The conversations at that time however, would always somehow lead up to something sexual.....That bothered me.

So eventually after I asked, he agreed to meet up with me on his day off (Tuesday). Tuesday morning this is how the conversation went:

Me: Hey still good for today?
Him: Yeah I am looking forward to it! I'm going to the dojo be back in 2 hours
Me: Ok have fun

(2 hours later....)
Him: I fucked up....
Me: ok?
Him: I twisted my knee doing spin sorry we gotta post pone. But I heal fast

So this was super coincidental to me and I had a suspicion it was a last minute ditch because he either got cold feet or was unsure or whatever reason. We continue talking for the next few days until I got annoyed at his wishy washyness and went offff at him. 

Me: Look I'm pretty much done with this. You don't put in any effort. When you cancel a plan at least arrange another date to meet up. It feels like you don't even want to see me.
Him: I do, I really like you. If you can't see that then its on you.
Me: Yeah again, if someone wants to see someone the I'm busy excuse is a load of crap. There's 24 hours in a day, its not that hard to set aside one hour to have coffee. Im so over this
Him: So you're leaving me? (i literally rolled my eyes when he said that because it just seemed manipulative)
Me: I want you to at least admit you had no intentions of meeting me and didn't want to put any effort. Then this can be over and done with. I told you i been used and treated like a piece of meat in the past and its upsetting that you are doing it to me too. The least you can do is to be honest with me
Him: ok youre right I didn't make any effort and I was leading you on. I don't know why I did it. I really don't. Im really sorry. I wish I could tell you why I did it but I can't.
Me: thanks that's all I wanted to hear.
Him: but its true I really do like you. Listen I finish work at 9pm tonight can I give you a call? We could talk over the phone then decide what we both want to do?

So he calls me, we chat for hours while he was babysitting his cousin. Then when his uncle came home he got off the phone, drove him and proceeded to call me again at his own initiative. So I was happy about that. He said he felt alot more relaxed and really wanted to meet me after the long call. He also explained he works alot because his dad doesn't have a job at the moment and his mum has been sick for a year so only he and his brother works. He also said he would try to to see me this week:

Me: Soooo hows this week looking?
Him: My boss arrives at 4pm ill ask her to give me a day off then
(after 4pm)
Me: ????
Him: This week im the only one on shift who has a liscense and she can't give me any day off. 15 hour shift and sat is my mum's birthday.
Me: Oh all good i understand
Him: I will ask my boss on Thurs about next week k?
Me: What if she says no
Him: Then we will plan around it.

Anyways i kinda have this ominous feeling there will be more excuses again. I really don't get his behavior. Maybe I am not giving him a wow factor to want to be anxious to see me? How do I get him excited to me? What do you ENFJs like talking about that keeps you captivated by someone? 

And no, don't tell me to give up on him. I'm not ready to yet. Not until Ive exhausted all options, which at this point I feel I had not yet. Also do ENFJs like ppl chasing them or does it make them less inclined to be interested? I really am clueless when dealing with ENFJs. The thing is he always responds to me very quickly and all the time. Which I view as a good sign. And he has warmed up to me more and more but I have yet to get a definitive response as to when he will lock in a solid plan to meet up.",https://www.personalitycafe.com//threads/how-to-get-my-enfj-to-make-an-effort.1290575/,,,,,,,,,,,

mezzo,Hoping to Gain Insight from other ENFJs on my predicament,"Bit Long but looking from help from ENFJs

Hey everyone, never thought I would actually make a post. I have a predicament that I am currently encountering and would love to gain insight on what may have happened and what I should do moving forward.

I'm:    [INFP]
She's: [ENFJ]

So a few weeks ago I met this wonderful women on a dating site. I initiated the conversation after viewing her profile because there was just some special charm to the profile unlike others I've seen. It radiated warmth, was about her daily lives, and well I just wanted to get to know the person. At the same time though she lives on the other side of the state and knowing this I was a little hesitant that and well I always thought I would prefer someone of similar ethnic background as me. She messaged back and well this was 4 AM in the morning for me and 7 AM her time. She works night shift as a nurse and was trying to head to sleep but apparently the storm that was going on kept her awake. I tried to comfort her and somehow it ended up as her comforting me. Don't remember how that happened but I told her she's just so nice and bubbly and I wished I had a friend like that in my life. We then proceed to add each other on WeChat (a messaging app).

The next day she went and messaged me first in the morning, and I remember messaging back, but at the same time knowing that she lives far away among other concerns I believe I said I'll be right back as I was going to eat lunch. After lunch ended I don't remember who messaged first but we started talking again. And we talked for a couple of hours though the app. Then she asked me if she could call me. Just to check if I was a real person. So I agreed to just a voice chat and I'm so glad I did. She was just the warmest individual, great personality. We talked for 3 hours about our values and what we shared such as not drinking, smoking, looking for that one true love. after messaging back and forth again we talked again for an additional 5 hours that same day. I've never talked with anyone for more than 2 hours. The next day I talked to her again this time through video chat. We were both nervous, but after I saw her I thought she was just the most gorgeous thing ever. She's got a heart of gold, telling me how she doesn't care for a guys background, his wealth, and looks only at personality and looks. She said she thought I was cute, and kept saying that I was unlike other guys which I still don't agree with. What I did think though was that I never thought there was someone so perfect in this world. We shared a lot, and even though it was a just a couple of days we never felt like there was anyone in this world that we felt so close with. We shared each others images back and forth and well one day I told her I wanted to get back on the dating app just to save those images. She said no its ok I'll send u them and she sent me 40 or so images and explained each one (186 messages on my phone when I woke up). She proceeded to uninstall the app and deactivate the it as well. I went and did the same. ENFJ are so good at building trust and authenticity and to be able to get someone like me to trust that easily is tough. There was one problem though. She lived 1000's of miles away from me. When I told her she said that she will fly over. Which surprised me greatly. I told her if I was a friend I would tell her thats crazy but it made me really happy. She went and bought a ticket and showed it to me. I went ahead and booked an airbnb for her near where I lived. She said she wanted to meet me as a friend. We were both adamant on taking things slowly because we thought rushing into things would be bad. Everyday leading up to the day she flies over we would video chat even while she worked.

Then came a few days prior to the day of the flight. Everything was fine the day before. We were watching an anime show together. However today when I messaged her she didn't reply. Then when I called her she said she was running late. I got worried that maybe I might've did something wrong. Did I come on to strong I thought. I messaged her apologizing saying that I do not know what I did wrong. Then thats when everything came out. She apologized to me saying that she was already married, and actually in the middle of going through a divorce. She proceeded to show me documents she has filled out in march and filed just recently a month ago. I was really devastated, I told her why she would do this to me and lie to me. She said no she didn't mean to and she didn't lie, which in truth she didn't. I knew she had a tough past being dumped by her own mother at 18 and left to work multiple jobs to get on in life. That past didn't matter to me. I saw her as a strong individual. When she told me she was married though and going through divorce that was just a big shock. I overreacted quite a bit. She said that she was sorry, and that she was going through a tough time and that she would have to cancel the flight. I thought I was being pranked, but she asked to wire money with Chase to pay me back for the airbnb so at the same time I also thought it can't be? I have her on facebook, instagram, as well as know about her closest friends and their social media as well. She said everything that we shared was genuine, but that she just wanted to move on with her past right and just won't have room for love. She was in an arranged marriage for 5 years and the spouse wanted to have another wife, apparently this is ok in Saudi Arabia or something. So she wanted out. I told her I understand but too much was happening to me to really comprehend the situation. She again stated lets be friends and that maybe in the future if she finally moves on we can be closer than friends but for now she just wants time alone. She told me to not wait for her as and find someone else as she doesn't want to put me through that. Btw she's really romantic as a person, watching Korean, and Chinese dramas and knows all the lines and have used a few on me and always dreams of someone to just take her away. (her words).

Anyways I don't know how much of this is true, whether to pursue or not and how much time to give before messaging her again as she said she needs time to move on with her past. I'm assuming talking to me brings pain? or maybe this was all one huge prank.... and I'm just a dumb idiot :/ I'm definitely hoping that its not the latter cause I really do love her for who she is even with the situation she has. I too am a crazy romantic, and have thought about flying to her (but that sounds wrong on so many levels and maybe even illegal. ex: its a prank and I show up at her work place just to be put in handcuffs or have a restraining order put on me)",https://www.personalitycafe.com//threads/hoping-to-gain-insight-from-other-enfjs-on-my-predicament.1288441/,,,,,,,,,,,
DENFJ,Not being able let go of a friendship,"Hi there,

First time I post something here, even though I have read a lot of threads here.

I have something bothering me, and I would hope to receive some tips of how to develop and get through it.
I really have a tendency to get ""fixated"" over relationships several times. Like, I can't let go of a certain person and our relationship. Some of these times, I have kind of become scared as well, since I thought that I had developed feelings for the other person. However, I have come to recognize that I just obsess over our relationship very much. When I really want the friendship to work out, I get really devoted and want to do everything in my power to make it work. I think of every aspect and every possible scenario of how our friendship will develop. Still, there have been several times that these friendships have not worked out. Those are worst, since I kind of breaks me down thinking that I couldn't befriend that person, even though I did everything that I could. I can think about it for days and weeks without being able to let it go, until one day (maybe months later) when I finally just stop thinking about it. 

I sometimes think about if it has something to do with me wanting to help people, and get them to open up and feeling free and comfortable, (which I personally think that I usually help people with). 

Are there anyone else out there feeling the same way, and maybe someone that can hand me a tip about how to develop that treat?",https://www.personalitycafe.com//threads/not-being-able-let-go-of-a-friendship.1281075/,,,,,,,,,,,

I feel like I?ôm more introverted the older I get. I watch more, listen more, weigh everything I say more. I was also an only child so I love alone time and spend much of my time reading or doing hobbies. However, I feel odd that I?ôm an extrovert that often feels more introverted at times.

I?ôm a female in a male dominated field. I do a lot of public speaking. I connect especially well when addressing groups - I am then in my element, though I don?ôt necessarily like the lime light.

Maybe I?ôm becoming more introverted, because I have such a low opinion of myself and my abilities. There are enormous barriers in my field due to my gender. This makes me more self conscious and frustrated. However, at the same time I constantly cover up my abilities because I know how I?ôm perceived at times. So I feel incompetent even though I hide my abilities. However, I also feel bad because people get compared to me and they just don?ôt have my gifting then I feel like I need to dumb myself down more. 

I also feel like a complete jerk much of the time. I sometimes think I?ôm an ENTJ trapped in an ENFJ body.

a peach,ENFJ Care and Handling User Guide and Manual,"Hello, fellow sweetheart ENFJs! ??I just came across a Care Manual for ISFPs and loved it so much, I started looking for other ""instructions"" to different types, and thought you might like to see it too! My apologies in advance if this has already been posted;; Post by foreveranevilregal@Tumblr. Original concept by intpboard@Tumblr.

ENFJ Care and Handling User Guide and Manual?ãCongratulations! You have been chosen by an ENFJ to be an important person in their life. Your ENFJ comes in color coordinated and aesthetically pleasing packaging perfectly suited to both your and their needs. Although your ENFJ does not need to be cared for in the traditional sense, here are a few tips to ensure the most harmonious interactions with your newfound extroverted idealist.

Your ENFJ comes with:

Ten (10) color coordinated outfits
Twelve (12) small fluffy animals of your ENFJ?ôs preference
One (1) large box tea assortment
One (1) soapbox for speech-making purposes
One (1) electronic device for constant communication with others
One (1) newspaper subscription (most likely electronic) for staying up-to-date on current events and world affairs
Two (2) bookshelves filled with various types of literature
One (1) etiquette manual. Your ENFJ has never read it, nor have they ever felt the need to, but it has been included for your benefit.
One (1) burning life purpose that will Make the World a Better Place.
Custom upgrades: Your ENFJ will have some sort of creative hobby. Musical instruments, microphones, art implements, writing implements, and/or athletic equipment may also be included.


Software
Your ENFJ comes preprogrammed with the following traits;

Fe: Your ENFJ has an innate sense of how interpersonal affairs function and how one should navigate them. Keenly concerned with the state of others, both loved ones and humanity as a whole, your ENFJ strives to do what is best for others and maintain peace in their relationships. Your ENFJ will motivate, encourage, compliment, support, and comfort other people. Open communication is very important to your ENFJ, and trust is paramount.

Ni: Not only does your ENFJ care immensely about others, but they know exactly how to improve their lives. ENFJ units come with a preinstalled ?úlife purpose??program that presses upon them a deep burden to improve the state of the world in some way that is uniquely suited to their individual talents and abilities. Usually, this improvement can be directly connected to other people in some way. Do not try to argue the life purpose with your ENFJ. They have reflected upon it deeply and are certain that this is in fact what they want to do with their lives.

Se: Your ENFJ is aware of the world around them and its various sensory details. They are action-oriented and will take initiative to implement their plans for a better future. Generally, they will have good reflexes and appreciate pleasant and organizes surroundings. Decent at multitasking. Sometimes they will take too much upon themselves, which can lead to burnout.

Ti: This function acts as a filter for Fe and ensures that your ENFJ?ôs words and actions are logically consistent, accurate, and appropriate. Depending on the particular ENFJ that has chosen you, the Ti filter may function properly to balance Fe, or it may malfunction and either be overly manifested in critical attitudes or be entirely absent and lead to irrational behavior.


Getting Started

Activate electronic device and place in your ENFJ?ôs hand.
Make your ENFJ a cup of tea (preferably herbal).
Wait for the electronic device to register attempted communication from others.
Allow your ENFJ to drink tea and communicate with others until fully charged.
If step 4 does not work, initiate a form of physical contact, such as hugging or cuddling, with your ENFJ.
If for some reason your ENFJ is averse to physical contact, repeat step 4 but with the small fluffy animals arranged around them.

Modes
Friend Mode (default): Your ENFJ will want to befriend everyone they encounter. They will ask thoughtful and personalized questions to get to know the other person and want to establish a positive relationship with them.

Mom Mode (default): Your ENFJ is very concerned about others and whether or not they are taking care of themselves. Can often be found inquiring whether others have eaten, hydrated, slept enough, finished that thing they were procrastinating, are wearing weather appropriate clothing, have taken relevant medications, etc. Your ENFJ will do this regardless of whether the other person is younger or old enough to be their own mother.

Teacher Mode (default): Your ENFJ enjoys learning about the world, and sharing that knowledge even more so. They can often be found recounting an interesting article they read the other day or a cool discovery in a field that they like. Can be triggered by the phrase ?úI don?ôt understand?¶‚Ä? Your ENFJ will explain things in a way that you will understand. ENFJs are also prone to turning a difficult situation into a Teaching Moment.

Counselor Mode: Activated when someone is going through a difficult situation. Self-taught psychologists, ENFJ units innately understand how people work and will generally know how to be more helpful. Your ENFJ will validate and affirm the hurting individual and usually leave them feeling better. Warning: your ENFJ may give advice more than is necessary if relying too heavily on Fe and not enough on Ni.

Superhero Mode: Activated under stress. ENFJs have a habit of taking on more than they can carry, and it eventually takes a toll. Your ENFJ will insist that they are fine. Their eyes will glaze over and twitch if you question them about their activities. Asking them how they plan to sustain this schedule will probably induce tears. Beware. Your ENFJ has entered full delusion.

Pseudo-Introvert Mode: Activated under severe stress. Your ENFJ has become so overwhelmed that they are shutting down. Characterized by refusal to socialize, a marked reduction in activities, and unusual silence in their presence. Symptoms also include grumpiness, calmness, an insistence that they are ?újust tired??or that ?úit?ôs been a long week?? and increased need for sleep. Seek help for your ENFJ if they start to claim that they don?ôt need others.

Manipulative Dictator Mode: If your ENFJ gains pleasure from controlling others or getting them to do things according to their will which others may not have chosen on their own, they are unhealthy. Perform a diagnostic check to ensure that all functions are in working order. Detoxification of Fe or Ni may be necessary.


Relationships With Other Units
NF: The easiest for your ENFJ to communicate with due to their naturally flowing and symbol-laden speech. Your ENFJ will appreciate their idealism and encourage them to follow their dreams.

NT: Slightly more challenging due to the strict rationalism present in NTs, but can get along on a conceptual basis if their ideas are complementary. Your ENFJ secretly admires NTs but knows that they can never admit it to one.

SJ: Can be somewhat difficult to communicate with due to the concrete and direct style these types employ, but your ENFJ will love them all the same and appreciate their loyalty.

SP: Your ENFJ will be fascinated by SPs and how they can do things so easily, and will want to hang out with them all the time. Do not let the SPs talk your ENFJ into skydiving. They?ôll claim they can handle it until they start screaming halfway out of the plane.


Feeding
Your ENFJ will claim that they have transcended basic human needs such as food. Your ENFJ is a liar who will get very cranky if they forget to eat. A glazed over expression, extended silence, or general withdrawnness can often be attributed to hunger. Feed regularly. Chocolate non-optional.

Grooming
ENFJs are generally fastidious about personal hygiene and have established a personal style of clothing/accessories/makeup. May occasionally leave the house without an accessory or mismatched shoes. If they are busy, help them by organizing the outfit they have chosen and ensuring that every component is there.

Sleeping
Your ENFJ will eschew sleep, as it limits time that could be spent socializing and doing things. Remind your ENFJ what happened the last time they slept less than 6 hours and that sleeping now will help them function better tomorrow.


Frequently Asked Questions
Is my ENFJ really that excited?

Generally, yes. ENFJs look for the bright side in every situation, and tend to genuinely enjoy the things they claim to enjoy. Lack of affinity for something will be signaled by a neutral yet diplomatic statement.

Does my ENFJ actually like me if they claim to love everyone?

You bet. ENFJs are very particular about being authentic in their remarks, and will tend to give praise specifically tailored to an individual. They will not tell you you?ôre a great athlete if you?ôre not. That being said, ENFJs look for the good in everyone and usually manage to find it. So yes, they do love everyone.

But if my ENFJ lives to care for others, they surely must not need care?

That?ôs where you?ôre wrong. Although ENFJs derive the most pleasure from caring for others, they need affirmation and appreciation to keep going and feel like their efforts aren?ôt in vain. Be sure to regularly tell your ENFJ how much you appreciate what they do for you. You might find yourself with a pleasant surprise if you do.

My ENFJ isn?ôt being very nice.

ENFJs are emotional, caring beings. They are not always nice. They try to be, but sometimes they snap. It?ôs only because they?ôve been trying to keep it inside. Encourage your ENFJ to talk about negative feelings openly (this may take some persuasion, as ENFJs like to ignore negative feelings and pretend they don?ôt exist) to prevent such an explosion.

LadySophia,My ENFJ died... I can't... Get over it.,"My ENFJ love, passed away..... I feel like I've been hit over the head with a mack truck 


He had the most beautiful, deep, dark eyes and sweet smile; I loved resting my hands on his shoulders.... And kissing him when he wasn't expecting it.

But as he gave me back-hugs, when I had bad days, and kept saying, ""I'm here,"" ""It's okay,"" - that was truly the most magical thing!


He totally got me: best listener (ever), very, very sassy but also a sensitive... Talented singer... Creative and kind-hearted. Good sense of humor...

I idolized and respected him for 10 years. He was everything I wanted to be. He had this aura about them... Such a beautiful, airy, innocent energy. I used to think ""Geez he is going to go to heaven, God is just so obviously favoring him..."" idk

This ENFJ had an extremely hard life, his dad treated him like shit and he worked so much, at a young age that... I feel he lost himself... He was 27 when he died, but reminded me of a 15-year-old half the time. Most people just blend in and fit in with others, but my ENFJ, he never truly fitted in and you just felt it and so did he. 

But dealing with enough pain for 5 people didn't lead him to result to bad behavior. All our friends had the same thing to say about him: ""he is very hospitable.""

He wasn't perfect; he could be grumpy and really dramatic and too much of a people pleaser. Sometimes he would be depressed but had a indefinite answer about the ""why"". This made him have no sense of time and a bit of a handful to deal with at times. So I'd put in massive efforts to see to it that, he, instead of others, REALLY got his way. What can I say, seeing him proud and happy was better than eating chocolate cake.

I can go on... BUT he is gone. Badly I wanted to join him! But he came in my dreams and told me, ""I'm not leaving you"". 

Rubbing my hands down his sharp jawline, I recall and still feel him. Is this what they call a ""twin flame"" or whatever the hell that means, my beloved ENFJ-t. 

I almost flung myself off a building after he died. And I'm an optimistic, cheerful person - I just couldn't deal with the grief because I knew--I just knew, how can I replace him? I can't replace this ENFJ.

INFP's are terrible at ""getting over"" something. Am I too romantic and pathetic? 

We loved each other equally.

Sorry for my crappy grammar, I was using my phone. I just wanted to let you guys know how much I love you and all that.

Also, I am not a bias person but this ENFJ man was seriously the sexiest person alive. :blushed: I love ENFJs",https://www.personalitycafe.com//threads/my-enfj-died-i-cant-get-over-it.1285979/,,,,,,,,,,,
TypeOne,ENFJs unsure of the soundness of their own logic,"What do you think of the following statement?

Since ENFJs are ultimately unsure of the soundness of their own logic (Ti), they may unwittingly try to convince themselves through the act of convincing others. The more people they can convince that an idea is sound (Fe), the more confident they hope to feel about its veracity (Ti)]  https://personalityjunkie.com/enfj-type-profile/

Have you done this? Still doing it?
Are you unsure of the correctness of your own logic?
Does it bother you a lot?

And a scenario: have you ever learned something through study / Ti activity (like discovering something in a documentary), that happened to be a minority opinion / belief that you could not get approved by your family/friends. And what did you do? Did you stick to your newfound belief or did you forget about it?

Please answer one or more questions or just say something else about it.",https://www.personalitycafe.com//threads/enfjs-unsure-of-the-soundness-of-their-own-logic.1278881/,,,,,,,,,,,
Mynka,A turbulent ENFJ that started to become ENTJ - story by INFP friend,"Just thought I'd share this as I thought it was interesting. 

One of my best friends is a turbulent ENFJ and while spending a lot of time around thinking types in part of his course, he started to get ENTJ when he took the MBTI. Now as his INFP friend who had known him for a while my Fi was screaming definitely not ENTJ but to my amusement he told me all about how he was becoming more and more comfortable with the ENTJ profile as a depiction of himself. This guy is literally one of the most loving, kind, fun-centered people so it was kind of hilarious to hear him convincing himself he was a cold hearted commander, but I've also learnt to value his harmony so encouraged him to do whatever feels natural while suppressing the Fi. Anyway move on a year and he has come to his senses, but told me about how he felt himself connecting on a deep level during that period of his life with Voldemort, a classic ENTJ. He was going down a dark path :laughing::laughing:

Asianaries,ENFJ's...do you prefer to date INFP or INTP's??,"I've been seeing an ENFJ for a couple months and we had just gone through a roller coaster ride and it's not always at it's best.  I believed he is seeing an INTP girl on the side and it's barely new.  The reason I am asking is because he flat out broke up with me and said that we have compatibility issues.  I get I'm an Infp and consistently need my space and he is EXTREMELY NEEDY.  Connection wise it is great when we are not arguing...but sometimes he overwhelms me.  

Since I am curious the connection between the INTP will be... since his new girl hits that profile.

Penny,ENFJ Poetry Thread,"So I thought we should have our own poetry thread. Please do post your poems. Here's one I wrote yesterday:

My Parents

My Father

He never said much growing up,
Not like now,
He goes on and on and repeats himself like a cuckoo clock,
Though no one can say he isn?ôt supremely thorough in everything he does,
But I digress,
I don?ôt remember anything he ever said to me as a child,
Except-,
All bad of course,
My father,
Who houses me from not too far away,
Pays for my car??
I guess it?ôs his way of showing his love,
In any case I?ôll take it,
Since on my own I am homeless and broke,
Now I drive, and sleep easy,
For my father,
Who never not worked a day,
In his life,
Even though now he?ôs retired,
He?ôs not perfect,
He?ôs done things I?ôve had to find in myself to forgive,
But??
He loves me,
And a lot of love is not something I have,
So I take what I get,
And know how I am blessed,
With the father I?ôve got,
Whom I?ôve grown to love.

My Mother

My mother has a touch of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,
She cleans like she's on crack and stockpiles cleaning supplies like a doomsday bunker full of food,
It manifests too in other ways,
Like in how maniacly she plays, doing her thing,
Like marathon Mahjongg games and intense stretches of gardening,
My mother is sweet like candy I am so blessed,
To have a mother like her,
Even though she sometimes talks about people in a way they might hear,
Like when they are right there, way too near for what she is saying,
She?ôs smart though in general,
Was top of her nursing class, even with a language barrier,
And she gives good advice,
I always regret when I didn?ôt listen,
Except for when she told me to marry a rich man,
Instead I divorced a poor man and married a dog,
That's what I think of my new boyfriend at least,
My big doggy, he?ôs a little more useful but not by a lot,
My mother is scared of his tattoos, they are grotesque,
Because of them she doesn?ôt invite him over much,
She?ôs funny like that,
But still, she occasionally makes him some food,
Ah yes, my mother,
Who took me fishing once where I caught a goldfish,
She always had a delicious meal ready,
And a girls??day shopping trip planned,
Yes, to me she?ôs rich,
Not filthy rich but well off,
Except in love the flow is steady,
If I could say one thing to her, this I?ôd say,
You?ôve taught me well, you?ôve always shown me the way,
For this how could I ever thank you or repay,
But know this, as we age, I will try.",https://www.personalitycafe.com//threads/enfj-poetry-thread.1280297/,,,,,,,,,,,
petrichor,Calling all Whovians! RE: Matt Smith,"I'm interested to know what y'all think Matt Smith's type might be. I am pretty convinced that he's an ENFJ, from reading biography stuff, watching interviews, etc. 

I think I've read somewhere that he plays 11 as an ENTP, which I can see for sure. That's all good and dandy, but I am really more interested in seeing what people think his actual personality type is.

lizw47,Met an Amazing Guy While Traveling Abroad,"I went on a backpacking trip for two months this summer across Europe. Before I went I did a tarot card reading that said something to the effect of ""you'll meet the love of your life while traveling across water."" Interesting side note if you are into that kind of thing 

I'm 29 and my type is INFJ by the way.

Okay so the very last city I visited is Amsterdam. I wanted to see the Netherlands, but was also sketched out by the idea of Amsterdam. I'm admittedly a very good girl -- I don't drink, smoke, do drugs, party. So I was not at all into the pot and prostitution scene that many people go to Amsterdam for. When booking my trip, I found a Christian hostel in the city and was like ""Score!"" It was right up my alley. The whole place is covered in Jesus artwork, there's Bible readings, you get the idea. And it's all Christian volunteers who run the place. 

First night there I get checked into the hostel by a supppeerrrr cute guy. He asked me where I was from (the United States). He went to college in the United States so we spent time talking about that, his time in college. We talked about my trip so far. I went to bed after he checked me in.

I'm going to guess he is ENFJ based on the behavior I saw in two days but don't shoot me if I'm wrong 

The next day he was working in the restaurant of the hostel and we spent time talking with each other. Mind you this is a small little cafe, think like a Starbucks size cafe where the hostel is serving food. He asked me about what I majored in, I told him religious studies, he acted like he hadn't really heard of it before so he wanted me to explain to him more about what religious studies entails. He asked me if I was a practicing Christian -- obviously something important to him as a Christian himself. 

He asked me ""So, what did you do today?"" He wanted to know every detail about what I had done that day sightseeing, so I told him about the places I went and he asked more questions. 

He is engaging me in all of this conversation while he is working. 

At one point he mentioned that he played guitar and he got up to play two songs in the restaurant -- SWOOOOON! He told me his first and last name, that he had music up on some social media sites, that he had made some CDs in the past. 

At one point I get up and order a hot chocolate and a snack from him. He gives me his instructions for ""his favorite way"" to enjoy it. After I'm finished he asks ""How was it?"" My style of flirting is just to be cute and joke around. I say ""It was the best one you ever made me."" (It was the only one he ever made me) He laughed and smiled hugely at me and said ""True!"" 

He's leaning forward over the counter of his cafe as we're talking. At one point he grabs a chair at the table where I'm sitting at and sits down to talk to me. While he's working. 

- Mind you, he's not talking to anybody else in the restaurant
- He's not asking anybody else how they enjoyed their meals
- He's not asking other people what they did that day. When is the last time you were at a hotel and the staff came up and asked you to run through a commentary of everything you did that day? Nobody does that. 
- Why would he ask if I was a practicing Christian? Guys ask girls about things that are important to them to see if values align.
- He's talking to me while he is supposed to be working so he's multitasking

I just have always believed deep down that when I met somebody, I would just know, things would just click. And it's hard to describe but with him I just felt this ""click"", it was an instant thing. 

He was very outgoing, very friendly, the type of person you could tell everybody loves. His coworkers were coming up to him and starting conversations with him, smiling. You can tell he is very friendly and has just a beautiful soul. (One of the things I hate about extroverts -- you feel special around them, but they are friendly with everybody, so can't tell if you are important to them or not). 

About 11 pm I left the restaurant. He saw me getting up and he goes ""Are you going to bed?!"" I said yes and he smiled and said ""Goodnight."" 

Unfortunately I only had a couple days in Amsterdam and that was all I got to see him...

But I have his social media that he gave out. And, my understanding is, if somebody gives social media, it is not overstepping any bounds to reach out, correct?

I went on his YouTube (he has videos of him singing and playing music) and made a comment on one of his videos. 
It was of course a very nice comment, reminding him who I was and saying that I thought the video was good.
A few days later I found that he had deleted the video from his YouTube. (??????)
Okay, that hurt my feelings.
Did he delete it because he didn't want my comment seen? Or because he is insecure and decided he hated the video? 
Was he flirting with me back at the hotel? Or was he just being friendly because its the Christian thing to do? 

I sent him a Facebook friend request but it has been two weeks and he has been ignoring it. 

I'm just really perplexed by the whole situation.
This guy is a very sweet kind Christian guy, and I know that he would never intentionally hurt somebody, and honestly I did not think he would do something like delete my comment or ignore me. 
Also we got along so well in person that I thought he would at least reply to my comment. 
Also he gave me his social media so... its not like I'm out here stalking him. He gave me his first and last name. 
I still have access to his Instagram and YouTube and those are public and I can follow him even if he doesn't want to be friends lol.
Ahhhhhh I'm so confused.",https://www.personalitycafe.com//threads/met-an-amazing-guy-while-traveling-abroad.1284407/,,,,,,,,,,,
Haludh,"Fellow ENFJs, how do you relate to Ti?","Growing up with my brother, an INTP, my shitty logic was often pointed out to me. Over time, I've come to fixate on whether or not what I'm saying makes sense; in person, that manifests as a refusal to explain myself, knowing I won't be able to organize my thoughts on the spot; online, it manifests as taking ages to write up posts (triple-checking grammar, restructuring sentences to maximize clarity, etc.). I find that my Fe and Ti have an inverse relationship where allowing my Fe to do whatever it wants subtracts from my ability to utilize Ti and focusing on Ti issues inhibits my expression (Fe).

Do you experience Ti similarly? If not, how do you experience it? Have you managed to strike a balance between Fe and Ti?",https://www.personalitycafe.com//threads/fellow-enfjs-how-do-you-relate-to-ti.1279217/,,,,,,,,,,,

Cation,ENFJ as a thinker,"Hello all,
Being an ENFJ I have of course read many descriptions of ENFJ's online so have a general idea of the picture often portrayed of us. I have reached the conclusion that while I am most definitely an ENFJ indeed and reflect many of the traits, I am rather atypical in that I seem to perhaps be a little more on the thinking side than other ENFJ's. (?) 

I would say I am a stereotypical ENFJ in that I am very idealistic and outgoing, take on leadership roles and care very much about others wellbeing and also how they perceive me etc.

However, I can often be somewhat cold or less like the textbook ENFJ. In certain situations I am far more matter-of-fact than 'sappy'. In an argument, I am often told that I am very quick to see holes in others' arguments and approach things in a very factual or objective way, without necessarily considering feelings - and am capable of ""ripping to shreds"" points of view that do not seem logical or well-thought out. I don't always make decisions based on feelings and I am easily able to switch off the sappy idealistic side and focus on plain facts and logic. I feel myself being able to ""switch off"" this side to me and revert to the smiley lovey side when I please - I find it confusing to use both sides at the same time. I suppose I am somewhat mature in some aspects for someone of my age. But I have no real way of being able to tell as I'm still young. Without the intention of bragging, I have always been high-performing in studies, mostly higher than peers with the ""smart"" types too e.g. INTJ, INTP. My closest friends are thinkers - an INTJ and an ENTP, and I feel that I often relate to them even more than my fellow NF's.  I am not very touchy-feely at all, not much of a romantic and was brought up in a strict household which was not particularly affectionate.

I'm not quite sure of this and would appreciate if those of you well-versed in functions etc or who were older (as I am a little on the young side :wink could help explain why I display certain traits. I very much appreciate any insight anyone could offer to help me understand myself a little more.  (e.g. more developed Ti? Upbringing?)

Karkino,Interaction styles of ENFJ (In-Charge) vs ESFJ (Get-Things-Going),"According to Linda Berens' Interaction styles Theory, ENFJ are classified as have an In-Charge communication style, which give them a desire to accomplish results, often as quickly as possible through people. They also tend to mobilize groups towards defined goals and have a knack for noticing what's wrong with their environment. 

On the other hand, their sensing counterpart (ESFJ) are put in the Get-Things-Going communication group. While they do possess the same enthousiasm shared by the dominant extroverted feeling function both found in these 2 types, ESFJ are more preoccupied by influencing and involving others in various activities. They are more of a people person than In-Charge types because of their inherent communicative and expressive talents.Types with this interaction style enjoy conversation and try to get as many people involved in the action, hence the name.

Most types paired with In-Charge interaction style are thinking and judgment types (ESTJ/ENTJ/ESTP/ENFJ);
Most types paired with Get-Things-Going interaction style are feeling and perceiving types (ESFJ/ESFP/ENFP/ENTP).

In short, ENFJ tend to naturally go for a leading position, striving for quick and efficient results; ESFJ will try to get everyone involved in an activity, hoping to facilitate its process.

What are your thoughts on this particular topic, and if you identify with ENFJ of ESFJ, do you feel that those behaviours align with your everyday activities and/or mindset?",https://www.personalitycafe.com//threads/interaction-styles-of-enfj-in-charge-vs-esfj-get-things-going.1123041/,,,,,,,,,,,
hyehh,Help!!!!when an enfj says they aren?ôt sure of their feelings.......,"Okay so first of all, I?ôm a female infp and he?ôs an enfj. We are both freshmen in college majoring in filmmaking. We got close while getting ready for the movie I was directing. And note that there?ôs a lot more I didn?ôt write down cause I couldn?ôt remember the details. 

The first thing I can remember is that I changed my picture of Facebook into a picture when I was on this quiz show in high school. But since then he would come up to me keep talking about that and ask me when I?ôll grow my hair again. And as I said we got close while getting ready for the movie. But before the shoot there was this festival at our school. And I met him coincidentally and he didn?ôt leave my side and so we ended up spending that evening together. But at that time I wasn?ôt sure of my feelings and was in the progress of getting over a former crush so I felt a little uncomfortable so I kept trying to bring a friend between us. While filming, because I was also the main character of my movie, I was bear footed and had only a shirt on though it was very cold. So every time a scene ended he would come up to me and put a coat around me and bring me my shoes. Though he didn?ôt have a coat or shoes on due to him being the camera man. And when I sat alone, he would come and sit next to me. And I had to put a school uniform on for this one scene. But he was like ""You look really good with your uniform on."" And there was a scene in the ladies 'room. He didn?ôt have to be there because someone else was in charge of the camera at that time. So all the other guys were just resting in the hallway. It was just me and this other girl filming together. But he came up to us and kept watching us film. And whenever I had to go to the shop to buy some supplies for the movie he would come with me. But I tried not to think this through cause I know he?ôs naturally a friendly person who likes to help people out. So, although I was actually interested in him I tried not to acknowledge it cause I might get hurt. And then we came to the last scene of that day. But we had to call a senior because of technology problems. So the atmosphere went a bit down. And because that senior was hurrying everyone I couldn?ôt but to call ok on cuts that clearly was an NG.  So after the shoot ended we were all walking down to my place cause that?ôs where the last scene is shot at. But while the others were walking in front of us we were walking behind them. Then he asked, ?ùIf you don?ôt like the cuts we shot you and I can walk back up and shoot it again. It just takes the two of us anyway.??Although I wanted to say yea I couldn?ôt because I felt so sorry. Anyway the shoot ended successfully and all the other staffs including him and I spent the night at my place.I spent the night at home. And when we were going to the groceries ( because this guy suggested he would cook for us) I was having trouble zipping up my coat. So he (the enfj) came up to me and asked if I would like for him to zip it up for me. But I said it?ôs okay. Anyway while that guy who suggested to cook was cooking all the others were talking in the living room. Then the enfj suddenly points out that he goes to church too. (I?ôm also Christian and my dad is a pastor. I don't quite remember but I think I said that I have to go to church the next day or something like that). While he mentioned that he also said that he started going to church last year cause he likes the songs and people rather than belief itself. Then he said that there?ôs Christian song he really likes and asked me to find it. Then we sort of fell in our own conversations while the others were talking about something else. Then after a while all the others fell asleep and I was talking with him (the endj) while doing my assignment. He was lying on my bed (cause my place is a one room studio). Then he gave me a pillow saying I looked uncomfortable and told me to sit on the bed. So I did. Then he rolls toward me lying right beside my beside our bodies slightly touching and kept watching me do my assignment. The I got all nervous and stiff. But after awhile Ingot tired so he told me to sleep. So he got off the bed telling me that he would just sleep on the floor like the others. But I told him that he didn?ôt have to get off and that he can just sleep on that side of the corner while I?ôll sleep on the other side. (vertically). Then I had to leave that morning but felt sorry to wake everyone up so I just left without waking them up. 
The next day was Monday, so I had to return the equipment I borrowed from the school. But I got a text from him saying that he?ôd go with me. So we went together the next morning then we decided to eat lunch togetherx. But our friend came up to us and asked what we were up to. He asnwered??I?ôm going to eat lunch with her.??So our friend just left like that. But I couldn?ôt wash that morning cause the water didn?ôt come out. So I was in panic and ranting him about not being able to wash. Then he said that he was gonna wash at his friend?ôs place and if I would like to come too. But I didn?ôt feel comfortable going over to his friend?ôs place so I said I?ôll pass. Then he said that I can buy some water bottles at the convinenince store and he?ôll help me wash my hair. But that was sort of embarrassing so I told him that that?ôs a good idea but I?ôll just wash my hair by myself. But I thought he was gonna go over to his friend?ôs place to wash so I said let?ôs meet after 20mintues. But then he went in a teasing way ?ùOh so you want me to go???So I was like ?ùNo no no! That's not what I meant.??So he came over to my place and I washed with the water bottle and then he washed. Then we rested at my place for a but before going out to eat. While I was getting ready I asked him which perfume he liked best from my collections. Then he said ?ùYou pick out what perfume you?ôre going to use every morning? That?ôs sort of cute haha.??So he picked one out for me and we went out. While we were eating he doing his phone. Turns out he was going through my Facebook wall and looking through my photos. He asked me all about the pictures. Then he talked about himself and I talked about myout. Then he took me to the bookstore cause we both like books. And while we were there he kept recommending books, and whenever I got interested in a book he would say that he?ôs read it before and would talk about that book and stuff.  So I bought three books that he recommended. Then we went to this park and walked around talking. And while we were talking he showed me a clip of his favorite movie. Then we just walked around the streets taking pictures. Then he remembered that I hurt my ankle and asked if Inwouod like to go to the clinic. So he went to the clinic with me and then we headed to our school to get to class. He usually sits in the back with his friend but when he saw me sitting in the front he said to his friend ?ùUh..I kind of feel sleepy..Do you want to sit in the front???And he sat next to me. But I fell asleep during class so he kept poking my face and touching my hair. But he does that with all the other girls too. And he?ôs really affectionate toward guys too. He?ôs just a really flirtly and friendly person so I had no idea he was doing that out of interest. He even told me that he likes touching people?ôs hair..So the thought that he was interested in me didn?ôt even cross my mind..Then after class he asked me to eat dinner with him and his friends(which were also my friends as well). So after we ate dinner I brought him and this other friend named A(an info male) over to study. But we ended up chatting lol. The enfj was lying on my bed again with my pillow. But when he saw me trying to lie down he gave me the pillow. And we ended up lyyng down on one pillow looking in each others??eyes. Then he kept touching my haid and head really gently brushing my face and ears really subtlety. So the three of us kept talking like that. A sitting against the wall. We talked about deep things about each other. Anyway then the enfj wabted to watch a movie so I sat beside him on the bed and A fell asleep. Enfj turned on the movie he showed me while we were walking around the streets that afternoon. We sat really close to each other that our shoulders were overlapping. And while watching the movie he would tease me by tapping me shoulders and looking away. And the kept brushing my ears and face really subtlety while touching my hair and stuff. Then he leaned against my shoulder. But even at that moment I was thinking oh he must think me as a really close comfortable friend. Anyway then he lied down telling me to lie down too. So we lied down our legs crossed. Then he let out his hand in front of me. But knowing what it meant I was afraid he might think me as a friend and if I held his hand he?ôll think I?ôm a creep I just high fived him several times...The next day at class he was late so I got worried. His roommate asked for me to call him so I called him he didn?ôt pick up. Then he hurriedly came to class looking for a seat. He met eyes with me and acting all awkward he sat next to me. But I hesitated sitting next to him because my feelings had grown the night before and I wasn?ôt sure what to do. Anyway we suddenly went awkward. But he looked over at me and started fidgeting with my pens. But i was so neecous around him I just smiled at him. After class we had another scene to film. He told me that he?ôll come back in time after changing and washing. I said okay see you later. In time for the shoot he called me back asking me why I called. Hus voice suddenly sounded so cold and mad.I said because your roommate was looking for you. Because if I said cause I was worried he might know I developed feelings for him.. Anyway he hung up with a ?úokay??but his tone sounded so so cold...And he seemed mad and cold for the whole shoot that day.. and even till the next day he was acting so cold and distant toward me. So even if I wanted to talk to him I couldn?ôt cause he kept looking at me with this cold frustrated look on his face.. Anyway but I promised him and few other friends that I would help them with their assignment so I brought them over to my place again. But while I was with the others he was being really cold again. And time to time he would laugh slightly but whenever I talked to him he would give me a straight face. He cooked for us so I jept going over to the kitchen to see if he needs anything and to help him. And I kep complimenting him and stuff..anyway while the others were leaving they asked why he wasn?ôt leaving yet. He said that he wasn?ôt finished. So it was just the two of us. It was akward for a while then he looked over me and pulled me toward him saying I looked uncomfortable and to come up to the bed. (Which is basically liek a couch now lol). Then after a while he warmed up and gave me his warm vibe again. He was being flirtly again. Touching my hair and putting his arms around my shoulders and all teasy and stuff. And we talked about stuff. Then I got a cramp on my foot so he laughed at me and took my foot and massaged it for me. Then he asked if he could see my emotion notebook. But surprisingly I felt secure showing him that. I never show anyone my emotion notebook being the closed and reserved infp that I am lol. So I showed him. And he listened really well. Then he saw the name of my former crush in there. I?ôm not sure if it was because of that, because it probably was hard to read due to my bad handwritng. But he suddenly went quiet and cold again. Then he asked me if I have anyone I like at church. I said I don?ôt and that they all feel like family to me. Then I aksed him if he did. He also said no. But I asked that quesiton as ?úDo you have anyone you like???Not ?úDo you have anyone you like at church???Because I assumed he didn?ôt go to church that often to have a crch there. But because he aaid no I though he was rejecting me.. anyway and then after he asked me why I didn?ôt drink alcohol. I told him why. Then he kept asking me to drink with him. But I said I can drink soda with you. And blah balh blah. Then it was time for him to go. But later I heard from my friend named B who is also very close with enfj, that, that night they met coincidently and he came up to her bragging about the assignment I helped him with. And that night i told him that I have never dated anyone before. And also toldB that I told him that too. And the day enfj and i went to the book store he told B that I must really like books and that i bought three books. Anyway then the next day at class things got even more awkward. He sat behind me and he wasn?ôt exactly cold but a little distant and there was this really awkward vibe going in between us. After class ended B called enfj to come over to my place to get her coat back from him. But even adter returning B?ôs coat enfj kept staying there until B left. But when B asked if enfj had anything going on with anyone he said no. And B also told me that when she asked him uf he had anyone in mind he said that he didn?ôt have interest in dating.. So I took that as a rejection too.. plus he was acting all stiff and cold too........ 
And after that day he just went completely cold and awkward. I mean now that i think about I guess I was like that too.. but still.. I asked if he wants to wat lunch together but he said he had to visit is friend at the hospital. Then a few days later I asked if he would like to go on a walk. He said he jist got to hus dorm( which you have fo walk up 2 HUGE hills) so he was too tired. Then i aksed if he wanted to study for the exam. He woke up an hour before class so he couldn?ôt. And so i felt so rejected.. So after that for about 2-3 months we were so awkard around each other. Like I can feel the vibe. He would always look at me with a stright face wouldn?ôt meet my eyes s or talk to me to the point where I felt like he was treating me like an invisible person.....But even while he was like that I can feel something going on between us and  I could see him trying to be around me and stuff. So after 2-3months of all these awkward vibes we got a chance tofiom together again and warmed up a little. So he texted me asking if I had time to help a senior he was helping so I said yes. But right after the day I got a text he just suddenly became so excited to see me. Like ge would call out ky name really loudly and say hi to me really enthusiastically. But I got startled by the sudden reaction he gave me so I just waved my hand awkwardly. Then he got all awkward again.. but still be was around me. Then after the senior?ôs movie ended I got sick. But of course he didnt know that. But I was so stressed because of the weird relationship he and i had. That freaking vibe. I didn?ôt want to gk to school. But while sleeping i had a dream of him and I crosspassing each other so i woke up feeling really bad. But rught when j woke up I got a call from him so I picked up the phone. Then he asked me if I was done with my assignment. I said i was. Then he went ??You?ôre so mean..??in a teasing way. SoI was like ?úwhy????And he just kept saying I was mean. Then I asked him if he was done. He said he wasn?ôt. So I said do you want me to help you? And asked where he was. He said he was at the dorm. So scared of rejection( cause everytime I aksed him to do something with me he rejected me) I said ?úoh..then I guess we can?ôt do the assignment together.??And then he got cold again. And he and I decided to go somewhere with a mutual friend. But she couldn?ôt go so he made plans with another friend asking if I want to go. So I said if if doesn?ôt make you uncomfortable. So before the day of our trip him, me,C and D spent the night at my place watching movies. C was a girl. While he lied down next to C he lied down next to me a little more. And whenever he came to lie down next to me he seemed to be hesitating. But when he lied down next to C, although theur heads and shoulders were slightly touching their bodies were?ôt. But when he lied next to me (although I went closer to him too) our whole bodies were touching and our legs were crossing and collapsed. Anyway the next moring C left early and I woke early to wash and then I woke enfj and D up.D is really close with enfj and is a male. But enfj went into my bathroom to wash telling me to send D home to wash because we need to leave for the trip in a few hours. So D left and it was just the two of us. But when it?ôs just the two of us he?ôs really warm. But not as expressive as he used to be before.. He gets uncharacteristicly calm and quiet.. and so things get awkward cause I?ôm like that too. But then we warmed up again and I shared some of my past with him cause the conversation went that way. But at the trip enfj wouldn?ôt leave C?ôs side and kept chattering and teasing her and stuff. And whenever i was close to him he?ôd get all cold and stuff.. I mean there were times where I felt like he was trying to get physically close to me like that one time where our hands brushed. But the momsnt our hands brushed I felt this tingly feeling like we were supposed to hold hands or something like that.. Sort of felt like he wanted to hold my hand.. but that?ôs just ?òmy??feeling so I can?ôt really trust it.. anyway so after the trip he and i had to spend the night together. But agian he was warm but really auiet and awkward when it was just the two of us......So I thought maybe this ?òvibe??I was fedling was just in my mind and started to give up. And D told me that he felt like there was something between us the whole trip. But then the next day my friend suddenly tell me ( this one friend who?ôs an infp said he definitely has interest the first time I told her. But my isfj friend said she doesn?ôt think he has interest because he?ôs just a really flirtly person.) but anyway infp says because he?ôs so cold when he?ôs with me she thought she was wrong about enfj having interest in me. But this one time infp, enfj, me and this intj had a one on one talk wjth the professor. And while one person was in the professor?ôs office the others had to be waiting in the hall. Enfj was first then infp, then me and the intj was last. But even after enfj was finished he didn?ôt leave saying that he was wating for intj because they were going to thus school event where they give out free dinner. But when I came out without wating more than 5 minutes enfj left with me saying intj was taking too lon and suggested to me and infp if we want to go tothe event too. But infp had to go to a meeting but so did I. So I was panicking over whether i should go with him or the meeting. But he told me to just come with him. So we ate dinner together. But even at that moment he was sort of coldish and akwarkd.. anyway what infp said was while she and enfj was waiting for me he talked about me. But the way he talked about me felt really sincere and caring. And infp probably knows best about me because I?ôve told her about myself the most and we?ôre both infps. And she knows that too. But depite that she said he knew alot more about me than she did. And the face and actions he did while waitjng for me felt so caring and was asif he was used to waiting on me. (Not sure what that excactly means though..) And while he was taling about me he could feel that he thinks alot and deeply about me even on regular days. Then my isfj friend suddenly says she was wrong about him not having interest in me. That he tries to hide it but whenever someone talks about me he pays close attention and knows what I?ôm doing and stuff. And isfj also stated that from what she?ôs seen he only pays attention to the things he has great interest in. Anyway after the trip Infelt the vibe getting stronger between us. Like we met eyes more often. He would look at me and we would lock eyes for a few seconds before looking away. But now that I feel that vibe getting steonger I felt more shy so whenever we locked eyes I quickly looked away. And he would sit next to me and I could see his body leaning closer to me but he wouldn?ôt meet my eyes or even talk to me. So at the last day of school he and infp were drinking. And she asked if he has anything going on lately. But he said that he doesn?ôt know anymore. He knows both are are busy, and it?ôs almost summerbreak, and when it?ôs summerbreak he and whoever that girl is (he didn?ôt exaclty say who) lives far away, and he has to go to army(cause in korea every man has to go to the army for 2years) so he doesn?ôt know whether to develop his feelings or not. So after i heard from infp i texted him and am still texting for 3weeks now. And we finally decided to meet up this week. But when texting he?ôs so cold toward when he?ôs really friendly with the others.... So my friend asked if he had anyone he liked a few days ago he said he wasn?ôt sure. So I was gonna ( if I still feel the vibe) ask him directly if he has anyone he likes. And if he responses honestly (cause being an infp I could probably feel if he?ôs not being honest to himself) I?ôll tell him how i feel about him..
So in conclusion what I want to ask is, do you think that ?òsomeone??he?ôs not sure of anymore could be me? And why he suddenly went cold and why he?ôs actung all cold and distant toward me? And do you think the timing of telling him my feelings is right..? Won?ôt he feel uncomfortable about me being too open and honest of my feelings..? PLEASE HELP!!!!!!!!?ò¢?ò¢?ò¢

INFPdreamer23,ENFJ CRUSH! HELP! How do you know if an ENFJ likes you?,"I'm an INFP. I am new to this site so I'm not sure if i'm posting in the correct forum so forgive me if I'm not. Anyway I have a crush on an ENFJ and had a few questions to ask the ENFJs on this site. (I am not close to the ENFJ. I guess you can call us acquaintances)

How do you know if an ENFJ likes you?

How do you know if an ENFJ just does not notice you or is ignoring you? (i have read other comments on how ENFJs will try and hide how they feel and become shy if they have a crush (INFPs do this too). But how do you know if they are being shy because they don't know you well vs being shy because they like you? Is there a difference? OR do ENFJs usually act more confident with someone they like?) we have talked a bit, sometimes one on one and they always get uncomfortable while talking about something they clearly care about. Is that an ENFJ thing? Do all ENFJs get uncomfortable when sharing their feelings? Also do most ENFJs hold back opinions if they disagree? 

We usually only interact in group settings. The ENFJ is always with their best friend, could that effect how they treat others or potentially act around someone they like?

What are signs an ENFJ isn't interested? 
Is there anything I can do to make the ENFJ interested?

I'm an INFP and on top of that I am pretty awkward and shy. Do most ENFJs like shy/awkward people or do they tend to like people more charismatic like themselves?

wums,Staying Present / Grounded,"Do you guys have trouble staying present in the moment?

I'm not sure if this is an unhealthy ENFJ thing, or a 4 thing, or if it's just normal. 

Even (or maybe especially) when I have literally nothing going on, a bunch of different thought trains will tend to run through my head. And I have a bad habit of half-doing things, even half-participating in conversations while half of my brain is busy thinking of something else. Usually it IS related to what's going on but, very tangential, and it might be a tangent of a tangent. Like if I talked about it, nobody would have a clue where it came from.

I'm trying really hard to pay deeper attention and be more focused on whatever I'm doing and truly live in the moment. I have a feeling I project my Ni too much onto my Se and that makes me basically an HSP. I get easily overwhelmed by sensory stimulation and trying to notice details and I take them too seriously. I'm kind of like a chihuahua sometimes and my nervous system seems really reactive. Like, if someone sneaks up on me and scares me I have a massive spaz attack.  High-strung is the word, I guess?

I REALLY want to learn to just chill.",https://www.personalitycafe.com//threads/staying-present-grounded.1266042/,,,,,,,,,,,
ElsaVonBrabant,How to help my ENFJ boyfriend finding motivation,"Dear ENFJs, I'm an ISTJ and I would really like to have a piece of advice from you: my ENFJ boyfriend asked me to help him find the right motivation to finish the last 6 months of his internship (he?ôs doing a 18 months internship at a law firm) and then the bar exam. 
I am still finishing my law university studies ??so I have not experienced yet the kind of things he has to face on a daily basis at work. He keeps saying that he ?údeeply admires the dutiful way that I schedule my work and time?? and that he thinks that I would/will be ?úso much better than him??in our future jobs, and  that these things naturally make me the best person to give him the right suggestions about what he should do. I tried to tell him that ??considering how different we are in so many ways ??I can try to tell him what I would do, but that I?ôm not sure that what usually works for me would work the same way for him. 
Since he keeps saying that his deepest fear is failing me and disappointing me, I told him that he should probably stop thinking about succeeding in what he does as a way to please me, but should instead think about it as a personal goal, or something that he?ôs doing in order to get where he want to be ??but not for me, for himself. Otherwise, the fear of letting other people down would just add tension to a situation that is already very stressful, and would not benefit him at all. Still, I know this is MY way of dealing with things. He is way more emotive and sensitive than I am, and is easily hurt if he doesn?ôt receive the emotional support he needs. 
So, this is my question: what would you suggest me to do in order to be supportive and help him? I love him more than I can say, and I can't stand the idea of not being able to do something to help him.

Snowflake Minuet,Inside and Out,"In general, how would you characterize yourself?

I'm curious as to how all the types perceive themselves in this way, so I'm posting this poll for every type. If you are not an ENFJ, please do vote, but not in this thread! Check back in your type's page shortly if the thread is not yet there. After I've received enough responses, I will post results and thoughts about it in the Myers Briggs page with links to all of these threads so you can check them out in more detail if you wish (probably in a week or two, I will try and mention everyone who responded in case you want to see it so you don't have to check).


______________________________________________________________??
Information for the poll:

First of all, I don't completely like the terms of warm and cold because one definitely has a more positive connotation than the other as far as personality goes, but they are also easy to use for this purpose. Considering that, however, please try not to think of them like that but rater follow the definitions for the purpose of this poll below.  

Warm vs Cold:

This is not so black and white, but try to think which you are most often closer to. You don't have to perfectly match all the words I brainstormed, they are just some both potentially positive and negative words which may be associated more strongly with either type.

Warm ~ expressive, open, emotional, affectionate, enthusiastic, excitable, passionate, ardent, zealous, ebullient, . . . 

Cold ~ rational, reserved, logical, restrained, formal, aloof, composed, calm, cool, tranquil, imperturbable, together, . . .

Outside vs Inside you:

Outside: how people most often would perceive you, particularly on the surface level or if they do not know you well/you are not very comfortable around them

Inside: how you feel about things yourself, whether or to that is projected outwardly, and also possibly how others with whom you are close would most often perceive you 


______________________________________________________________

??For responses, please feel free to elaborate however you please on the subject! Any type is welcome here, please only ENFJs for voting though. Also ask any questions you may have!

If you are inspired to, you can also copy this and highlight where you would place yourself on a scale, roughly between ""warm"" and ""cold."" This is more about you as a whole, the inside and out, then one or the other. If you said that you're colder inside and warmer outside, or vice versa, you'll be closer to the middle, for instance. If you said you were warmer both inside and out, you may still want to specify how ""warm,"" and it still may be closer to the middle. Follow your instinct! (I will also try to average the answers for these out by type for the synthesis post.)

comicbookmama,Releasing feelings through media or other external sources.,I find that often I unintentionally hold on to my emotions or push them to the side especially when I feel like I need to take care of others. This leads to delaying grief/stress/etc. I find that when I watch or listen to emotional media like movies it acts like a pressure release valve.

jeanvic,Help Me Understand the ENFJ,"I am an INTJ, and my best friend is an ENFJ. We are very similar people in many respects (sense of humour, values etc) but we also very different in important ways. I believe that part of what attracts me to her is that she makes no sense to me. I struggle to understand her. I thought that perhaps other ENFJs could aid me in understanding her. 

- She says that she has lots of friends, but only two close friends. I am one of those two. Naturally, for me, you're either my friend or I am indifferent to you. I don't understand how she can distinguish in her mind between friend and close friend, nor how she could come to such conclusions. Similarly, I either miss you or I don't. If I miss someone, it is clear I miss them. I am not quite right without them. For example, we work together and I have no fun when she isn't there and I miss her. She claims to miss me, yet will go to work without me and have just as much fun. This doesn't make sense to me. 

- She never stops doing for people. Sometimes, she runs herself into the ground trying to help others, some who are utterly unimportant to her in my opinion. No matter how much I advise her to rest, take time for herself and stop giving so much of herself to others, she insists that she is fine and that I worry too much. Sometimes, she will help others at the cost of sacrificing time and energy that could be spent with those closest to her. Is this a common ENFJ trait? What motivates it? What is the logic behind it?

- Do ENFJs struggle to prioritise? While my friend never puts anything before her partner and children, I do sometimes feel like she puts too much effort into unimportant pursuits and people rather than the important people in her life (e.g. me and her best friend). 

- I often feel like she tells me things to make me feel better. I am a turbulent INTJ and, at the risk of getting too personal, I do suffer with some abandonment issues and low self esteem. She will often tell me that she loves me, that I am in her heart and that nothing could ever ruin our friendship even though her behaviour doesn't always support this. Is it common for ENFJs to lie to makes others feel better? Similarly, is it common for ENFJs to be more about words than actions? I am much more about actions obviously so I struggle when her actions don't logically follow what she says.

- Do ENFJs enjoy deep conversation? I often talk to her about ideas I have had or thoughts I have been mulling over and she seems genuinely interested. The conversation will end with her usually saying, ""I definitely need to look into that when I get home"" but is never spoken of again. 

- Do ENFJs bury themselves in others' problems to hide from their own or do they have a good grip on their internal world?

- Do ENFJs know what they want or are they too focused externally to truly know?

- How patient are ENFJs? She seems to have the patience of a saint. There are many times anyone else would have lost patience with me, but she still persists, and it doesn't always make sense to me. I wouldn't put up with as much as she does. 

- How loyal are ENFJs? Being so extroverted, I imagine it is hard for them to hold down friendships for very long and to be liable to flit from friendship to friendship. 

- Is absent-mindedness a common trait for ENFJs? I have lost count of how many times she has seen a text from me or her best friend, looked at it briefly, put her phone down to deal with something else and then not respond for hours. I often tell her to just reply immediately so she doesn't forget, but the message doesn't sink in.

- Is stubborn pride common for ENFJs?

- Is obsession common for ENFJs? She is very much unwilling to let people help her because, in her mind, they won't do it how she likes it and therefore it's just better that she does it herself. E.g. housework. 

- Are ENFJs are a good fit for an INTJ as a friend?

- As ENFJs yourselves, would you ever consider a friendship with an INTJ and why?

There may be more questions at a later point, but I cannot think of anymore at this time. 

Any help would be appreciated.",https://www.personalitycafe.com//threads/help-me-understand-the-enfj.1279315/,,,,,,,,,,,
Dinognar,Why are you guys so attractive?,"I always found ENFJs appealing I don't know why. 
So recently I started getting close to an ENFJ guy and normally I don't really go head over heels for someone no matter how good they look or how nice they are but this is an exception. To be honest I can't even believe myself for being so attached to someone and I low-key hate myself for it (don't ask why). 

Any ENFJ guys want to give an ENTP fangirl some advice? Ladies you can chime in too. :heart:",https://www.personalitycafe.com//threads/why-are-you-guys-so-attractive.1269170/,,,,,,,,,,,
Scarlet_Heart,Can You Keep a Secret?,"I'm ENTP.  I have a good (ENFJ) friend who is wonderful in many ways and whom I have adored.  However, there's one issue.  I'm a fairly private person but, as we are close, I have shared things with ENFJ in confidence.  Some minor, some major.  

For the second time now, I have received questions from a mutual friend* of ours regarding things I've only told ENFJ.  The first time was more serious.  ""How are things between you and your husband lately?  ENFJ said that you went on a date so it's getting better then?""  Things hadn't been good between my husband and I and it disturbed me that ENFJ would be talking to our friend about it.  I explained it away, brushed it off, as it was the first time something like that happened.  This was maybe a year ago, a little less.

Today was the second time.  ""Hey how are you?  ENFJ said you had a job interview. How'd it go?""  Ok, well I didn't tell anyone about that because I wasn't sure I'd get the job and didn't want to have to explain the failure to everyone.  Also, as a stay-at-home mom who's marriage is in jeopardy, I was trying to restart my career, but didn't want to have to explain that either.

So there's a few things.  These quick questions from our friend don't tell me the context.  Why were they talking about me?  Was it just a quick fyi or were they discussing my marital problems?  Who knows?  Also, is there a restraint issue?  Like, I have this information but I just don't have the impulse control to keep it to myself?

Either way, I don't really feel like confronting her.  My style is to take stock internally of our relationship and say, well that relationship isn't what I thought it was and now I can only trust her so far or love her so much (as a friend).  I feel that even though she didn't divulge any serious secrets, I just can't trust her to keep things I tell her to herself.

So yes, at the end of all that is simply the question: Is this a common ENFJ trait?  Inability to keep a confidence?

enfp13579,"Super stressed ENFJ - I ended things to give him space, do you think he will return?","I'm an ENFP girl, and was seeing a ENFJ guy in a long distance exclusive dating relationship (not quite bf/gf). We met online and right from the start we connected really well. He showered me with affection and said a ton of sweet things, and we were calling each other every night. We would only get about 4-5 hours of sleep a night because we were both really busy people with multiple jobs and commitments. He would say things like ""I'm addicted to you"" and his actions showed it.

We met after about a month of talking, I flew to visit him. The weekend was magical and we got a long well in person too. We bonded both emotionally and physically and he said that there was nothing I could do that could make him not like me. 

A few days after I visited him, he went on a business trip and suddenly took days to respond to my messages. I gave him space since I didn't want to come off too clingy. After he returned from the trip, he grew more and more distant. I started wondering if he was no longer interested, or he was lying and had other girls or maybe got back with an ex. He would read my messages, but take 2-3 days to respond to them. His responses would all be ""I'm sorry I've been missing."", ""It's been really busy."" and it became all apologies and reasons for his disappearance. He did have quite a lot going on his life - multiple businesses, dying relatives, major health issues, problems at his day job, unsupportive family... I wouldn't pressure for a response even though I was going crazy on my own, but I stayed positive and gave him supportive messages to cheer him up. 

I managed to schedule a call with him (I had to wait 3 days before he had some time) and he told me he still felt the same about me romantically, but he's been so stressed and busy that he wasn't able to even think about dating. I liked him a lot so I said I would wait for him, and I even surprised him by mailing him a care package.

A month later, the situation didn't show any signs of improvement, and he only got busier and busier. So a few days ago I managed to get a hold of him - it was difficult to find a time, but I was able to catch him between meetings so he called me from his car. 

I told him I liked him a lot and I felt an incredible connection with him. But it's been hard the last two months not hearing from him. He told me that things have been crazy for him and he hasn't even been able to see his friends, and he's actually eating meal replacement shakes since he doesn't even have time to eat anymore. He said he gets my messages but he's usually busy and unable to respond, and by the time he gets home he's too tired so he often forgets. He can't really organize his thoughts these days and he's been working at least 16 hours a day, 7 days a week. He said he still likes me and really appreciated how I handled the situation maturely and logically and gave him a lot of encouragement throughout. He feels bad that he can't do anything for me since he's been so busy, and that he doesn't know when his situation is going to improve.

I felt that even though I liked him a lot and it's a pity, the logical solution was for him to focus on himself and that it wasn't the right time for him to be dating. I didn't want to be a source of guilt for him, and it's long distance and he doesn't even know when he can see me next. It's not really a relationship when you aren't even communicating with each other. He doesn't want to let go of the exclusivity but he agrees that's the best approach. I told him that when he gets everything sorted out and if I'm still single, I would love to try again and that he would have to chase me back.

1. Do you think he's telling the truth? People say that if you like someone you will prioritize them no matter what - as an ENFJ under extreme stress would you ever forget your partner? 

2. Do you think he actually likes me, or he used this opportunity as an excuse to get out of the relationship?

3. Even though I told him I would like to date him again if we are both single when he's ready, I heard ENFJs move on fast. Do you think he will come back, or is it likely he would move on?

4. Should I keep checking in with him from time to time (even though we 'broke up'), or should I really give him space until he reaches out?

Cthulhu And Coffee,Should I wait to see what he does now?,"Hi, thanks for clicking. Before I start, I should mention that I'm thinking he's either an ENFJ or ESFJ. He got ENFJ on the actual test, though (even if I don't think the actual test means that much.) And sorry this is so long. I don't really know how to be brief with these things. ._. 

Anyway, we met back in April 2017. At the time, I didn't really care about anything/was messing around with any guy I thought was kind of interesting upon the first conversation, so pretty much the first chance I got, I had sex with him before getting to know him. We hung out multiple times after that, but it always ended in sex. Eventually, realizing I was actually into him but that he was expecting sex to be synonymous with us hanging out, I decided to keep my distance. And yes, I'm fully aware that's on me for having started things off the way I did. Regardless, I had wanted more and figured I couldn't GET more, so I backed off. 

FFWD 5-6 months. I hadn't contacted him at all. One night, though, I found myself wanting to mess around, and I wanted it to be with someone I knew. So I contacted him; I figured, since I knew that seemed to be all he wanted before, he'd be down this time. He was. After it happened, I felt sort of weird and decided that that was it for me for a while. He got really angry when I told him that, saying I used him as a piece of meat (which was obviously true, but since he had done that to me in the past, I figured he wouldn't mind being that himself. I hadn't done it to him to make him angry, just it seemed like we were on the same page.) So, we stopped talking AGAIN. 

FFWD to present day, 5-6 months after ^ . He messaged me out of the blue maybe 2 weeks ago. We talked like nothing happened, and he invited me to the movies. We went, had dinner, and then drove around before he took me to his place without telling me where we were going. Mind you right before we got there, he randomly told me he liked me and still cared about me (which now I'm thinking might have been a ploy to make me comfortable.) Upon getting to his house, we talked for a while about more random shit in the parking lot until he finally asks if I wanna come inside or go home. I told him I was trying to do it right this time, and that I felt like I should go home, but that I wasn't going anywhere soon and we could still hang out in the near future + just see where it went. He said he was cool with it and took me home. Once I got there, I did kiss him for a couple minutes, but then I went inside. 

That was about 5 days ago. Two days after it happened, I messaged him some stupid video I was watching. He didn't have much to say about it/it was barely a conversation. It's been 3 days since then, and he hasn't said anything else. I feel like I shouldn't say anything myself. Part of me thinks he did just want sex, and was too 'nice' to say so. That irritates me because if he had just been honest about what he wanted instead of taking me out and telling me he liked me and all that stuff first, something MIGHT have happened in his favor. The other part of me thinks maybe he just doesn't know what to say, but I'm doubting it for some reason.

Thoughts? Should I wait a few days and just ask him if sex was all he really wanted? I wouldn't snap at him if that were true, I'd just tell him that the dishonesty did hurt my feelings and that I think we might again need to have space, most likely for good since I'm actually moving out of state next summer anyway.

Robert344,Romantic situation with ENTJ,"Hi all,

I am ENTJ guy and I have been ""pre-dating"" ENFJ girl for about six months (mostly long distance) but it is going nowhere and despite many positive signals and hearing that I am the ""best man she ever met"", she doesn't want to commit to a relationship. To help me understand if this has a future, can you ENFJs please give me your perspective on the following:

1) Could it be in ENFJs nature to not to say no to me just to avoid loosing me as a friend (or admitting that she has been sort of playing with my feelings at the beginning)? She just can't say No to a guy even if that is what she feels?

2) Can I safely assume that if she was really interested in me as a long-term romantic partner, distance or any other obstacle would not be an issue (I said I would move to her place if she says yes)?

3) Is the case with ENFJs that you have a period when you want to be free / do whatever you want to do with anybody you want and only then once you are done with that, you will come back to people like me and finally commit?

Even so, I find myself reluctantly drawn to him and it's an addictive feeling that is very hard to let go.

I have sent him a letter outright telling him that if he would let me, I want to be a source of support and comfort for him. I would like for him to depend on me and to not feel any loneliness.

Recently I made a friend who I am fairly certain is an ENFJ and she's a sweetie pie. We get along great and she's one of the most thoughtful friends I've ever had. The only problem is I think we have very different social needs and she has some mental issues that I'm not really good at dealing with. In a previous friendship with hers, she would hang out with her other friend constantly- almost 24/7, from what she's told me. She doesn't have much going on and I'm a student who's always running around, so when I do have free time I prefer to spend it with my boyfriend or alone; I maybe want to hang out once or twice every two weeks just because I'm so busy.

GirlNextDoor92,Where can I find an ENFJ of a specific variety?,"Hi ENFJs :kitteh:

I am an INFP who has a weakness for ENFJs. I love helping other people and being helped with kindness, and I think you love being needed and helping others. I am kind, hate conflict, love emotional intelligence, and adore deep, intuitive conversations. With that said, I am convinced you are the most ideal type for me. My previous romantic interests have been an ENTJ (who mistyped himself as an ENFJ) and an INTP. Neither of these panned out very well due to the lack of emotional intelligence.

I know this question has been asked before, but I have been looking high and low for a male ENFJ who subscribes to the same beliefs/ideologies as myself (Muslim). I volunteer at good causes, at my university, at the mosque, and I have only come across two ENFJ men in my lifetime: one was Caucasian, the other was South-Asian Muslim but two years younger than me lol and didn't seem interested. Where can I find more ENFJs with similar beliefs and values as mine, and proceed to gain their romantic interest? Do you have any tips?

Einstein,ENFJ thoughts on INTJs,"I have known two ENFJs and three ESFJs. All four of these people are around my age and know me fairly well. I have known two of the ESFJs about 2 years and they have both gone out of their way to get to know me better and talk to me. One of them was very interested in me and would try hard to get to know me to the point where they eventually asked ""Does it bother you that I ask you so many questions?"" The third ESFJ I have known for a few years and she often talks to me and asks what's going on in my life.

One of the ENFJs I have taken a few classes with in college but don't know super well, and the other I have known for a decade and know very well and see regularly. Both of these ENFJs have always been nice to me and seem to respect me, but have not tried to get to know me and will rarely start up a conversation with me or seem very excited to see me. The ENFJ that I know well will say hi to me and is very good about remembering little details about me and will compliment me, but doesn't seem too interested in getting to know me better and when she does talk to me it is sometimes just for the sake of conversation or to ask me to help her with something. She will occasionally try to include me in what she is doing, but other times will treat me as a stranger. Last month I saw her for the first time in 3 months and she barely said 2 words to me. She was very nice to me and didn't make me uncomfortable, but was distant.

This a bit of TL;DR
We usually talk mostly about deep topics in person and also through texting. He always responds with long and thoughtful messages. We were once watching each other perform. I asked him if he was nervous. He said that he never gets nervous. I said ""Yeah right, I saw that you were nervous!"", he told me ""OK, I was but only in front of you."" (he was shy when he said this) I was just like ""Ha ha ha, good joke, but I'm always nervous too"", but he said that he never get nervous, only now. I didn't know what to say to that since I couldn't figure out if he was joking. We were texting for about a week when he told me that there's this one concert with our professor and that he hadn't seen it but had heard it's good and if I don't have anything to do that time, there's an option. He always responds to my messages and our conversation usually ends for a day or two if I'm the one not replying/asking a new question. There have even been times when I've read the message and haven't responded yet and he later writes something more. I once told him that I like how he responds to my messages and he said that he likes that I like it.  So the day came of the concert and he hadn't texted me and I thought that he'll flake out. So I asked him if we're going. And he replied with ""Yes, of course!"" But then he acted strange... He was like ""How will I recognize you?"" (there was this other time when I went to my lesson and opened the door and he was sitting inside the classroom, he told me ""Oh, I didn't recognize you"", even though we had met like two days ago and we've met several times...). I told him that I'll recognize him. And he said that we rarely see each other. Is he messing with me? Or can't he seriously remember what I look like (and he can see me social media profiles...)? Or he is trying to imply that we should see each other more often? We joked, smiled a lot, talked etc. Some things that could indicate interest - he touched me several times. He wrapped his hand around my waist to pull me ahead when we were walking out, he also touched my lower back several times to push me forward or guide me. There were also many accidental touchings. At one point he told me that I had large pupils (I've always had a bit larger pupils than normal since I was born but I don't use anything ) and he said that it's like instant attraction or something. He asked me what I like to eat a few times...? When we said goodbye he went in for a hug and I did a stupid thing - I patted him on the back.. it was a hug with a pat (hopefully he won't overanalyze this). He also thanked me for coming and said it was nice then corrected that the concert was nice.... Oh and there have been other times when he has scheduled his practice time right after mine (because he overheard when I have it) and came early in time when I come so he could see me. He didn't confess this to me but I thought it was pretty obvious. Why would you come that early?

KateMarie999,ENFP/ENFJ relationship?,"Only found one thread on this topic back in 2012 so I thought I'd ask again. I'm an ENFP and I've been talking to an ENFJ guy for the last couple months, only to find out that we were attracted to each other. It hasn't been all that long and we're not jumping into anything but we discussed this today and it made me curious: is ENFP/ENFJ a good relationship dynamic?

As of now, we've been able to be very honest and candid with each other about our lives, the good and the bad. He stated that he feels like he can be himself around me and I feel the same. I love that he's so forthcoming with compliments and he's such a sweet person. He seems to like me for the same reason (according to him). We're also both huge dorks, so that definitely helps. I haven't really met an ENFJ guy before so it's kind of a new experience. Either way, we clicked very fast. I hope there's nothing hidden in that combination I'm unaware of but some of the reading I've done seems to indicate that it's a pretty good match.

That being said, I would love to know your thoughts on this. Again, we're not jumping into anything (we're still just friends as of now) but I'd like to know if there's anything to keep in mind.",https://www.personalitycafe.com//threads/enfp-enfj-relationship.1229609/,,,,,,,,,,,

From another perspective: 
Only say ""yea"", nods, smile, chuckle but rarely says his/her views. Doesn't ask follow up questions. Doesn't comment a word or anything. <<Doesn't seem to encourage the person ?!

Possibly From an ENFJ perspective(My Own Guess):
I don't know what to say, but the person seems to have a point, and I don't want to disagree with it. It's his passion to talk about design, though I know nothing about design but why not let him speak more? Maybe he will tell me his story about design~ *Then nods, smiles, ""yea"", sometimes chuckle too. (idk why is chuckle but they do this)

The subject is too complex. They start to talk about the philosophy of design... I don't know what to response but, maybe I should at least try to engage indeed, just to show some respect to the person.

Nobody_LV,I need your advice!,"Love letter to ENFJ - I need HELP!

Hi all,

I'm new to this forum even though I've been reading some threads for quite long. 

I'll try to make it short. I'm an INFP. I guess it comes as no surprise that I am currently in love with an ENFJ.  

Recently (a week ago) I gave my ENFJ a hand-written love letter where I confessed my feelings to him (because I could never do that in real life). By doing this, I wanted to know his answer on whether he is interested in me or not. So far I've received no reply from him. Complete silence. I don't know what to think or what to do now. We haven't met since then, but I could write him on Facebook whenever I wanted.

So, I'm really clueless now...does it mean he doesn't like me (in a romantic way), and avoids saying anything as not to hurt my feelings? If that's true than I don't get it...I wrote the letter specifically to know the TRUTH. I am prepared to hear what I don't want to hear and I wrote that it will be ok with time if that's the case. But this silence is killing me.

And actually I'm pretty damn sure he is in some way attracted to me since he plays the attraction by the book. (ENFJ crush/attraction signs threads here helped me to understand that). Unless I've overanalysed everything and only see what I want to see...

I know he might not be interested in a relationship now since he's super focused on his business, but that's why I wrote in the letter that I'm ready to wait as long as necessary and we don't need to jump straight into relationship. I just want to know if he likes me or not. 

Ugh, what shall I do now? I now kinda regret that I even wrote the letter...do you think it was a mistake? What could be reason he ignores me now when I pretty much demanded to know all the truth? Could it be he can't figure out his own feelings? Doesn't he realize that his silence hurts me a lot more than any kind of honest answer? 

How should I approach him now? Shall I text him or wait until we meet in real life and see how he acts?

I'm sorry for the rant, but I needed to spill it out somewhere, I guess that's why I registered here

GirlNextDoor92,ENFJ male broke up with me (INFP) suddenly. Please help me understand his behaviour?,"A mutual friend set me up with an ENFJ-A. At first I didn't like him, but he was sweet and said all the right things, and I began to like him a lot. 

During this period, he had his residency interviews (he was a doctor). I promised to wait until he was done so we could continue getting to know each other. He said to continue messaging him, and even if he was busy he would respond as soon as possible. True to his word, he always did. But I was usually the one initiating phone calls and texts. Yet, he was always sweet, flirty and assured me that he wanted to continue when I asked. He even told me very personal things about himself, such as about medical condition he has.

After he met me the first time, he said he had a good gut feeling. I began to fall for him. But I resisted certain values he tried to impart on me... For instance, a joint family system. I said I would do it, but I was scared of living with inlaws because it can lead to a lot of privacy concerns, especially since we are both South-Asian and abuse of daughter-in-laws is common in our culture. He told me he would protect me.

Towards the end of his interviews, he was excited to be done, video called me, liked my facebook posts, sounded so happy. And then he went to visit his parents. Before leaving his parents' place, he scheduled a phone conversation (included winky faces and sounded normal over text). 

He told me over phone that he had a bad gut feeling, but it was nice getting to know me. I was silent for a few seconds, couldn't speak. Then, he asked me a question about a spiritual practice (totally irrelevant). I don't know why he would do this. I am a spiritual person, but it wasn't right at a time like this. Then I said it was nice getting to know him too and goodbye. And he said ""Goodbye?"" and he sounded confused and hurt. What the hell. Can someone please explain to me this guy's behaviour.

Sven The Returned,Is it possible to be an ENFJ that's not so fond of humanity?,"So many of the ENFJ profiles I've read talk about the degree to which ENFJs love people/interacting with people and that's not really how I feel.  There are a small group of individuals for which I care deeply but humanity in general...eh, not so much. lol But that doesn't necessarily stop me from wanting to push people to be better--I'm fairly sure I'm an extrovert and gain energy from engaging the external world. 

I think I'm good with people, in that I understand them and know how to navigate them quite well, but it's not that I necessarily like dealing with them (lol or us), or even have any kind of optimism or sentimentality towards humanity en masse.  To be honest, I'm rather cynical about people and human nature and for as long as I can remember, have always been largely disenchanted with only sporadic bursts of idealism. I believe that we have it in us to be great, but not that we are innately so. And I feel inclined to help people reach their potential, but it drains the life out of me, to the extent that I question how much I actually like dealing with them...us.

Giselle,Need help communicating with my ENFJ partner,"Hello! I posted yesterday but I fear it was too tl;dr. So I'm asking again in summary form - any help is appreciated!

ENFP(f) dating ENFJ(m)

I would like advice on how to communicate with my ENFJ more effectively - having ""talks"" about problems seem to make things worse. How do I make you guys understand you're not failing us by not being perfect, and that it's okay to take care of your own needs first, and that saying no to something I want is *actually* fine?

Sometimes when he does things that make me sad I ""talk"" with him to understand why and make sure things are okay. He takes this as me being dissatisfied and that he is failing me when he can't change his behaviour even though I tell him it's okay, I love him regardless. He's also been neglecting his needs to fulfill expectations he seems to *think* I have of him (eg. seeing me almost every day, and when we are together he spends his whole time taking care of me - it's nice but def. not required). When I say it's okay if he needs time apart to do his own stuff, he says it's not fair to me for him to do that. This is now putting a strain on the relationship and does not feel sustainable.

I've been accomodating his habits and asking when he wants alone time - but we still see each other a lot and I can't tell when he says he wants to spend time with me whether he actually wants to now or if he feels obligated to and is still sacrificing for me.",https://www.personalitycafe.com//threads/need-help-communicating-with-my-enfj-partner.1220874/,,,,,,,,,,,
ash_hole,Advice Needed: What helps you cope with feelings when losing important friendships?,"Hello fellow ENFJs,

I am a long time reader, first time post-er. And may I just say, reading through all of your experiences, and feelings, and methods of coping with different situations as an ENFJ really has helped me so much.

But I want to share my current situation with you, and get your thoughts. Three months ago I moved away from the city I've called home for 6 years, and back into my parent's home (for financial reasons).

It was a very emotional move, as I'd made many of what I perceived to be very good, strong, true friendships, and considered these people to be my chosen family. Like a true ENFJ, I would constantly be planning surprises to show I cared, going out of my way to comfort them if I they were sad, I was always the first to lend a hand and bring everyone together. Upon moving out of my apartment, I left all the amazing furniture and art work I'd collected over the past 6 years for my best friend, who I set up with the real estate to move into my apartment when I left (which was quite a lengthy process), as he had nothing of his own.

Now that I've left, obviously I'm no longer regularly seeing my friends - but they still have each other. The group of friends that I brought together is still going strong, but I no longer feel like I'm a part of anything. The communication is dwindling, I feel I'm being thought of less and less, whatever news in people's lives is being shared with me less and less. Which is currently the source of a great sadness for me, because I feel like I've been trying my utmost best to keep the friendships alive, but I get the feeling my friendship is not really much of a priority for anyone else.

And I know I should have expected this to happen, out of sight, out of mind, and none of my friends are ENFJ or really seem to pick up on how the sadness is affecting me. Unfortunately feeling this way has me acting out of character, and feeling very insecure and needy, and not like how I normally am at all.

This behaviour has started to slowly but more and more consistently manifest when I' communicating with my group of friends, even though I have been going to lengths to try and contain it. I start becoming passive aggressive at times, very insecure, and even  little cruel on one occasion when I'd been drinking.

Does anyone else have any advice on how I can cope with these feelings in a healthy way, instead of having them bleed out onto the people I care about? They haven't done anything wrong, but the sadness of missing them and not being physically around them can be overwhelming a times.

glassperson,ENFJ Males & Dating,"Helloooo!!! I am an ENFP female who is very intrigued by an ENFJ male I met last week; we were conversing at a venue when we first met. We texted for the week and he invited me to a house party, then we conversed until the morning. Okay I'll place some info I feel relevant here:

- At the venue, his friend who I had just met said that he ""doesn't often see him speaking to girls like that"", like very one on one. Described him as ""quite mysterious/cool"".
- At the house party, his other friend who I had again only just met, said to me he ""ooh must be interested"" (without me provoking anything in the conversation hehehe) as he had only been invited earlier that night too.
- MAN there is like this electric exchange of attractive sexual energy towards one another so some things happened *wink* hahahhaa
- We are both naturally flirtatious (ENFs) but there was a HELLA lot of flirting
- Lots of cuddling and physical touch. Good conversations, regarding some strong opinions on general worldview, past relationships
- Weirdly comfortable around one another even though it was the first time we had properly spent time together.
- He pretty much took me to one side for the night for a one on one setting, but introduced me to his friends
- We spoke about our interactions in future tense, things like ""we have plenty of time to get to know one another""
- He appeared to like tailoring himself in a certain way, being careful with how I viewed him (e.g. ""I'm really trying not to come across that way!!"")

I have - in recent times (due to getting hurt a little in my past relationship) - conditioned myself to feel indifferent to looking towards signals of reciprocity of interest because I now prefer that carefree, go with the flow kinda approach so as to minimise hurt, but with this guy.. eh, I don't know. ENFJ males seem to be complex, and alas, enigmatic boys are my kryptonite *faints*.

Ages ago I read a lot about feminine and masculine polarity. I just want to get to know someone and enjoy them, but I'm not the best at gauging when to initiate, when to wait for the other to make a move etc. All of this polarity stuff said that feminine energy means letting him initiate, ask you out, text first, and basically you must be the receiver. After the party, we both backed off and didn't text the next day (I think space for a guy is important). I decided to say a friendly hello the day after and the conversation is warm as usual. I'd like to see him again, so I'm just gonna wait and see. I'm so conflicted on the whole M/F polarity theory of masculine courting the feminine, and modern cultural norms of equal efforts.

I just have some- well, a lot- of questions about the ENFJ male....
- When you like someone, do you take on the role of pursuer & chaser or are you more concerned with being subtle/cool?
- Are you cautious about a new romantic interest or very overt with intentions?
- Do you send mixed signals?
- How would someone know that you're truly interested?
- Since you're very charming around everyone, how would you differ in your interactions with someone you had more interest in?
- Is it always a case of friends first with you guys?
- Should I wait for you to come to me in terms of initiating things?

TenMac,Dark thoughts and Alone time for ENFJ,"Some ENFJ can turn to dark thoughts if they find themselves alone for too long. I wonder how many think this is the case for you. Do you start to think cynically and pessimistically about yourself or other people when you are alone. What do you think of?

I want to know if this is a result of high Ni coupled with high Fe. A tendency to stretch your observations about people and yourself and entertain sinister explanations for them and their reasons of behavior.

Secondly, going by ENFJ characteristics, there is a lot of thought into future plans. I know myself for sure always living in the future or the near future. Does this make you restless with activities you do when you are in the present. Is your enthusiastic optimism cause you to be bored and depressed with the here and now routines? For example, I decide im gonna start going to the gym cause i care about my body. I find myself putting more time in always planning for going than actually going into the gym.

Robert344,Is she really interested or just playing games?,"Hi all,

I need your advice, whether I should continue seeing an ENFJ woman with a prospects of entering into a relationship one day or whether I should simply walk away. 

Here are the facts: I met her first probably less than a year ago but properly started to exchange messages and going out together about 4 months ago. She lives in NYC while I live in Dallas so we cannot see each other every day but so far we have spent maybe 3 full weeks together but we are calling and texting each other a lot. She is always very enthusiastic about me and said to me that I am the best. We have so much in common and have great chemistry. Before she met me she was in a longterm relationship with somebody with whom she broke up about a year ago. But internally is still quite attached to him and still message each other. Since we started going out things progressed quickly and we are regularly kissing (on public but not in front of friends) and we also had sex three times. However, on public we are just friends but I was introduced to her brother and parents (as friend). 

She also says that what comes next should be really long term and involve starting a family. I have no problems moving to NYC for her and starting family with her because I fell in love with her. I have also done lots of very good things for her and helped her out on so many occasions. As far as I know apart from the ex there is nobody else in the game.

The problem is that, everytime I ask her if she wants a proper relationship (or even think about having a relationship) she says that she needs time to get to know me and doesnt want to give any promisses. Apparently, she wants some time for herself and doesn't want a relationship at the moment. However, I feel like we have got to know each other quite well by know. Definitely knowing if we are a good fit or not (in my opinion though).

Is this normal behaviour for ENFJ not to enter relationship with somebody who she claims is the best because she wants time off (and risk loosing me or the spirit disappearing)?
Or do you think that she is only playing a game and ultimately will tell me lets just be friends?
Or is this genuine and she is into me but for some reason (pls tell me what) doesnt want to say Ok, I will have a relationship with you? Is it too short?

oxesgurl,My crush stopped responding suddenly.. what should I do?,"Hello, so I'm an INFP female and I met this ENFJ guy on Tinder.. I fantasized about meeting someone with my ''theoretical ideal match type'' for a while now and it happened quite unexpectedly. It clicked immediately and I really thought I had found that deep connection I was craving for so long. We really texted a lot .. we could talk for 5-6 hours in a row, non-stop. In a 6-days time lapse we talked about teaching me guitar and piano, kids, marriage, buying a house, travel.... not mentioning how much we understood each other on the emotional and moral sides. He told me he really really like me, was very attracted to me, that I was on his mind and everything cheesy you can think about. It was surreal.

Then came the moment when we started talking about our love and sex history. At first he was chill and all and then a couple minutes later, he started telling me about how he could get really jealous and that even talking about the past gets him hurt and upset.. textually: ''I know it?ôs not right or fair because I wasn?ôt even around and you?ôre single so you can do what you want but it does get me jealous. This isn?ôt a thing where I?ôm saying don?ôt tell me. It?ôs a thing where I?ôm saying, I can get jealous and you should be aware of it cause I know I?ôve been really calm and chill with you but if I ever get angry, hurt or lash out.... you know why. I?ôm literally having a battle with the hulk in my head every time... and sometimes he wins'' ...

So I tried apologizing and he told me I have nothing to be sorry about, I did nothing wrong, it's his problem. I think I was also very understanding and supportive and showed no sign of being bothered by that.. the conversation still somewhat ended quickly but with the usual ''good night sweet dreams''. But then the day after, when I asked if he was feeling better, he just said not really, with no other words. Later that day I texted him again saying that this weakness doesn't stop me from wanting to be with him.. with no response yet more than 24 hours later. With fantastic Facebook messenger I can see that he saw my message. I can also see that he is not online as often... So now I'm really wondering what I should do.

With the Holidays around the corner I'm guessing maybe he has parties or family over, and got less time to be texting.. Or maybe he's just not wanting to go forward with me, I can't really tell. If it's got to be over then I really need closure, but I got a big whole nothing. No explanation, not even a simple ''please stop texting me''. Just plain ghosting. Should I wait? Is there any chance that he's gonna talk to me again, let's say after the holidays? If so then I don't want to spam and annoy him. But I also have a big urge to ask him to just tell me if he wants to cut contact... It's minimum respect I think...

Nynnu,How should we deal with aggressive ENTJ in work environment?,"ENTJ is one of our closest cousins, yet there some of their personality traits are very different from ours.


ENFJ- dislikes conflict. ENTJ-sees conflict  as a fun, challenging intellectual game
ENFJ- enjoys the company of others and try to bring the best of them. ENTJ- loves the company of other people, particularly minions, henchmen  and the others they rule with efficiency
ENFJ- influences people with charisma. ENTJ- influences people with logic
In other words, every time we work hard to strive for harmony in a group, they will gladly to make it 'different'.

In my experience, I find that a very skilled ENTJ can easily spot our weakness: which is nurturing but quite protective to our personal boundaries at the same time. :sad:
 All they need to do to push our buttons are: giving the logic why we should share info on our personal life in front of others and then asking very sharp intelligent questions about it. 

My strategy was to disclose the information as vague as possible and then try to establish another topic. But it won't be easy if the group contains around 30-40% of their very dedicated friends.

infpasheck,Relationship Advice ENFJ Type 3 / INFP Type 2 HELP!,"Hey everyone! I?ôm a INFP type 2 (25F) and I REALLY like a ENFJ type 3 (23M). We live in different states but I?ôm moving to the same one in a few months for work. He is someone who takes on a lot of work to meet his goals which is something I admire about him, but it is proving challenging in getting time to speak with him. 

For a little background when we met it was 2 years ago at a bar. The connection was instant and I never felt something like it before. We locked eyes and it was very intense. I thought about it for weeks. We both however where in relationships at the time and we only talked briefly but friended each other on social media. We didn?ôt talk again until 8 months ago when we both were single and I decided to reach out. It progressed slowly and we would just primarily have short text conversations. I ended up being near where he lived for only one night 4 months ago and went to see him. We had a VERY strong connection but almost said no words to each other (which during the time made me feel like I was being too boring) but the connection was very obviously there. We ended up hooking up (which is very out of character for me) but it was honestly so amazing and the closeness was like something I?ôve never experienced.

Since then we continue to check in on one another ever since. We have told each other we like each other and flirted but it hasn?ôt progressed as much as I would think it would have. I know being physically present is important and he works a lot but I also feel like I?ôm putting more effort than he is. Sometimes I will text him and not get replied to for a day or couple days, usually with him apologizing and having an excuse. Or I will share something with him and not get a very long response. Reading more on ENFJs this seems like somewhat normal behavior but I have a hard time not feeling like he?ôs ?únot that into me??

So with all that said my few questions are

If a ENFJ is quiet around you is it a bad thing? When we were around others he was very playful but when we got time alone he was very quiet and I was nervous so I was very quiet which seemed almost awkward. He once in a while would do something like break into song or do something light but we didn?ôt have any kind of deep conversation. But we had a very strong physical connection.

Could it be that I?ôm reading it wrong and he isn?ôt interested in anything other than something sexual and is just still talking to me to be nice? He did say he missed me, often tells me I?ôm sweet and wanted to spend time together when I did get there but other times he will call me words like ?údude??and ?úpal??that make me ????

Because of how hot and cold he has been though I have also pulled back at times and waited for him to be the one to reach out to me. So I?ôm not sure if he?ôs doing it because he?ôs unsure of my feelings or what. I feel like it?ôs pretty obvious that I like him though. It seriously is messing with my head! Lol. 

We both still after all this time don?ôt know THAT much about each other, or at least not as much as I?ôd like. It?ôs still very surface level. Should I be the one to try to make the conversation deeper? I have found certain subjects when he is uncomfortable with them he will pass by them quickly. 

Should I give him more space and not be quick to respond if he does the same? I know reaching out to him to show him I care is important but I also don?ôt want to over burden or be ?útoo much??and not have any amount of mystery. 

Any kind or advice or insight would be appreciated, I have never liked someone in this way before and am very hopeful. Thank you so much!",https://www.personalitycafe.com//threads/relationship-advice-enfj-type-3-infp-type-2-help.1194297/,,,,,,,,,,,

SOM,Help for a recently dumped ENFJ teen,"I am actually asking for someone other than myself, out of my concern for him. A family member of mine just broke up with her ENFJ boyfriend of 3 1/2 years. She loves him, but they are 19 and she was feeling like she was married. He needs a lot of attention via the phone and texting throughout the day, and gets upset with her when he doesn't get it. His needs seems worse when she is under school stress.  And, there are other issues as well. He is good to her in most ways, but she was feeling like 'a well-fed bird in a cage'. So, she just broke up with him and he is just devastated.

devsmess,Dating a Guy with NO Baggage/ Pain - Help?,"Long time no chat, ENFJs and onlookers. It's been a while, so I hope ya'll are doing alright!

I was hoping to get your opinions and insights, because... well, I have a problem that shouldn't seem like a problem at all. 

I'm an ENFJ (28-female) dating a male who I've tentatively typed as an ESFP. We were friends for a while before I was single again, and then I realized just how incredible he really was and he told me he liked me and we started dating. Things are going great, and I know he truly cares about me and loves me, too. I certainly see him as someone who I could be with for quite some time. We're both in a place in our lives where we're looking for someone who could be a life-partner, so we're both taking things seriously.

But here's the rub.

He has no... pain. I mean, kill me, right? He's just... whole. He's stable. He's confident, but not cocky. He's comfortable with who he is. He's been hurt in relationships, but he's gotten over them. He's just... okay all by himself. He doesn't need anything from anyone. He's happy on his own, but he's happier with me. 

I know what you're thinking. Well, damn, Steph, sounds like you found a real fuckin' keeper. What are you complaining about? He's hot, stable, confident, loves you, and you have really good chemistry. 

But my problem is-- I connect to others best through pain. 

My last two long term relationships were good relationships, and I was certainly in love before. In those relationships, I did what I did best, and it's something I think a lot of ENFJs do stunningly well-- take away other peoples pain through emotional comfort, shouldering or sharing burdens, and being there for them when the going gets really tough. I also really connect with others through being able to help them reach their goals, and encouraging them to push themselves. 

But... but he doesn't have that kind of pain. I'm not saying he's an innocent guy, 'cause he's absolutely not. He just... is so 'okay' with life. He claims he wasn't always this way, and that hiking the PCT in five months really changed him, but for the life of me, I don't know how in the fuck to deal with it. He's not worried about the future, he doesn't have any bad childhood baggage, his family is still together, he doesn't have any medical or mental issues, he's enjoying his life day-by-day without putting pressure on himself to get better-faster-stronger, he's just... he's so fucking 'okay'. And his goals consist of hiking more and buying a home in a few years.

And, ya'll, I'll tell you, I'm over here like, HEY ANXIETY, I'm feeling hella behind and lost in my life, I'm going back to school for another degree but unsure of it and really just want to make a difference and earn a good living and not have to work three jobs, I have a hard time relaxing, I have a mild martyr complex, I'm a writer, emotionally unstable (but not crazy at least), I journal about my problems, and get angry and emotional over things, and he's just cool as a fuckin' cucumber. And he's going to hike without me doing a damn thing to help him anyway. 

And I don't know how to help him. I don't know how to feel like I provide value. I mean, yeah, sure, I make him laugh, and we have chemistry, and we love each other, and companionship, and blah-blah-blah, but what is my PURPOSE in the relationship aside from to enjoy it? I need more DEPTH, I need more intimate connection, I need to get down there and scrape through him until I'm cuddled up against the marrow of his bones and understand every bit of who he is from his fears, to his flaws, to the secrets he's never let on. But he claims he just... is who he is, and that he's a simple guy and that's all there is to him.

I'm at a total loss. I don't know what role to play in the relationship, and I need one. I don't know what to do about it.

- - -

TLDR: I'm dating a man that has no emotional pain or baggage for me to help him through in order to connect, and I'm finding it hard to find my role as a value-provider in the relationship aside from just being a loving companion, which you can find in many people. How do you connect the deepest with your significant other, and have you ever been with someone who doesn't have pain? As ENFJs, I feel like we have an intimate relationship with sharing pain (hello, Fe), and not connecting through it is so strange to me.",https://www.personalitycafe.com//threads/dating-a-guy-with-no-baggage-pain-help.1182634/,,,,,,,,,,,

Kataro214,"Sexual, fun and sensual experience with ENFJ?","Hi! I'm an INFP male from Norway :ball: (forgive my English), and after my past relationship im not ready to seek for a new one.. 

However, I really want to have sex with girls just for fun- I know this is not normal to think for INFPs but my view at it is different from before.. I plan to not letting anyone get hurt in the process! And I would also like to explore sexually with girls I like. 
Naturally, ENFJ girls is the type I love and could find at parties most likely, as I like to dance and is quite charming when I'm doing it. I also look very extroverted on the dance-floor even though I'm not.. 

I already got the snapchat from a girl I believe is ENFJ, but I dont know how to hook up with her.. and mby ENFJ girls really dont like sex just for sex? As an INFP I value deep connection, and I'm sure ENFJ does the same. At least this ENFJ I kissed at this party!  :couple_inlove: The thought of deep sensual connection I could have with her during sex makes me 
dream nowadays.. :violin:

is it possible for me to have a romantic night with her? after I tell my true intention ofc. I might even like her as a GF but I'm probably not pretty enough (heh she is hot). Also, I'm prepared for only sex anyway so I won't get sad if that's all I get (I'd be more than happy in fact).

I wonder if you people have any thoughts on this.. what should I do?
Should I seek other types that is more likely to hook up for sex? In that case I would have to hide my weird self on the parties.. I kinda want to be myself, but I can find it fun to use my actor side as well. However, I really really want to avoid pretending to be something else to get some fun sexual experiences.

IddlePoetLion,Help an enfj move on,"Hola dear ENFJs, I'm in desperate need of your insight. I'll be as brief and clear as possible (which for an Enfp is nearly impossible but I'll try my best !

I've met this enfj online and we only met in real life last week after talking every day for two months. To be honest I'm not even sure he's and enfj but he seemed to have Ni and Fe. He's a flirt but also incredibly warm, considerate and romantic. He was pretty serious about our potential relationship and much more open about his feelings than I was (I have a pretty strong Fi and struggle with expressing my emotions but he encouraged me to be more verbal) He kept saying he was impatient to meet me and he was sure our relationship would work out. His words reassured me but I wanted to see how it would be in real life before letting my feelings overwhelm me. When we finally met, we spent the whole day together and it was A-Mazing. At first he was more shy than I expected and he was looking away when I caught him looking at me but we still bonded immediately. We saw each other the next day, slept together and the chemistry was overwhelming. We both said we were happy to FINALLY be together and we couldn't stop touching each other.

Now you may be wondering what the problem is and why we didn't ride off into the sunset ?
Maybe a little backstory would help understanding better. One year ago he ended a 5 year long distance relationship, and even though he is over his ex girlfriend and they both agreed to break up, it hurt him a lot. The PROBLEM is, I live four hours away from him and I was only staying 4 days in his city. I said from the beggining that if we wasn't interested, there were many other women in his city he could talk to. But he kept talking to me. The last thing he said when we saw each other face to face was 'I want to see you again tomorrow' and the following night he texted me to say 'He really likes me but because we probably won't see each other again he wants to stop there to prevent himself from being hurt'. Of course I tried to reassure him and we talked a bit but then I said, 'I'll be in your town next month, you won't want to see me ?' which makes me sound emotionally manipulative and I bitterly regret it but I was so disappointed. I asked to see him and he never answered. I was cheated on by my ex boyfriend and I felt like I could move on thanks to this enfj and I'm sad he thinks he can't do the same. I sent him two other messages to tell him that he was worth the risk of being hurt again and if he meant everything he said to me I'm sure he can let of the past. 
I heard that when enfj decides something it's impossible to make them change their mind but I just can't give up on people suffering. I was selfishly wondering is he was waiting to see if I would insit to prove he was important to me. 
Is it that easy for enfj's to express romantic feelings for someone every day and suddenly ignore them ?  
I'm desperate to understand and possibly help him if I can.

(LITTLE DETAIL THAT I'M SURELY OVERANALYZING) the night he 'dumped me' he conveniently took many snapchats of him having fun at a party. So either he moves on reaaaaally quickly, either that's what he wants to show. Also, I put something in my story and he watched it , so at least he acknowledges my existence.) Sorry for venting guys. BTW my amazing best friend is an enfj so even though I don't sound like it I LOVE YOU.",https://www.personalitycafe.com//threads/help-an-enfj-move-on.1193010/,,,,,,,,,,,
nannuky,Narcissism.,"Hey guys! On this site I've read your personality type is 'strongly linked to Narcissistic personality'. Keeping in mind that you're Fe-doms (and that many of you are Twos in Enneagram), it can be shocking to some, and definitely is to me. My ENFJ friend claims he's got NPD and his psychiatrist also assumed that, but he stopped seeing her before she diagnosed him eventually. Either way, what made him almost completely sure that he's a narcissist, was this list of traits. Almost everything was spot on in his case.

So now my questions are:
1) What are your thoughts on the topic? Have you ever suspected yourself to be a narcissist or have you heard from other people that you act like one?
2) To people who know at least one ENFJ - would you say that they do posses traits mentioned in the page above? I wonder how strongly NPD really is linked to this personality type.

oneplustoo,Common ENFJ relationship issues?,"Hey, i'm interested in hearing what relationship problems us ENFJ's have.

My most frustrating issue right now is the conflict that what I think a friend is requires much more involvement then what some of  my ""friends"" think being a friend is. 

I run into the problem that my friends think they can be my friend without ever trying to do anything with me. It annoys me to no end. I feel insulted they dare call me their best friend. For example, I've been told by one of my ""friends"" that I'm their favorite person to hang out with and how much I mean to her, but she never calls me, or invites me to do anything with her. To me, if I was a best friend, she would try to involve me in her life. I'm not a pushy person, but for me to even do anything with this person I have to plan it out myself and it feels like I have to push myself into her life instead of being invited.

I got tired of this and left because I didn't really feel a friendship. She was really heartbroken about it, but still didn't try to come talk to me to resolve it even though she said she would. I've just never had someone so care about me, but not put anything into keeping me in the relationship. I finally did talk to her about 3 months later after I left because she texted me and told me how much I meant to her. I patched things up somewhat, but now it's back to how it was. I don't feel like she's trying to have a relationship even though I'm one of her favorite people in her life. It just doesn't add up. Am I running into a common ENFJ personality type conflict here? help please, I'm trying not to cut off this relationship again to avoid the hurt of thinking and caring about someone, but not being able to help them because they won't let me into their life.

INTJ_female,I need your thoughts on this!,"Hello everyone! There?ôs this one girl in my school that I really like, but she?ôs giving me mixed signals. We?ôve only known each other for 2 months now, because she?ôs not in my class (but I see her quite often though). I will start of by giving some background information. So our relation started off very good; we met at the gym that we both go to, and the first day we met each other, we were literally together all the time at the gym (and we talked and she laughed a lot about things I were saying). After we were finished she told me to add her on Insta. And when I asked her what her name was, I remembered that she had watched some of my past stories; and I didn?ôt know it was her because I didn?ôt know her name (I don?ôt whether she was stalking me or not). And also, one very important thing; we?ôre both girls. So back to the gym. I don?ôt really know what happened in my mind (because I?ôm usually very shy + being and INTJ female doesn?ôt exactly make you a champion in expression of feelings), but I started to become distant towards her. I did this because of the fact that I?ôm lesbian, and I have no idea if she?ôs one too, and all of a sudden I got embarrassed and didn?ôt want her to feel awkward if I showed even a little attraction... And one other reason why is that the when we went home after our first meeting at the gym, the way she said ?úbye??seemed kinda wrong (I know this is just stupid, but that?ôs just how I felt). This was of course a veeery stupid idea of me. On the gym there?ôs like a fitness group (or idk how to call it), and we attend it both of us. Now we?ôve come to the point when we don?ôt communicate at all, but she always gets very close (or next to me) at the fitness groups. Sometimes even behind me, and I also caught her staring at me most of the times while doing the exercises - especially when she?ôs behind me. Sometimes we also arrange ourselves into groups of two; and we?ôre always together (she comes to me too - so she takes the initiative here too). All the times when we?ôre in these groups I catch her doing the exercises in exactly my tempo; doing push-ups, lifting one leg, sit -ups, everything! For example, when we have to lift legs, she already starts with the one I?ôm staring with too. And she gets awfully close (she ?úaccidentally??gets our  workout mats closer. Even when we?ôre doing normal fitness class; last time she was almost so close to me that she could have literally touched me; and it?ôs not even a big class (there?ôs plenty of place). And I always catch her staring at me in the breaks, usually when I?ôm not looking, but I can see her staring + plus there?ôs a mirror which I use lol ? From the first time we met at the gym, I don?ôt even look at her anymore (only when she doesn?ôt she it though). So enough about the fitness ?
I just want to tell something that happened on Friday and yesterday. So we went on a school trip, but only a few of us were going. On Friday (as usual) I caught her staring at me; even some of my friends noticed and forts looked at her then me (as if we were actually flirting). And one other thing that she did is when we had like a guide to guide us through the city; she held hands with another girl (I know they?ôre not together), but she only did that when I could have seen her (especially when I was right behind her). She actually caught me staring at her a couple of times while on the trip, but every single time, I were the one to look away first (because it kinda felt as if she was staring into my soul - she stares very long). And btw, I forgot to mention, at the bus ride I was sitting alone because I get nauseous from sitting further down the bus; she asked me if I would sit with her. But I just said that I get nauseous. So back to the trip. Yesterday we went to some sort of museum and we were two groups. And since me and this girl were not in the same group; her best friend asked me if I would go with her through the city. So we did that, and we got along very 
 well (which IMO is sorta strange because her friends seem to like me - while I?ôm still confused about her. Me and her bf went to the shops, and in one moment her bf decided to call her to go eating (and she said no), but then she said that I?ôm there with her - and she literally came to us in 5 min. That was the first time I were with her since the first time at the gym. And one thing I also noticed, every time she would walk in front of me, she would walk in a different way than usual - kinda like showing off. 
Okay, this was long... So my question is, did I do anything wrong? I?ôm thinking about having a birthday party on Saturday, and maybe invite her. Probably she thinks I hate her, but idk. It?ôs difficult to read her face, because it?ôs always the same, even when talking with friends.

Intj_guy,INTJ seeking thoughts on ENFJ,"So, after doing my homework  (it's our thing) I decided to join and just ask for advice directly regarding my situation: 

There's an ENFJ girl that chased me for months, asking to do things, asking me to take her on dates etc. I finally did and everything just clicked. She would always ask me to things, never the other way around (not for lack of liking her). These were personal things of hers that she's very passionate about (she owns a horse and rides). After a few of these 'dates' and constantly talking she got cold. I would reach out (not overbearing, like once every few days) and the energy shifted. I eventually let it be to see if she would reciprocate and she didn't. I chalked it up as her not being interested anymore and just move on.

6 weeks go by and she makes contact. I joke around and mention her ghosting me and she said she heard I got back with an ex-wife  (we are both recently divorced so we share that as well and understand each other). I told her I would have never chased her (the enfj) if I was going to entertain another woman (the ex). She acts aloof and says she didn't know I was interested that way and gives me the ""you're funny, smart, handsome but I just wanna be friends currently"" line. Ok cool, I know where we stand. I let things go some more, pull back and she invites me to an event with her. We have fun (we both volunteer and it involved that) and grab drinks after. She takes me to her friends and genuinely seems to enjoy our time. We talk for a week straight, mentions things like she'd like me to cook her dinner sometime, we talk about sex and personal things, etc. Then we go weeks without talking again. She invites me to another event, but her gf's are going too. I like them and they like me, all good. We all genuinely seem to get along well. Even if we don't talk and I run into her at the gym she seems very enthusiastic to speak to me (this could just be an enfj thing, or not, idk). Overall, she seems interested in me on some level.

Does this girl like me more than a friend or not?! I'm an aloof INTJ and can figure people out quickly but I'm totally lost in all this. I think it's half the reason why I'm so hooked. She does and says things friends wouldn't do with someone she knows likes her. Personally, if I know a girl likes me and I don't like her back the last thing I would do is invite her to hang out, even with other friends around. We have a lot of common interests as well. I just can't figure it out and I sure as hell don't want to overstep that line after she pulled the friend remark. I think she's confused or wants me to make a move but Idk.

neutralchaotic,Best ways to help ENFJ through a rough patch?,"My ENFJ friend recently shared with me that his mental health hasn't been as great the past few months. It took a while for him to say this to me (I knew something was wrong, but it wasn't until little things he said started slipping in his conversations that I felt it could even be broached between us). We had a one-on-one conversation about this just yesterday, and he really made an effort to be open about things. I'm still worried, though, because he really doesn't have a support network minus one or two people, and he tends to withdraw heavily rather than seek out comfort (when he really needs it). I know him in particular, he doesn't like to ASK for anything out of friendships, but he told me he doesn't receive as much he gives in our friendships. I told him blatantly that I don't feel like I do anything in our friendship, and he told me I do, so I guess my questions are:


what do ENFJs consider as 'friendship' acts? simply time together?
How can I show my ENFJ friend that I can be a listening ear for him?
In what ways can I be proactive during this process, since he doesn't like to ask for help?
It's not my intent to solve his issues for him, but how do I help keep him from slipping deeper within himself?

Thank you for any help. roud:",https://www.personalitycafe.com//threads/best-ways-to-help-enfj-through-a-rough-patch.1181642/,,,,,,,,,,,

neutralchaotic,caught in a flirtationship?,"Without going into a huge amount of detail, I have reason to believe a friendship with an ENFJ friend of mine is not quite as platonic as it used to be. Normally I would chalk this up to his personality, because he's very flirty in nature, but I can't shake the feeling that he's not entirely clowning around, because his statements pertaining to romance / relationships / dating (and this happens in 9 out of 10 conversations we have) always specifically describe traits and experiences of mine, and he has zero trouble calling me his fake girlfriend though I know he told me he's done with people for now. ..we also speak the least (relative) out of our friend group, but I've only seen him be stronger with his flirting when it comes to me. 

The catch is I think we both know we have some compatibility issues (he made a specific comment that touched on a reason I'm hesitant to move forward with him). On top of that, I'm still sorting out my feelings for him (the physical attraction is most definitely there, however), so I'm not sure of the best way to approach this. Could I stay silent, since he seems to be reading my mind and emotions quite well so far?

artofbalance,Turning Off Feelings?,"Hi awesome ENFJs!

I noticed that anytime I leave my ENFJ, he turns off his feelings? It's almost like kisses and hugs become practical instead of emotionally filled when they normally are lovey/passionate. Which confuses me? Can someone explain why?

Also, when I say things like, ""I miss you!"" or ""Thinking about you!"" (we are in a ldr), he doesn't really reciprocate. He immediately goes, ""Hey you!!!..."" almost changing the mood.

Would really love some help figuring this out. I could also ask him, but would love some help on how to ask without hurting his feelings or having him feel like I'm attacking him.

FreeSpirit777,Ruining Things at my job?,"So I recently got a new job yesterday; it's a better fit for me with more hours than my previous job.. which i still have by the way, because i enjoy it it small bursts and i just like helping out when they need me..

 I had it in my mind that if i got hired by this new job, that i would tell my other job that i would prefer to be taken off the schedule, and only be ""on-call""... like they call me on short notice to see if i could come in.. or i want some hours, so i call my department manager, and she gives me one shift or two..

 This has actually been the case for the past few weeks.. i wouldn't be scheduled, then I'd call my dept manager, this younger girl around my age, and she'd put me on a night shift.. one day this guy called in sick, so this dept manager called me and asked if i could come in..

 So yesterday i had my job interview, and they hired me.. so as planned, i went straight to my old job to find my dept manager and tell her my new availability preference.. she wasn't there, so i talked to the assistant store manager.. she's actually really nice and we get along much better than the store manager and i.. she's kinda on the employees side, and stands up for them and doesn't act like a macho boss lady..

 anyways, when i told her that I'm busy and prefer to be off the schedule and only come in if i call them, or they call me.. she said casually, ""if it ain't broke don't fix it!"".. she also said she wasn't sure if I'd be able to do this.. i then told her I'd talk to the store manager tomorrow, since my dept manager isn't here this weekend..

 So today i came in, talked to my manager, told her the same thing i told the assistant manager.. and she then said ""why don't you just call it quits?"", and she then went on to explain how this job isn't a good fit for me etc, how i don't do my job etc.. her and i have REALLY butt heads so often, more than any manager I've ever had. She does not like me! I'm always extremely polite and respectful and sensitive, but she is still a harsh lady, definitely an ESTJ all the way, so you can see the conflict we have!!

 Anyways, i told her that I'm not looking to quit.. and had to kinda plead with her a bit to not fire me.. she then said that she would put me as a ""seasonal employee"", which at first i thought meant after the holidays I'm gone.. but apparently it means just what i wanted; that they call me if they need me, or i do if i want hours. So I'm a permanent employee, I'm just not scheduled regularly unless they need extra help, someone calls in etc..

 After all this, it really stressed me out a bit because i felt like i did more damage then if i didn't say anything.. 
 But at the same time, if i said nothing, then I'd be scheduled probably on a day that conflicts with my other job, and I'd have to cancel and i hate not being available to help out.

 I figured maybe i should've just waited until my department manager came in, and talked to her privately about it.. let her know to take me off the schedule and only call me if necessary/if i call for hours.. but then again, everyone gossips so she probably would've told the store manager.

 I just really don't want to lose this job. I like keeping my options open with two jobs.",https://www.personalitycafe.com//threads/ruining-things-at-my-job.1167578/,,,,,,,,,,,
InkMyUmbrella,Do I use Fe?,"Hi! I am in the process of figuring out what type I am. ENFJ was not something I considered originally, but I find that I do relate to a lot of descriptions of the function order. The thing is, I am still very confused about the difference between Fi and Fe in the concrete world, even though I've read dozens of articles on the distinction.

From a VERY young age, I was concerned with being well-liked. I was always interested in maintaining friendships, always wanting to be one of the popular kids...But for some reason, was rejected by many of my peers since a young age. I was lucky though, because a girl on the second day of a new school in first grade came and asked me to be my friend and of course I accepted. 

But she was the type who made friends, it seems, with anyone, especially the social loners; she made us sit with the most unpopular boy in the class during lunch. I hated it because everyone else would judge us. I did not want him around. So, the days when she was at home sick and not in school, I would try to ditch him and sit at another table. 

This obsession with ""popularity"" continued even to my college years. I wanted to appear like I was part of the crowd. I would make decisions, sometimes really short-sighted ones, just because I was so concerned with how others perceived me. 

It's only recently, tired of my depression due to my struggle at creating social relationships, that I began trying to accept and revel at the theory that maybe I am just really, really weird. And I should make friends with more weird people. however, I still enjoy it when I'm out and about and another person and I see someone acting out of the social norm, and we exchange that side glance of ""Wow, what a weirdo"". It makes me feel accepted.


So yeah, hopefully you can understand my dilemma! XD Does this resonate with you Fe-doms, or would you say this isn't how you process the social world?",https://www.personalitycafe.com//threads/do-i-use-fe.1165377/,,,,,,,,,,,

1 - do you trust your gut, in general?
2 - in the first moments (first conversations, hangouts, dates) of meeting someone and becoming interested in them (romantically), how far do you trust your gut? 
3 - how do conceptualize this whole ""gut instinct"" idea? How do you understand it?

Ethanol,"ENFJ, bad at communicating?","Hi lovelies :wink:

My ENFJ boyfriend and I are struggling a bit in our relationship. As strange as it seems, as an INFJ, I have spent the past 6 years studying MBTI (particularly of INFJs) so that I can work on my weaknesses (shutting down, not communicating, hiding away etc...) so that I can become a better and more well rounded INFJ and ultimately capable of a long term relationship.

I have matured a lot trying to understand my own subconscious motivations and able to curb a lot of self-destructive and relationship-destructive behaviors. Particularly my tendency to shut down or hide away or keep my feelings locked up inside, or burn bridges. 

I've matured a lot in my views of love and life. I believe that loving someone basically comes down to a choice and a commitment; so it's important to be picky but not idealistic. I see that many INFJs have very idealized views of love, echoing MBTI statistics that show xNFJs are the most dissatisfied in their relationships. I do realize and have accepted that my idealization has caused many dissatisfactions when faced with the realities that people are imperfect and love imperfectly. 

In all honesty, my imperfect self can't expect perfection from others - it's unrealistic. I've spent the past few years becoming very realistic about my expectations in love, but also in trying to become the kind of person that I would be willing to date. Someone who chooses to commit, fight to stay together, lovr, someone who is willing to change behavior to make others happy (not values).

I'm much more self-aware than I use to be, and because of this, I'm able to clearly communicate meaningful  information to my significant other about my inner-workings so that they know what I need/want. Sometimes couples can talk and talk without actually addressing the root of the problems.

My boyfriend, ENFJ (type 6), has a difficult time communicating with me on some deeper issues. He will say something is wrong in a vague manner without being able to pinpoint what it is. I've started to notice that this has become an issue in our relationship when he is unhappy with something I've done - he tends to shut down or pull away. I also know that when he does this, his thoughts tend to spiral into negativity, and so I always reach out to him and ask him to speak to me so that we can talk it out. Often, I've had to be the mediating voice between his feelings and the facts.

I love him a lot, and when he pisses me off sometimes it's difficult to be loving, I still choose to do the loving thing  :laughing:

I find him to be skittish sometimes, where if he sees something wrong in our relationship, he begins to question the whole relationship. I feel like he bases those judgements on his feelings instead of the facts. There is a tendency to catastrophize everything. I'm usually the one having to be the logical voice and interjecting with all the positives of our relationships, and truthfully 90% is perfect and 10% is problematic. The 10% problematic stuff has more to do with my Ni+Ti thoughts, he struggles with it. 

Today, after we talked, we were finally able to pin down... Mr. ENFJ said he doesn't feel like I ""get"" him, and then also said that not a lot of people ""get"" him. I responded with a ""If I don't get you, then try your best to explain things to me and I'll try my best to understand"". I told him that I had a willing heart, and if he would work with me, that eventually I'll begin to understand him more. In our relationship, I've had to explain myself ALOT because I wanted him to understand me; I don't expect others to ""get me"" automatically except for other INFJs and even then rarely do other INFJs understand unless they have had very similar or identical pasts. I just see it as part of life, but I think my boyfriend wants that kind of connection with me and I feel bad that I can't provide that for him? UGH! 

I'm learning that I have to be extra extra Fe. I'm an INFJ, I feel like I'm Fe-enough, but I guess with Fe-dom, it's not enough? My ENFJ-6 has had a tough past, and I think in many ways, he actually doesn't know himself enough to curb some of the behavior that is destructive to our relationship. I've addressed this with him many times, about his non-communication, etc... 

I've just noticed that my ENFJ-6 boyfriend has a tendency to expect me to just know him without him ever having to explain his motivations. I'm an INFJ, I'm not a mind reader :frustrating:

Being an ENFJ, I thought for sure he would be much more meaningfully communicative, but in our relationship I'm finding the opposite to be true and that's a first for me :shocked: 

What's the problem here? I thought ENFJs were great at communicating? What else can I do to make our relationship better? Any suggestions? I need some help.

I know there are alot of single ENFJs out there, and I wonder if our xNFJ singleness has a lot to do with our idealism or lack of understanding about our motivations or something? I don't know, I'm trying really hard here but struggling *sigh*

PS: I love my ENFJ to death, and I don't want to lose him :blushed:",https://www.personalitycafe.com//threads/enfj-bad-at-communicating.1051929/,,,,,,,,,,,

BlueDahlia,Advice request: I got married and did not tell my E/INFJ friend,"For the past several years, I've had a professional relationship with an E/INFJ male who started out as a mentor for me.  When we first met, he helped me navigate a challenging period in my life/career and was constantly available to provide empathy, support, and advice and to serve as a sounding board for my ideas.  I've expressed to him how deeply I appreciated his support, and we maintained contact even after he moved to a different state (partially at his request).  He told me that he was emotionally invested in my well-being and success and has urged me on several occasions to visit him.

I have always been unsure how to classify our interaction.  We stayed in touch because I reached out to him to provide an update every so often, but he was not the type to initiate contact.  Also, he occupies a top executive role, which makes it difficult to picture myself as a friend or equal.  (For example, I had to make an appointment with his secretary weeks in advance to talk to him by phone.)  Because of these factors, I have tried to maintain a professional distance and have resisted becoming close personally.

I recently got married but did not bother to tell my mentor/friend until it came up in a conversation months later.  He was clearly upset when he found out.  In hindsight, I made a terrible mistake by not opening up about this personal information because I probably made him feel like I don't value him as a close confidant.  (Also, he was aware that I had a long-term boyfriend and has been trying to convince me for years that the relationship would hurt my career.)

Is there anything I can do to make him feel better and repair our relationship?  Would it make him happier if I treat him more like a close friend or a professional mentor?

MozzarellaStick,Does my ENFJ male friend have feelings for me?,"Hello ENFJs, INFJ female here! I've been quite confused about the behavior of my ENFJ friend and I have no idea how to interpret how he's acting which is why I'm hoping y'all would be able to offer some insight. To give some background information, this ENFJ dude and I have been friends for about a year. A mutual friend introduced us and we've been friends ever since. However, for a good few months, he was in a very unhealthy relationship that directly affected how he treated his other friends. Because of this, the two of us almost stopped being friends. 

Since he broke off the unhealthy relationship, however, him and I have been closer than ever. For the last 4 months or so, we've been texting pretty much every day without fail and he's usually the one who initiates the conversations (I used to initiate more of the conversations, but its gotten to the point where he texts me so much that I don't have a chance to text him first XD). Anyways, these last few months we've become closer friends than we ever were before and he tells me almost everything. He tells me every little thing that excites him or saddens him. He tells me a lot of personal things about himself that I never knew about him before, and I have the impression that this is stuff that he doesn't really tell anyone about. He's always been encouraging to me and kind, but not overbearing to the point where I'd suspect that he likes me more than a friend.

However, just this past week, he's been acting quite different and giving me reason to believe that he may have some hidden feelings for me. My suspicions began when I invited him to a ceremony that I would be singing at. Although he knows that this is very important to me, I figured that he wouldn't be able to fit it into his schedule. He's a very busy person and he lives 2+ hours a way. In addition to this, he's always had trouble making plans when myself and other friends have wanted to get together in the past. Because of this, I was shocked when he basically told me (in his own ENFJ way) that he would do everything he can to make sure he can come and he'll prioritize this event over everything else going on in his life. Now, I thought this was really really sweet because I've never had a friend prioritize me like this before. However, I still suspected he was just being his friendly ENFJ self. Well, I started questioning his feelings when he asked me about how an event was going that I briefly mentioned to him in conversation weeks prior. Now, as an INFJ, i remember almost everything that people tell me, but even I wouldn't remember to ask a friend how something went that was mentioned so casually in conversation. This tells me that I was obviously on his mind. 

The following evening I really started to think about his behavior towards me. I was quite insistent that there was no way he had feelings for me, but still thought his behavior was quite odd. So, I started reading forums on here to try to figure out what this meant. Sure enough, I read that all these things are signs that an ENFJ likes you. So, I started doing research on more signs that they like you. He does nearly every single one to me. He opens up to me, prioritizes me, seems to want to share his whole life with me, and he's insanely overly protective of me. When I though about the situation more, I realized that over the past week or so, he's been about ten times more kind and encouraging towards me and he's gone out of his way to help me way more than he usually would. 

Now, here's what I'm confused about. He's the type of guy who will develop a crush on pretty much any kind girl who shows him interest. Because of this, it seemed pretty strange to me that he's never liked me in the past as I'm an almost perfect example of the type of girls he usually goes for. However, at the time that I met him, he was interested in two different girls, so I figured it was just because of the timing of everything that he never saw me as more than a friend. Since I also read somewhere that if an ENFJ doesn't like someone romantically when they first meet them, they most likely will never feel that way, I'm very confused as to why it seems as if this ENFJ friend could be developing feelings for me now. Like I said, we've been friends for a year, and although we've just recently gotten much closer, it still doesn't make much sense as to why he may like me now, but never did in the past. The other thing that I'm confused about is the fact that there is, technically, another girl in the picture. It's neither of the two girls that he liked when he first met me, but he does seem to be developing feelings for her. He does talk to me about her occasionally, but it seems as if he hasn't gotten to the point where he's really interested in her yet. However, a very similar situation occurred when he liked our mutual friend and another girl.

I'm just very confused because he seems to be sending signals that he likes me, but yet I have reason to believe otherwise. He's also being pretty hot and cold with me. The best way that I can explain his actions is that he's being 10x more overly sweet and encouraging towards me, but yet sometimes he doesn't seem as interested in talking to me as he used to. But then again, he has mentioned that he's been very busy so it could just be that. I'd just really like to understand better what his behavior means and if it's possible that he does have some feelings for me. But, if he does like me, he seems to not want to be obvious about it, although he's not doing a very good job. Although I'm not quite sure how I feel about him, I can guarantee you that he doesn't think I like him that way and probably believes that he wouldn't have a chance with me.

Malcolm_fleX,Dating a Broken ENFJ Woman,"Ok guys, so this one is going to be a bit of a long one. Just a fair disclaimer for those who might be clicking onto this. I've got plenty of story to tell, however, out of respect for the subject, I'll be being very vague.



So I'm an ENTP first off,  and a pretty well-developed one, I would say. Not to toot my own horn or anything, but it is what it is. Anyways, I've got a fairly long sexual history, but I put it all away to be with this one woman who is indeed 6 years older than me, however, arguably when it comes to maturity, I'm fairly certain that I win out. 



To be succinct on this post, this woman has been through a HELL OF A LOT. 3 Kids with the fathers nowhere near in the picture,  several broken relationships w/ abuse and or manipulation. A family that's no longer involved etc. So that has taken it's toll on her. Nonetheless, she is still a mentally, physically, and emotionally beautiful woman at her best. 

Unfortunately, a few weeks after we started dating, a lot of things happened in her life which set her back TREMENDOUSLY and also brought up a stressful image of the woman that I knew. (This stressed version of her still has not went anywhere and her children and I notice it constantly.) Luckily we got through ALL of those problems that arose with the exception of her car. (She has been car-less for weeks now.) We moved in together, a move, of which I thought would set things on the right course. Unfortunately for us, things haven't improved.

Ok, now that I have provided some context to this post, it's time to really preface with some details on our relationship.

- We have been dating for 13-14 weeks. Of which, throughout that time, I've made SEVERAL changes to my lifestyle to accommodate (per her desire), in not letting my parents be anywhere NEAR as intrusive into my personal life as they have been, cutting off and avoiding much contact with other females in professional and casual contexts. (I don't interact much with women anyways, despite the fact that they flirt with me often.)



- I've softened up QUITE a bit giving her warm affirmations often, proclaiming my love for her as well as undying dedication to building with her, and going the extra mile in arguments to avoid being my typical asshole self. These are HUGE changes for me as they're quite contradictory to my normal and non-romantic self, however, I'm not quite dismayed or even put off by this. I have no compunctions about this, except for the fact that she STILL doubts, whether or not I'm entirely faithful, care about her, and at times even want to be in a relationship despite SEVERAL conversations and arguments about this as well as me having gone the extra mile to show through actions (helping out and mentoring as well as doing some providing for her kids, letting her have a fingerprint on my phone to which she typically uses to look through it constantly citing that she is just being 'nosy' etc.) I've never been unfaithful or even given off any sort of signs of infidelity. Still, this is just leftover trauma from past relationships, a lot of which she has even told me, that she isn't used to someone being in love with her or being willing to do anything to make her happy. Her rationale for this is that she is afraid of us getting far, and eventually leaving her to find someone younger or more educated. These are things that I've told her constantly, ""I don't care about, and love her as a person."" Keep in mind, we've had this SAME convo SEVERAL TIMES, and a lot of the time, when we have issues, it goes back to this.


- She goes through moments where she will get REALLY annoyed and irate, lashing out and saying anything, regardless of how hurtful. These are typically very stressful moments where everything builds, and it's hard to even get through to her during these times. She is very perfectionistic and OCD at normal times, so during this period, that is ramped up 1000 fold. Despite this, she's very sensitive and regardless of how mad she gets, reciprocating or even slightly raising my voice is typically met with questions like ""Why are you mad?"" or ""Why are you yelling at me?"" She always puts up mental barriers when I try to defuse the situation, by pointing out how I nor anyone gets what she is going through, even when I do and have told her circumstances in my life which have mirrored or even trumped her situation. Nonetheless, her listening can be pretty sparse when she gets like this so it's almost impossible to help her. I have gotten moments where I've lost my cool as of recently and stormed out to clear my head, and I've even told her of this being my way of avoiding saying something that I may regret, but she chastises it as being childish. There's almost no winning in this situation as when I leave, I'm blamed for walking out when things get bad, when I stay, I either fight back or have to sit there and take it.



- She's very ENFJ as she is used to and gets annoyed when she can't take care of someone else. She isn't used to having someone do something for her, and with me, I'm used to working and being the workhorse so when I default to that, she doesn't know how to take it. She is constantly worried about my parents believing she is ""using"" me despite the fact that I've told her that I don't care what they think and neither should she. There are times when she'll get outright angry that I won't let her do something for me, even when it's clear she is worn out. There isn't much balance here because I also can't just sit around and appear to be lazy, despite the fact that this is what I aim to avoid as I hate the idea of being the man that comes back from work and does nothing but sits down while the woman does ALL the work.




-  She goes through the ""I'm fat"" or ""I'm old"" phase quite a lot despite me telling her otherwise and giving more affirmations. (She is actually small and pretty damn hot if I do say so myself. She could pass for 18-19.) It gets pretty bad when coupled with the insecurity that I'm younger and she believes I'll eventually leave her for someone younger. (I definitely wouldn't). That much almost makes her do a whole defensive routine where she is always assuming I'm looking at someone different or possibly thinking about someone else. Because of that, she says that she can't fully let go or get 100% involved because she thinks she'll get dependent and I'll be gone. She also works in a workplace that tends to be really messy in terms of people's interactions with each other, which only bolsters this fear as she seems to internalize what she see's from guys and/or women in her workplace and reflect that onto me. Perhaps this is overactive Fe at work?



- Now, one thing that I DO have a question for is that she hates it when people do something for her and then throw it in her face that they did it for her, usually in an attempt to get something from her or subjugate her. Now I hate this too, so I'd never do it, however, when she does something or claims I don't really care about her, and I bring up what I've done (NOT in an attempt to get something from her, but to tell her how my actions back up my loyalty to her.) Most recently, I used an example to show her how she was doing the same thing to me that someone in her workplace did to her, and apparently that was the last straw as she said that she would never trust me with information ever again. Now, I didn't see this as doing, that, but moreso just using an example that she could relate to as an attempt to build empathy, but apparently it wasn't taken that way. 



- I'm at a loss as to what to do because it seems like every night it's something that will just set her off and create a new argument moment. Even the most innocuous things like innocent jokes and asides are perceived as attacks now and I literally feel like I'm walking on egg shells at any given moment. I default to just being quiet now when the moment gets tense as I don't want to say anything that's  out of line, but even THAT has started to annoy her so I'm again in a lose-lose here. There are plenty of times where if I simply ask why she's mad or tell her what she's doing she'll default to shutting me out by saying, ""Maybe we should just end it right here so you don't have to be with someone who is _______________"" even when I don't even come CLOSE to implying this.   

- At the end of most of our talks she admits that it's not even me, but it's just something wrong with her, and that she needs help because of what she has been through. It's left her damaged and created an almost PTSD situation for her. She's even informed me about her mood swings from time to time. (often) She always thanks me for my understanding and the fact that I've literally been everything she could ever have wanted and she just can't believe that I'm real because it's so shocking to finally feel loved. She tells me that she's afraid and doesn't know how, to be happy yet and for me to work through this with her, yet when she gets angry, all of this goes out the window.... It leaves me confused and puzzled as to what to do. I'm normally a dick to anyone who wrongs me, but I can't bring myself to not treat her like a queen. The only thing is, it doesn't get me very far, but it's all I can even make myself do. 



I just don't know what to do honestly. I'm not looking to break up with her because for all the issues I've listed, (and there are more.) If I were to talk about the good and the positives in her personality, I'd be talking for days because she literally has THAT much upside. I'm just not sure at the moment how much longer we can last with her going through these swings. I want to be with this woman for life, but not THIS version of her. I can deal with it, but it takes a toll on me, and personally I'm already a very negative and pessimistic person, but when I'm with her, that goes away and I'm just positive and happy. This isn't to say I'm dependent on her for happiness as I tend to be more of a loner and am fine by myself, however, the ecstasy of a relationship with someone you genuinely love is seldom and I'd rather not lose that if I could help it. 



So my question is, is this simply an unhealthy ENFJ that will get better, or does this sound like some long-term non-personality based issue that may never go away.",https://www.personalitycafe.com//threads/dating-a-broken-enfj-woman.1129378/,,,,,,,,,,,
drizzy lake,ESTJ mother,"Fe Ni Se Ti vs Te Si Ne Fi

First there is the obvious S vs N clash. My whole family is pretty much sensors only so this has always been apparent and leading to feel different, but whatever, there's also the even more important dom-Te vs Fe clash. Combine that with being Ti last and she Fi last, meaning my T function is my achilles verse and  her F function hers, yea...
Like I said, theres already the N-S problem. My older sister is an ESFJ, so there was the same Te|Fe problem, but they atleast clashed on like the same level. With me and my mother it feels like that clash is supported by an inherent misunderstanding problem.
Then theres Fi and Ti last. She's emotional for an ESTJ, but you can tell that does not mean she has a good healthy relation to her inferior function. Her being Enneagram 6 does not help. Her Fi manifests in feeling often like she's the victim and not seeing the real extend of her control tendensies. 
When I showed her MBTI its funny that she thought my sister is the ESTJ and she the ESFJ, cause she does not see herself as a thinking type (she also saw herself as N and not S but thats just cuz she doesnt know shit basically about the system; shes so clearly sensor/Si its not funny and the E6 anxiety may seem like intuition to her). She feels emotionally justified in her behavior. It makes so much sense that she thinks shes a Feeling type cause she lacks self awareness of her driving judging function.

So yea, what are your experiences with ESTJs and your advises in general? My father being an ISTJ is obvs not much help. The problems I have with him are different but similar; hes not controlling or anything but theres still a clear misunderstanding on a fundamental basis.",https://www.personalitycafe.com//threads/estj-mother.1129850/,,,,,,,,,,,

takkenne,ENFJ in the Spotlight,"Type descriptions say ENFJ's are one of the types who really know how to work a crowd. I wondered if anyone's noticed some contradictions in this?

I think if an ENFJ is in a position of leadership (teacher, hostess, etc), they relish their role. They love the clarity of the assignment, love talking to everyone in the room, love the performance. However, in big groups where they are not the designated leader, ENFJ's are different. While they're extroverted in small groups, I find the bigger the group, the more the ENFJ will sink into the background--watching, often laughing, but they shy away from the spotlight.

I think it's that the larger the group, the more likely it is that there is someone more extroverted than the ENFJ. If there is someone more extroverted, the ENFJ immediately defers. But if there's a room full of 15 socially awkward introverts, the ENFJ has no problem stepping up and leading the group. I'm sure there are some ENFJ's who always take the lead role, but I've noticed enough doing otherwise to justify this post.

Anyone else noticed this or am I crazy lol",https://www.personalitycafe.com//threads/enfj-in-the-spotlight.1100489/,,,,,,,,,,,

justorian,ENFJ and the Hatred of Justification,"Okay, as an ENFJ I constantly find myself justifying my beliefs and such in a debate with another person. It gets really tiring... I have to have a come back for everything and I can never drop it until I feel like I have won, and it would be so much easier to just be able to drop it.

What are your thoughts as an ENFJ and having to stand up for what you think is right all the time?

e.g. a friend and I got into a small argument because I was talking about how thinking about being a neurosurgeon really gets me excited and makes me want to jump with joy, and they ask me why. That is where it all begins, with the why - and that's when I know I'm about to have a 45-minute discourse over why the job is much better than the rest and why he is wrong to think otherwise. I talk about how it's a job for selfless people who want to help everyone around them all day every day... he says that people only do it for the huge paychecks, I say that neurosurgeons spend most of the day working and the rest of the day sleeping, he asks why I would do it then if the only real pay is knowing you're helping others... you can see where this becomes repetitive and tiring. Don't get me wrong, I love a good debate; but only when the topic is worth debating over. Why do people have to ask so many questions regarding pointless topics such as why I named my dog Rocky? Does it even matter? Even if it doesn't, I will still debate to have it my way.",https://www.personalitycafe.com//threads/enfj-and-the-hatred-of-justification.1122490/,,,,,,,,,,,
mninp,Can't tell if this ENFJ woman at work likes me,"I'm pretty sure she's an ENFJ but she could also be an ESFJ...it's hard to tell.  I'm leaning towards ENFJ because I have had a few conversations with her and we were in sync a lot...she just reminded me of what I think the ENFJ type would be like.  But I don't know her that well personally so I don't have a lot to go off of.  I know for a 100% fact she's an E and an F, and I'm like 90% sure she's a J, but I'm betting she's not too far off from P.  She told me her biggest pet peeve is people's messes and she loses her mind when things get messy.  I've also seen her react pretty strongly to certain arguments.  Both of these pretty much suggest J.  However, her base personality is so laid back.  She's charming, she smiles a lot, she's always happy, always talking to everybody, her social skills are so good that it's almost intimidating.  Again she could be a sensor, but I felt like her and I clicked in an N type way instead of the typical disconnect you may get between a sensor and an intuitive.  Like I said I could be wrong though.

Anyway...every time she sees me for the first time of the day, she winks at me.  Literally every day.  The first time I spoke to her I mentioned that I wasn't feeling good and she asked me all these types of questions like what did I eat, what time I went to sleep, how much water I drank, etc...yeah it was insane.  But I like that 

Sometimes she touches me lightly on the arm when she's talking to me, but it could just be a friendly touch I'm not sure.  Like I said she's an extremely friendly person so she may do this to other people too.  Sometimes she'll help me with something on the computer and when she does, she leans over me and her face gets really close to mine, and she'll turn and talk to me from this distance.  If I ask her to help me out with something, she'll do the whole thing for me and walk me through each step.

Today at work I was on the computer and I was talking to a few co workers in a casual setting (they were standing) and she came over and sat on my desk and started talking to the group as a whole.  

Sometimes her and I will debate about psychology and we go really in depth with it.  Not sure how important this is but I added it.

In any ordinary situation I would be thinking that she definitely likes me, but because she's so friendly to everybody and open, I'm afraid that she might just have a flirtatious personality and I'm reading it all wrong.  Maybe she's just a touchy-feely kind of person who winks in a friendly way and isn't bothered by personal space and whatnot.  I keep giving myself excuses about it because I feel like the fact that I like her is making my mind over interpret every little thing she does.

Anyway, put yourself in her shoes as far as I've described and let me know what you think.  Whether she's ENFJ or ESFJ I don't think it would be much different.",https://www.personalitycafe.com//threads/cant-tell-if-this-enfj-woman-at-work-likes-me.1122634/,,,,,,,,,,,
Ethanol,ENFJ and Sex,"OH boy! Here we go :laughing:
I've come from a long hiatus to yet again, discover more about the inner workings of ENFJs :tongue:
I'm curious about ENFJ and Sex. I'm struggling to form a question here because I don't have a particular question, just a desire to understand what makes ENFJs  tick sexually :frustrating: There's the problem of, every ENFJ having different desires? So to cover this topic generally... how to phrase this question... mmmmhh.

If you had to create your ideal sexual partner in terms of their attitude (let's forget physique LOL) what would it be and why? Please be as detailed as possible but also try to perhaps self-reflect on why you believe it works for you.

I can say this being an INFJ and Ni-dom... I've read a lot about how an INFJ's sexual experience is spiritual, and I don't know if I necessarily agree with that. I think, the best way to sum up an INFJ's sexual experience isn't so much that it's spiritual but rather that the experience itself is magnified by the intensity of a soul-to-soul connection with the person they have fallen in love with? So the deeper the bond, the more pleasurable and exciting sex 'can' become. Trust I believe is a huge factor for INFJs, but also on the complete opposite spectrum... with INFJ's having inferior Se, if an INFJ is on an Se-binge they can be an animal. I think how this manifests itself in a relationship for an INFJ is that most INFJs are kind of like caged sexual beasts - waiting a lifetime for that special person who willingly locks themselves in and play with us for eternity :laughing: (Did I give away an INFJ secret? WHOOPS! LOL)

I often view sex, as the mechanical (body), the mind, and then the emotional/relational (you could say is 'spiritual' but I think of it more as a level of trust that allows one to 'let go' of the world and get lost for a moment and then fall back into the arms of someone special instead of just falling). 

Often times I think of casual sex as mechanical, and sometimes if the person you're with is creative enough (engages your mind) you maybe can get off if you can let go of your inhibitions entirely (I don't think most INFJs can). Even if they're not the most engaged mentally, if you're able to stimulate your own mind, you can make it work too (IE: just using each others bodies to get off). I think the emotional/relational aspect is what throws the experience to a new level.

Being Ni-dom, I've noticed that sex is most enjoyable if it engages, at the very least the body and mind. If the brain is not engaged, everything seems to fall flat. If relational aspect is copacetic, then it's a dream come true for any INFJ. 

Since ENFJs and INFJs share the same cognitive functions in a slightly different order, I wonder a lot about how an ENFJ gets the most out of sex? Being a Fe-dominant, do you feel that ENFJs get off on sex slightly differently from other MBTI types? I wonder how Fe-dominant plays into the whole thing or if it has nothing to do with it at all. I wonder if Fe is extra focused on the other person where as Ni-dom is more focused on the idea of something happening.

I'm hoping that I'm making some sense here  I've been thinking about this alot, and I just wonder... sometimes I think INFJs being Ni-dom can get off on what's happening instead of necessarily being entirely in the moment. It's like, the 'idea' of it is enough to work it's magic. Where as I wonder if Fe is more focused on the give and take in that moment? How the person is looking at you, how you're making them feel which in turn is making you feel? Etc... 

So, quick overview:
1) If you had to create your ideal sexual partner in terms of their attitude (let's forget physique LOL) what would it be and why? Please be as detailed as possible but also try to perhaps self-reflect on why you believe it works for you.

2) How does Fe-dom affect your Sex life?

3) Do you feel that ENFJs get off on sex slightly differently from other MBTI types?

They need to talk a lot about their feelings in order to get them into perspective
They are uncomfortable with change and do not usually adapt well to new situations
EFJ Learning StyleEFJ children usually enjoy going to school, because it meets many of their natural needs. They always find people to interact with at school and they enjoy the structured environment. They are usually responsible and hard working students, although their interest in being social may cause them to be easily distracted in the classroom.An EFJ's need to constantly interact with others makes it difficult for them to sit quietly and do a project on their own. They greatly prefer group projects, and usually do better when they can talk through their ideas and tasks out loud with others. If an EFJ is allowed to work with a friend rather than working alone, he or she will almost always be happier and more productive.
EFJs have a strong need for harmony and are quickly unsettled by conflict. They need to feel that their teacher likes them in order to be able to function well in a given class. If the child and teacher have not formed a bond, the EFJ child may assume that the teacher does not like them. A teacher should take a few extra moments to get to know the EFJ child, and let the child know that they are glad to have them in their class.
EFJs are most comfortable when the rules and expectations are spelled out clearly. Before they can complete any task or assignment, they will want to have a plan. If the task is not already planned out, they need to have the rules and goals clearly defined so that they can create a plan.
EFJ Special NeedsFinding a way to discipline their EFJ without crushing their spirit will be a difficult task for many parents. EFJ children are hyper-sensitive to criticism, and can be completely disable by punishment. Parents can diminish the need to punish their EFJ children by clearing defining the rules and expectations for the child's behavior. Rules should be enforced consistently and as kindly as possible. If you need to discipline your child, make sure that they know that you are doing it for their own good, and that you still love them.
Parents and teachers of EFJ children should give them positive feedback as often as possible. Some Thinking adults often do not express love or admiration. They believe that their kids know how they feel, so it's not necessary to express themselves over and over again. Feeling children need to hear the feedback. If an adult doesn't give them any feedback at all, this is often equal to negative feedback in the Feeling child's mind.
EFJ children feel things intensely and passionately. They will carry this trait with them throughout their lives. It's important that they're not made to feel guilty or foolish for having such strong feelings. Some well-meaning parents might not want their children to have such emotional reactions to situations, and may try to downplay their children's feelings. That is a mistake. EFJ children will grow into EFJ adults, and nothing will change that. However, the EFJ's parents will influence the child's general happiness and effectiveness throughout their lives. Parents should encourage their EFJ children to share their feelings, and should listen to them without harsh judgment.
EFJs love to be socially active and feel like part of a group. They also thrive on opportunities to help others. These attributes are some of the strongest that they will have to offer in their lives. To encourage their healthy development, EFJs should be encouraged to participate in group activites like Girl Scouts or Boy Scouts. They will also benefit from organized religion and community volunteer work. Team sports are an excellent outlet for their abundant physical energy, as well as their social needs.
EFJs are uncomfortable with change, and will probably approach an unknown situation with caution and reserve. Parents and caregivers should give their EFJ time to adjust to the idea rather than pushing them. Helping the EFJ child to see the new situation within the context of something that the EFJ has already experienced will help them adjust.
The ""Missing"" LetterAdult personality types contain four letters, while for kids aged 7-12 we use three letter types. What happened to the missing letter? It's there, we just can't usually determine what it is until after a person is 13 years old. EFJ kids will grow up to be either ESFJ ""Caregivers"" or ENFJ ""Givers"". At this stage in their development, it's not obvious whether they will choose Intuition or Sensing to complement their Feeling preference. You will see the child practicing both Intuition and Sensing as they settle down into their preferred function. In some children, it's possible to distinguish their ""missing"" letter, but for many kids we just have to wait a few years to be sure.",https://www.personalitycafe.com//threads/enfj-childhood-personality-portrait.128641/,,,,,,,,,,,

joabloab,Is it just me? Or are ENFJs extremely similar to ESTPs/ISTPs in communication,"I am undoubtedly an ENFJ, who would probably lay my stack in ease of communication with other types as: 

INFJ>ISTP>ESTP

I'm sure its not a coincidence, considering we have the same exact functional orientations. I think it's the human nature to prefer to be around those who are similar to them when they go through tough times. I find that I need to get away from SJs and even NFs when I feel that I am misunderstood the most. Me and my ESTP friend seem to always finish each-others sentences, its almost disturbing. We obviously have our differences, like when it comes to value judgements. But overall I find that above any other type, I always seem to follow the STPs train of thought, with no confusion. ISTPs are my favorite, because they even more frequently recognize my point of view. 

I think overall, I prefer the company of STPs because they challenge me intellectually (from a practical standpoint). Even when they make the most crude comments, somehow I see where it came from.

henryforlani,ENTP (me) starting to Fall To An ENFJ girl with Gay Friend Giving Me Mixed Signals,"Context: We are workmates (I know, don't shit where you eat but I am willing to take some risk just so because I know I can get away with it).

Basically, our team is composed of 5 men (3 of them are married, me and another guy are single). Last January, this girl came from a different project together with her gay workmate (they are in the same project before).

To add substance, the ENPJ girl is an HB7 and her gay friend is an HB4. Like 5'4, around 200 pounds, dark skin, but is very kind and agrees to whatever she says and pleases. The gay guy does not get mad, angry, etc. You can literally make a personal joke about him and he will just take it.

Girl's story: She had her heart broken by a guy more than a year ago. I saw her ex's picture (he is heterosexual). She also said this breakup has no closure and she just want to know why they broke up. I was able to know this information since my married co-workers asked her and I am just listening while she is revealing this -- this was during valentine's day (1 week before her birthday). This is when I concluded that she is into real men, not gays. But am I wrong?

Girl and her gay friend: They ride the same uber cab, she grabs the gay's arm and puts it on her breast as they walk. They watch movies together, they eat together at fast food chains, they talk about everything. I mean, if no one said that guy is **** I would definitely think they are BF/GF. But it does not add up because the guy is gay, and she is at least 3 levels above him in terms of appearance. The guy is also not rich or anything. Like I mentioned, the gay person is very kind.

Girl's personality: Down to earth, friendly creature with a very kind smile and she has a big heart. She also doesn't do party-party, prefers to stay inside a condo unit when work is done and she lives in a condo with some of her roomies (all female).

Girl and interaction with me: So initially, we don't really begin to talk much. I am very talkative (entp) but it took a while, at least a month, before she starts talking to me comfortably. During this time, there are moments where she wants to know more personal things about me but I heard her asking my married co-workmate to know where I live/stay, instead of directly asking this to me.

There was also a moment when one of my married co-worker said something like ""You know [jenny] asked something about you"".. and jenny was like ""don't tell him, don't hell him"" and her body language got really animated like a little girl. Later on, I found out from my co-worker that she asked ""if I am already married"" --- perhaps, she got that impression because I am very well-dressed and formal at work.

This girl has a very cheerful personality, her eyes light up when she starts to talk to me, she laughs at any simple joke I make. Now, if I compare this to my other workmates even to the other single guy, I believe she laughs even harder when she is with me. The only person where she shows that kind of personality is when she is with the gay guy.

I also noticed that when it's only the two of us in the shift. Or, if we're just the two people alone in the office. She starts to visit me at my cubicle and we can talk for several hours. It feels relaxing to talk to her. During this instance, she asked a lot of things about me. But more than that, she shared something and she was asking almost begging not to tell it to anyone (it's work related). And I say yes, you can trust me. And yes, she told it to me.

When we talk personally, our chairs are like less than a foot away from one another. She likes to cross legs and all her body language are positive directing to me. She also sometimes lick her lips (a few times, could be accidental).

She is like kinda hesitant to touch me. I feel like she wants to, because there's an instance when I was fixing a problem and I made a funny error and she was like going to touch me, but instead went for my chair and starts shaking it.

This girl also sometimes say things to me like ""I heard that woman at the other floor is your crush"". Sometimes, she even say things like ""Hey, that girl on the other cubicle is only 22 years old"" then say ""yiheeee"" with a big grin. Sometimes, she calls me ""dude"" in front of my co-workers.

There was a time our female manager tried to tease me and her, but I frowned and shrug it off. I believe it's one of the reasons why she does not want to touch me. I still do not know. I am perplexed.

When I am at work and in hyperfocus mode and she asked me something and I was like giving her unemotional logical questions why she did this and that, she started to run like a few feet away from me like a little girl then asked our female manager of the same question. I am like whaat?

She is the only person who can detect when I am down eventhough I am good at hiding my feelings. Then she will ask things like ""what's wrong, are you alright?"". Then when I reveal what's causing it, she will make sure that I will feel good later on.

Today's events: Usual work with her gay friend and while we are on our workstation she mentioned words to her friend like ""my parents are at my condo, you should come with me so it will be like ""meet the parents"", ""then let's go to the church after"", she also said ""what lipstick should I wear, maybe I should wear black [giggled a lot]"".

The crazy thing is that, she calls the gay as ""girl"". Like for example, ""you can do it girl"", ""let's go girl!"", ""hey girl"" -- numerous times.

Now, this is driving me really nuts. I mean, you treat this gay guy like your boyfriend/husband already but you call that person a ""girl"". And no, they are not in a relationship at all. That I can guarantee with her previous workmates.

About me

I'm her superior, HB8, 178CM - 160 pounds, 6% body fat. That's already considered a hunk for an asian guy living in an asian country. I am the richest guy on our team, I have a successful business, has high confidence, will not hesitate to do cold approaches to a woman that I find physically attractive.

It's funny because when I was inside a restaurant and I was walking in a suit, ENPJ girl said ""you're handsome"" in a kidding way. She also said it again, a week later when she saw my phone's wallpaper with me doing selfie on a beach -- she said ""wow, you are so handsome"" but this time, it was a shy type statement just before she walks away. But yes, I did hear her say it.

Questions

1) This is driving me crazy. As an ENTP, it's important for me to create a logical structure of a person first before I dive. For this one, a lot of of the puzzle pieces are missing or seem to be incongruent. For example, a girl who is an HB7 staying with an HB4 gay guy who is very kind, dark and fatty but she acts as if they are BF/GF wherein in her previous relationship, that she cannot get over with, her guy is a real man -- not gay. I do not get this. Why?

2) This girl and the gay act as if they are lovers/couples already but she call the gay guy as ""girl"". Why?

3) Do you think this girl and her gay friend are in a romantic/bf/gf type of relationship?

4) Why is she like that? It does not make any sense.

5) Will she be able to accept me, if I tried to date her? It's like I value personality more than anything and I can see we can fit. But I just want to know if she has already decided with the gay guy or not.

twirler,ENFJ Decisions,"My little brother is an ENFJ and oddly enough, and it seems like he works only on inspiration.  He's quite a procrastinator for a J which I find puzzling (so maybe he is more P?).  In any event, he does this thing where he gets so inspired to do something and gets behind an idea completely - furthermore, he's so influential that everyone around him gets behind him and his idea - and then for whatever reason, he simply changes his mind.  It drives us all nuts!

For example, he is trying to figure out what to do after high school.  He sort of tried the college thing and that didn't work out, so now he's thinking he might try to go to another college or move out of the country or something.  Everyone rallies around him and starts to fill out applications for him (because he is completely on-board and asks for our help), but then (often the very next day) he backs off and says, ""Oh, no, nevermind.""   Well, then he misses deadlines and gets upset (has regret)!

It seems to be becoming a sort of boy who cried wolf situation here.  It is hard to believe him when he says he wants to do such and such and will we help him.  At the same time, we WANT to help him, and I know he struggles with stuff like filling out applications and the boring things that I can whip through -- at the same time, I don't really want to whip through 20 applications only for him to change his mind YET AGAIN.

Any suggestions or ideas on what might be going on here?  

My ISTP husband says to make him fill everything out himself.  I get this point - if he wants to do it enough, he will. I mean, in theory.  But, the thing is, my bro does seem to need a lot of help with stuff and gets kind of down on himself when he is unable to do it (i.e. ""I am such a loser - I can't even fill out an application on time."").  And honestly, I think if there were not any work to set it up, and he could just get on a plane or head off to college without all the nonsense paperwork, that he'd go.  He just doesn't want to do the work that will get him there because he's not certain that he wants to go, but then rethinks it and is like... man, I wish I had done it.  AHHH.",https://www.personalitycafe.com//threads/enfj-decisions.1101305/,,,,,,,,,,,
Young,ENFJ behavior,"I think one of my friends is ENFJ, I am just not 100% sure because some of his behavior doesn't fit in the ENFJ stereotype.

First of all he is very charismatic, the most charismatic person I know. He does everything very slowly and is very calm. He is also a great listener, a person who gains your trust very easily. I am pretty sure he has Ni as one of his dominant functions.
That all seems to make him an ENFJ.

But he is really really ignorant. He is a good listener on the one hand but doesn't really feel the need to help anyone who is in need. He just help when someone is really really in need. I know from all ESFJs I know that they care before you even ended the sentence. That's definitely not him. He is also not really sensitive, he knows good what others are feeling but doesn't really ""let it touch"" him, how he calls it. 
He is also very messy and did nothing for the last three years. I think he is 21 now, cancelled school at age 19 and is doing nothing since then.
Does this still fit an ENFJ?

My INFJ friend has a way stronger Fe I think, or at least a Fe which has some other features. He is constantly aware of not hurting anyone while my ENFJ friend seems to be a lot cooler with that. It seems more like he exactly knows how to behave to make you feel good while not seeming overcaring.

Feather Yewfrost,ENFJ - INFJ relationship,"Is this ENFJ really into me?

Hello ENFJs! I would like to know if my relationship with an ENFJ male seem to be developing positively.

First off, I met him like two weeks ago in a party. He was drunk. He wanted to kiss me but I wasn't into kissing strangers at THAT moment (later you'll discover why I say this).
I went away with my friend to dance (this friend is the one who introduced him to me).

The next day I received a message from him. He asked my number to my friend. His first message was ""A beautiful girl owes me a kiss..."", I was like ""Keep dreaming."" and the conversation went on and on...

He proposed me to hang out to the cinema, he was so funny. Then another day we went to the beach and well this day we kissed (first time kissing a ""stranger""). At this point I thought I had screwed it up cause I think he likes challenges and I let him kiss me. So the next day we hanged out I didn't let him, although he stole me one kiss. After that stolen kiss we promised we wouldn't kiss again that day (I don't want to go that quickly, we're just ""friends"" and we're getting to know each other, too soon for so much kiss). Again I fell due to his enchantment, we were playing a board game and he bet a kiss. I lose. However this time I had to be the one giving the kiss. But we bet before that if I kissed him that day we would have a dinner. I wanted that dinner. So I kissed him and I broke my promise. Great... 

What do you think? He is really interested or just playing with me? He's 21 and I'm 19. He said he didn't want to define our relationship as it's soon. But I'm not used to have this affections with friends. I'm confused about his intentions... He likes to give me kisses in the forehead  as he knows I won't hit him for that. But, indeed, those kisses have more effect on me than any other type of kiss, so pure and true.

I saw a conversation he had with my friend and he said I am a good girl (I'm not sure if that is good as others can interpret goodness as ""naive"" o ""dumb"").",https://www.personalitycafe.com//threads/enfj-infj-relationship.1098553/,,,,,,,,,,,

Happy about Nothing.,"ENFJ women, fighting gender stereotypes","I've come to the conclusion as of late that my type isn't generally accepted and understood in large part because of the fact that I am a female. ENFJ males are very rare, and therefore their strength and sensitive disposition gives them an edge up in leadership roles.

However, I feel as though, partially because I'm a woman, my opinionated nature, leadership abilities, and even general intelligence are overlooked. 

As an ENFJ, I have developed clear and succinct opinions on many issues that I feel are overlooked because of my gender. I'm not sure if it's because many men (and women!) hold onto old-fashioned ideas about gender-placing a male in a more dominant role. It definitely seems more comfortable and accepted to many people.

I remember a thread way back when where some individuals were talking about what types would work best with ENFJs. Someone suggested that every NF type worked well with an ENFJ male, but not an ENFJ female. 

In fact, that person suggested that INFJ may be the only ""plausible"" option for me.

I understand where this is coming from, but that doesn't mean I'm perfectly okay with it.

ENFJ ladies, have you ever struggled with your femininity as a strong, leading personality type? How does the world interact with you/ how has it affected your relationships?

I'm interested in the opinion of other ENFJ females, but anyone of any type (male or female) is encouraged to post.

JustTima,ENFJs Traditionalists?,"Hello beautiful creatures,
My story begins upon meeting an ESFJ a little while ago, we became good friends, albeit with little to no chemistry. However, I did notice him paying close attention to what is considered ""normal"" by our general society, and noticing how people would view his actions. That definitely didn't sit right with me, as a rebel to all that is normal, but I played it off my mind like a champ. Not until he commented on my recetly-acquired highlights with ""what would people think?""
My question is this:
""Do ENFJs let other people influence their actions?/Do they base their actions on what is socially acceptable by many?""

AuntieEm,ENFJ waterworks - how easily do you cry?,"My ENFJ dad cries openly and easily from joy, or in empathy with others who are deeply moved. He cries readily but quietly in grief. In all those circumstances, he's quite at peace with crying - totally unembarrassed. However, I would say that he cries neither often nor very gracefully in confrontations. 

My ENFJ childhood best-friend cries very easily over pretty much everything, and she haaaates it. 

I cry easily enough at movies, shows, commercials - but it makes me maaaaad, because I think that's dumb, so I try to hide it and really rather don't want it mentioned: if you do point it out, I will biff you with a cushion. I'm pretty steely in confrontations - I hate crying because it makes me inarticulate, and distracts from the issue at hand. I've never cried from joy, per se, but I have done so as a reaction to beauty, which is similar. I'm never particularly comfortable with doing it, though, and kinda feel like I ought to be?
