"I wanna see how this goes, since I know our minds are sporadic as ever and although many of you will try to refine your posts, i urge you NOT to go over and over with extensive amounts of editing. Just post the little, random, complex, enlightening thought that you currently are holding in your head.

Mine; As 2011 approaches I have realized that I am experiencing the onset of another decade of human life passing me by. I have made it 17 years on this planet, gone through so many different friendships and scenarios of drama that have shaped me into quite the interesting person I am today. I have experienced heart-break, death, depression, enlightenment, revelation, and a change in spiritual belief. My constant search for inner and outer knowledge has not changed yet the path to obtain this has wavered and been manipulated in a multitude of ways through my life. I am wondering if my interest in a career in astronomy will stay true as college approaches or will my newfound love for chemistry take over? Or will one of the random inspirational hobbies that pop-up in my life become my future path?"
"I thought that we could use a thread like this. I know there is a ""confessions"" thread, but that's not quite the same, and we haven't had a proper ""INTP Madness"" thread (which is my reading of ""stream of consciousness"") since the crush thread and it's ill-begotten clones were banished to the Land of Winds and Ghosts (also known as Spam World).

So (copying from the original):

Take issue with something going on in society?

Having a bad day?

Have something on your mind that wont go away?

Experience something so fabulous you just have to express it?

Accidentally sold your mother to a pimp in a back alley game of poker?

Have an idea, or discover something so amazing you must tell everyone?

Post your vent (or experience, idea, etc.) here!

This thread is not for venting about other members, the moderators, or the forum.
Don't over-spam the thread (I can't expect INTPs not to spam a least a little) lest it be sent screaming into the spam-abyss."

"Thread exists in the ESTJ & INTJ sections and seems to have been a rather useful addition, kudos to @TheWaffle  . 

Any type can ask a question, and they will be answered by the INTPs .

Any kind of questions.


Shoot!"
"Now, before you start, I know there's no real 'solution' to depression, but I was not going to define that in what little space I have in the title.

I can see already that many of you have depression just from skimming the forum. I don't frequent this corner much so instead of simply sharing stories I was hoping that you could offer me coping mechanisms, in particular maybe coping mechanisms that work for your type in particular.

Have any of you managed to pull out of depression? How?

Have any of you have to cope with suicidal thoughts... what do you do to fight this?"
"I got the idea from another thread and it looked like a lot of people liked it, so I thought I would bring one over here.

"I saw one of these for ISTPs, and one for INTJs. So I thought I'd search to see if I could find one for INTPs. And here it is!










Here are my results for this bingo card:










My first bingo! How about you?"
"I'm a 21 year old college male in the U.S. who has been trying to do everything over the past four years to correct for my INTP shortcomings. I came into college highly introverted and socially inept and have been doing all the classic INTP self-help tips to be more social and driven. In many ways, I've embraced my ENTJ shadow, which seems to be a lot more valued in society.

I joined a fraternity to improve my social skills, learn social mannerisms (my parents never really bothered to teach me American manners), and make friends, whipped my body into amazing shape, improved my dress sense and taste, and having an amazing job lined up post-graduation. My motivation was not to social climb or improve my career prospects, but to find genuine happiness through meaningful connections to other people. However, despite having overcome the main INTP shortfalls (not leaving your room, avoiding human contact, being inconsistent, etc), I still can't find any lasting happiness. My parents were immigrants and they couldn't teach me anything about navigating American society, so I had to painfully learn it all on my own.

From the outside, I appear successful and on the right track, but I'm despairing at this point since despite doing everything I was told to do to correct my shortcomings, I'm still miserable. Not even volunteering for community projects nor my normal hobbies has made me happy. Most of my friendships feel fleeting and insubstantial, although I have a handful of close genuine friendships, and despite having hooked up in college, I can't find a girl to form a lasting relationship with. If I try to be genuine, my INTP traits (being curious about things they don't deem important, etc) turn them off, and if I try to act like a typical college dude, I can't keep the act up for long. I hate the advice ""Just be yourself"" so much because no one really wants you to be yourself as an INTP male it seems - guess that's just for ESTJ/ENTJ/ESTP males. It's not like I'm just chasing sorority girls either - I'm either too fratty for the nerdier girls or too nerdy for partier crowd.


I've been on this forum many times for advice on various issues I've mentioned here and I'm grateful for the responses, but I can't seem to be happy no matter how many band-aids I apply. My current social circle is a mix of my fraternity friends and my nerdier friends so I don't think changing my social circles will be fix everything. I'm in need of radical life advice because I can't do this for much longer. I can't wait to graduate and work at a job where my Ti-Ne is actually valued instead of dismissed. Any help is appreciated."
"INTP 5w4 sp/so

Avoidant Anxious Depressed

I recently began a new relationship in the past few months, and I'm uncertain whether it was the right decision. Before this, I believed I wasn't ready to embark on a new relationship after the end of my previous one. I have deep-seated trust issues, particularly in the context of intimate relationships. While I was able to manage these issues in my last relationship, I can't help but wonder if it left a lasting, perhaps subconscious, impact on me, despite initially feeling okay about it.

My previous relationship came to an end due to a multitude of factors, and one significant issue was the emotional instability of my partner (an INFP). This instability often manifested in ways that made me feel physically unsafe at times. Additionally, I was affected by their negative emotions towards others. Whenever I brought up the topic of needing more space, suggesting they stay at their place when they were busy with their stuff, or proposing that we stop seeing each other every day for a while, they would get really upset. When I mentioned possibly pausing the relationship for a bit, they would try to apologize and either slap themselves or kneel down as a way to show their apology (though I probably wasn't even trying to blame them for anything). When I locked them out, they would knock on the front door continuously, even if there were people outside, and call my name while spamming my phone with calls. I felt like they were projecting onto me and not recognizing me as an individual, but rather as some kind of comforting toy that babies need. I kind of just went with the flow after that because I was scared it might get physical. After the breakup, I was somewhat taken aback by my emotional response. Unlike what I expected, I didn't find myself engulfed in the usual feelings of sadness or heartbreak that often accompany the end of a significant relationship. Instead, there was a sense of relief and even a newfound sense of freedom.

I have consistently grappled with the task of identifying and comprehending my emotions, a challenge that often complicates conflict management, as I tend to shy away from confrontations. For as long as I can recall, my life has operated in survival mode. Trusting or relying on anyone, including my own family, has proven to be a daunting endeavor. I'm not particularly in need of company, but I do recognize the importance of having some form of support and individuals to turn to when assistance is required. While I primarily lean on my friends for such support, I must admit that I don't feel exceptionally close to them. My perspective on relationships has undergone significant changes, particularly following the conclusion of my first romantic relationship, as mentioned in the preceding paragraph. My attachment style began shifting even before I entered that initial relationship, and it has now veered more towards the extreme avoidance end of the spectrum. I was once able to place trust in my former partner, but it has grown increasingly challenging. I perceive romantic feelings as finite resources, ones that, once depleted, are exceedingly difficult, if not impossible, to replenish.

Now I've been grappling with a fear that my significant other may not view me as a human being, but rather as some kind of object they can use to satisfy their desires, which can extend to abstract desires such as exploiting my insecurities or manipulating me or trying to shape me to better match their ideals.

The significant other I'm currently with is either an INFJ or ISFJ (I'm still uncertain), as he mentioned that he received the result of INFJ after taking the 16 personalities test. However, I believe he is more closely aligned with ISFJ for the following reasons:

1. When he isn't feeling emotionally well, he tends to revert to his routine, simply lying in bed and doing nothing.

2. Prior to our relationship, his life maintained a consistent routine, which I find ""boring"" rather than ""stable."" For example, he eats the same breakfast every day.

On the other hand, he struggles to express himself in a linear manner. He often conveys his thoughts by repeating the same idea in various ways and using numerous filler words. My guess is that this is not due to a lack of ability but rather because he feels uncomfortable. Sometimes, when I ask him a question that should elicit a simple ""yes or no"" response, he tends to elaborate to the point where I must redirect his thoughts and encourage him to provide a straightforward answer ( yes or no ) - I don't need all that extra elaboration I just need a decision.

He has had some challenging relationships from my perspective, and I'm uncertain about the prospects of our relationship. The partners I've had in this relationship and the previous one tend to be more on the clingy side. It makes me wonder if there's something about me that attracts this type, although I'm not entirely sure. Maybe it's the anxious-avoidant waltz. In my opinion, when a relationship encounters problems, both parties share some level of responsibility, even if it isn't necessarily a 50-50 split. I attempted to distance myself from him several times in the past few months, but it hasn't been successful. He would physically come to my apartment and wait for me to come out. Eventually, I gave up and started to view it as fate, accepting it as an experience I must go through in life. At that time, we were not in a romantic relationship; we were just friends. His actions made me feel extremely anxious because I sensed that he was crossing boundaries and suffocating me. Additionally, we had differing perceptions of our relationship back then, he was more possessive than he should be. Because the the boundary and personal space issue, we've gone through many arguments in the past. Now that we're in a romantic relationship because I gave in and I'm tired of having to face these arguments and think I might as well as just start to hold a more ""serious: view on this relationship, (by changing it into a romantic relationship), thing will become better. As of now, things are more balanced and improved. I didn't make this decision only because I want to avoid arguments, but also because I replicate feelings towards him (though I might not have chosen this if things weren't how they were).

Certainly, it's important to acknowledge the positive aspects of the relationship as well. I appreciate that he has taken on a significant role in helping me with essential tasks that have contributed to my well-being, such as ensuring I eat and helping with chores. His support in these aspects has been meaningful and valuable to me. We've also developed many inside jokes and share similar humor. We still have communication issues and occasionally run into misunderstandings, but despite the challenges we've faced, there are certainly good moments too. However, I must admit that our relationship has exhibited signs of toxicity. He has expressed a desire to address these issues by considering the possibility of visiting a relationship therapist to work through our issues. We may explore this option when both of us have the time available to do so.

I may consistently place my own needs as a top priority and often experience insecurity when it comes to being in relationships. While this individual has openly expressed their care for me and has gone to great lengths to show it, I still find that it doesn't completely alleviate my feelings of insecurity (they are insecure, too). I still don't understand the meaning of romantic relationships; however, I find contentment in my own company and with my friends. I don't feel the need for marriage or dating, as I genuinely enjoy my solitude. I believe I prefer not to carry the weight of emotional responsibilities, as I tend to take them quite seriously. 

Maybe romantic relationships won't ever work for me. 

Maybe romantic relationships aren't for me."
"No, not that HAL. 

Not this guy.










But instead, how about:

""HAL (the red A.I. light from the Space Odyssey film), positioned like a god in the sky overlooking a vast urban expanse, drawn with a dark mood, in the style of a 1950s moon landing photo""










Hm, not quite a 'moon landing photo', but a good effort. Thanks, A.I.

Welcome to my new little hobby.

This is done using the image creation tool from Bing A.I. (link here - you might need to register to use it)

Let's try some more:


""a wide open cityscape in the style of a steampunk drawing with great attention to detail, and a little bit of greenery too""











""humanoids, in the artistic style of H. R. Giger""











""draw a 1950s style American product advertisement, but it is a dog promoting the item""











""draw a typical British wartime propaganda poster about drinking tea, but it should be a dog drinking the tea""











""please draw a jungle scene with a team of angry monkeys on the left side, and robotic elephant on the right. The monkeys are facing the elephant and are scared of it. The drawing should be in the style of 1980s pop art.""

(result not as requested but still excellent)










I will add more to this occasionally. Feel free to contribute.

RULE: Include the prompt that was used to generate the image(s).

I have kept this in the INTP subforum because I hoped to see things ""made by INTP brains"", but anyone is free to contribute. Mods, shift it to the art subforum if you feel it necessary."
"INTPs, I'm interested in your personal experiences here.  If this might be unhelpful to you then please pass it by 

This question pops into my mind sometimes, and lately I've had too much time to think (never a good thing).  So please help me out.  I realize that any type can go through these things/ events, and I don't think the ""trauma"" part, especially, would create an ""INTP"", however I wonder if there is any link between an INTP and these possible past events/ current situations.  Also take this as a complete question, as I realize that these issues may have been addressed separately (but not together that I am aware) elsewhere on the forum.

1.  Have you ever thought you might have high-functioning autism? Been tested? Researched it?  Or do you know nothing about it or simply haven't had any interest in it?

2. This could be a sensitive one, so don't answer if you're not comfortable, and I don't need details sorry and thanks.  In your past have you suffered some form of abuse (emotional/ physical) which you feel has impacted the way you function in your current relationships (if you have any, let's face it we're introverts and sometimes get caught up in our work)?

3.  Have you been through trauma which you feel has changed your personality?

4.  If you can't relate to any of the above points, now is your time to say so.

Feel free to tell me off for this post, but only if you're an INTP (cause I literally can't handle criticism in any form from other types at the moment - i.e. actual logical responses and not self-defined logical responses are welcome here)."

"I seem to be very good at it. I make very sensible bets and so far have lost £80, but won over 500.

I usually bet in play, during games, and spot little flaws in the thinking of the admins of the site.

I've been around a lot of gamblers who seem to think I'm just lucky, but they throw away hundreds and silly bets and are tempted by the potential winnings."
"Do you think INTPs would be less or more likely to smoke?
If you do smoke, could you explain why?
 If you don't smoke, how do you feel or think about smokers and smoking?
Anyone, how do you feel about tobacco tax increases without an increase in alcohol tax?"
"Morning all.

I've posted similarly in the past, and though I understand the INTPs in my life a great deal more than most of the people around them, I never assume to understand you guys completely when it comes to extreme displays of emotion.

What does your utmost fury look like, on the rare occasion it actually rears it head? And given the option to vent your anger in any which way you could possibly imagine, what would you do? I'm researching for a piece of writing, and I'd really like to get this right. Something I'm looking portray in my writing is how introverts behave when in their own private space - it'd be good for the wider world to get a bit more familiar with this - and today's line of enquiry is INTP's when they're pissed off to a biblical degree.

Looking forward to hearing how mental you can get!"
"So far, no one has been able to explain Fi to me in a comprehensible way. I realize this may not be the best place to inquire since it's our Devil function but all the more reason to attempt to understand it, right? I understand Fe to be holistic and harmony based. Fi had been described as self-concerned. Would it be fair to say Fi is more of a subjective function whereas Fe is more of an objective one? Insight from other types are welcome too of course and especially from Fi users (I'm talkin' to you ENTJs, INTJs, INFPs and ENFPs!) Please provide examples or hypotheticals."
"I have been thinking about INTPs in fiction and it occurred to me that most INTPs in fictional works are either good or neutral. I can't think of any villain or anti-hero who is an obvious INTP, with the exception of maybe the Joker (from the Batman comics) although he seems too extroverted to be an INTP. It's as though the INTP isn't seen as a good intellectual villain by the audiences/readers of fictional work, there are more than enough INTJ villains though: Hannibal Lecter, Lex Luthor, Count Dracula, Light Yagami, Emperor Palpatine etc. The INTJs are sometimes even jokingly characterized as 'evil masterminds'. But what about the INTPs? We could make for great villains, the type of evil mastermind that would fool the entire world, and an INTP anti-hero would be even cooler I think.

So, what are some fictional villains/anti-heroes that could be typed as INTPs? What kind of villain/anti-hero do you think an INTP would be? What are the characteristics of an evil fictional INTP?

*Don't know whether this has been a thread before, but if it already existed then I couldn't find it so I decided to make this into a new thread."
What does it look like for you?
"Hello!

I'm on a bit of a quest to figure out if there are any other Highly Sensitive INTP's on here.  I currently have my profile as INTP, although my T is only slightly higher than my F.  

A year ago I read The Highly Sensitive Person, and it made a vast difference in my life.  I am very tuned into my environment and very sensitive to smells, sights, pain, etc.  I am a ""high sensation seeker,"" however, so I do at times seek out opportunities to 'stimulate' myself - be it through listening to powerful music, riding roller coasters, running into a freezing lake at night, watching thrillers, etc.  (Just so long as I can retreat to a peaceful land afterwards.)

I always thought myself to be very ""feely,"" simply in the sense that I am very aware of how people feel, and it is important to me to interact with someone in a way that they will understand.  I do make an effort not to offend people, and harmony is important to me as I do not like emotional disruption.

However, I have always felt incredibly frustrated with how different I am from other women (and people in general).  Clarification: this is not in the sense of ""I wish I was like everyone else."" Rather, ""I hate that I cannot articulate these thoughts to people and have them understand or be able to converse with me.""  I have always despised how mushy and shallow and emotional people tend to generally be.  It never seems like I feel emotional at times when it seems like most people are, and the only way I know how to comfort someone who is upset is by logically walking through the situation and seeking a solution.  I have learned how to comfort people with physical touch or empathetic words, simply because I can read people, but it always is an awkward experience for me.

When I personally experience emotion, it is chaotic and completely drains the life out of me.  I probably get upset once or twice a month (or week, depending on my hormones, ha), and when I do I'm in a horrid depression.  It's during these ""depressions"" that I seem more ""feely"" than humanly possible, and I grow even more upset because I know my feelings are utterly illogical and I can see what I *should* rationally do or feel, but cannot do anything about it until my emotional wave passes.

I am fascinated by art, science, nature, animals, patterns, codes, puzzles, and systems.  I want to love people, because I admire people who have a heart for broken people, but I'm a little overwhelmed by human beings.  I prefer reading things that intelligent or insightful people have written, or talking with someone about what they think about certain things.  I have an easy time talking with kids (I talk to them like they are another adult, not like they are plushy babies), and playing with them, but I do not enjoy being around children or babies when they are upset or fussy or are causing trouble.  It seems there is no rubric for dealing with them and that scares me!  (the same often applies to adults...haha.)

Anyhow, that's probably enough for now.  I guess I am just seeking to find out if there are other INTP's out there who are highly sensitive and/or have a thing for the more creative/artistic sides of the world.  (Not that we don't all love the things that INTPs love, but you know what I mean.)

I look forward to reading some responses!  And hey, even if you're not at all sensitive, I would love to hear what you think.  (Maybe I'm simply an INFP with a lot of emotional problems? erc2

-barefoot mango"
"I do. 

It's not that I don't like women, I just don't fit in with the majority of them. I can't relate, and I find myself having to fake it a bit so that I don't stick out like a sore thumb. I get bored and zone out of conversations. I end up hanging out with guys instead. I'm much more at ease around men. 

Obviously I'm making huge generalisations here, and there are of course exceptions to the rule. Some of my closest friends are women (mostly INTJs and ISTJs).

What about the rest of you girls? Do you have this problem too?"
"I hadn't found any threads on this specific issue and personality clashing, but I thought it important to discuss in case any other INTP's had similar experiences in regards to an emotionally exploitative ENFJ mother/father?

My mother is an ENFJ, and I really do love her. She's funny, thoughtful, always tells me she loves me and hugs me a lot. I have some really fantastic memories with my mum, sometimes we might go through periods where we genuinely delight in each others company, but in saying that, there's a lot behind the scenes crap that she dismisses even happened.

It's the personal unnecessary attacks, CONSTANT guilt trips/passive aggression, always calling me a disappointing shit and a hassle, basically a human hovercraft always wanting to know what I'm up to because quiet = suspicious, never interested in my opinions/interests, made fun of my weight in high school and put me on diets, compares me to other girls, slamming doors in my face, leaving me locked outside when I arrived home 10 minutes past curfew, never let me go to sleepovers or have birthday parties, etc etc. I really was just this slightly overweight, nerd who didn't want any trouble.

Another thing that amazes me is that both of my siblings are both feelers, and aren't nearly as distressed by her? If I'm ever a dick to someone, I usually don't even realize I'm being a dick. I'm probably just being honest haha. But a feeler will be a fucking dick shit to people just because they can and they know better. Inbetween kicking a few cats.

Generally I'm not so sensitive, as usually peoples comments are just water off a ducks back for me. But this is just on a whole different plane. I literally cringe every time I do the absolute slightest thing wrong because I know there's this impending dark cloud waiting to emotionally take a dump on me. She screams anytime I even eat something that I didn't know was hers.

Haha can you tell I'm not bitter? Ah well. If any other INTP's relate or if any other types can offer any additional insights, that'd be cool too. Free therapy, God bless the internet."
I've noticed I miss hear what people say often. I'm not deaf or anything lol. I don't know maybe its because I'm not always fully listening I could be thinking about something. Or I just think someone said something which they didn't. Then I only half hear what they say.  It could just be me on this  one.
"From all the stereotypes, this is what bugs me the most - that INTPs hate celebrating their birthdays and they never tell when their birthday is. I am not talking on behalf of all INTP right now, but on behalf of myself now.
I am already 33 y.o. and birthday celebration... I can't remember when was the last one. And no, it's not because I don't want to, but rather because no one even remembers about birthday anymore. Yes, family included. And I get angry when on 24th October (my birthday, feel free to wish me a Happy Birthday on that day) nobody comes, nobody even calls. When I was a kid, my birthday parties were thrown every year and they were fun! Now, there are only memories. Sad.
That's my story anyway. Do you have any stories of your own? Feel free to share."
"After searching a lot for my type I finally can rest comfortably, knowing I'm an INTP. I had various doubts and was very skeptical but I managed to slowly understand why I'm INTP and why some parts of the description didn't match.

After this, I have one last challenge for myself: being able to describe my own personality. Let's do it.

First of all, let's clarify something first:

MBTI can't describe a person's behavior, tastes, dreams or interests entirely with perfect accuracy. Two persons of the same type can be completely different. But there are always some common behaviors that some types of people can share, which can be described and analyzed by their cognitive processes. It does not mean that a person of type x will act the same way in every situation y. This means there can be some exceptions for everything that I may write here.

INTPs are defined by their 4 principal functions - Ti, Ne, Si, and Fe. Let's see a summary of each one:

Ti stands for Introverted Thinking, but I prefer to call it subjective reasoning. I like to call it that way because basically it is exactly what Ti does. Ti is a judging function which means it will judge every information that INTPs may collect. As their first function, it means that it works in hardcore style, so an INTP will only really absorb data that is accepted by Ti. Ti is logical but it does not mean you are a supercomputer like some descriptions may make you feel like. It just means that you like to pick information, deconstruct it, analyze each part of it and(if needed) deduce the bigger picture of it. Or a solution to a problem. Ti also likes categorizing things. And all this comes so naturally for INTPs that they don't even realize they are doing it. Also because it's subjective, people won't see you doing it.

Ne is Extraverted Intuition. I didn't have a special name for it, but with some help, I do now: objective possibilities. Ne is the primary way the world sees you, this is usually what is being shown to people(because it's extraverted). Ne is the primary way that you gather information. Ne is like that kid with hyperactivity who just can't sit and stay quiet for 5 minutes... But just inside their mind because people may sometimes question if INTPs are really alive. It just wants to explore the world and everything. But unlike Se, it wants to explore ideas and concepts in an abstract way, rather than using the 5 senses. In the INTP's case, it means that Ne serves Ti feeding it with new information to judge. For the INTP it's normal to be able to connect various ideas easily and think outside the box, being able to see outside the box and predict outcomes to his and other's actions and learning by others' experiences.

Si means Introverted Sensing. Think in a hard drive, that is how Si works most for INTP: an HD. Every data collected by Ne and judged by Ti will be stored with Si. Because Ne is focused on ideas it may be kinda negligent with the physical world. Si help to remember the mistakes from the past so INTPs can act right when they encounter the same problem in the next opportunity. Not only that, it helps you to interpret the data you experienced with your body and store it... But it won't be super detailed because it's underdeveloped. Also, INTPs are prone to neglecting physical necessities like eating or sleeping.

Fe is the last one, Extraverted feeling. Which I would call objective ethics. Fe is focused on aiding people, is the part of INTPs that prevent them to be robots. But because it's the last one, it's even more underdeveloped, which means they want to help people but don't have any idea on how to give emotional support. If you talk with some INTP about your problem, they will probably give a logical solution to it.

Okay, let's now talk about how this works in real life.

Socializing

INTPs tend to live in their own heads. It's common for them to be completely oblivious to their surrounds. My point here is that they are so used in being absorbed in their thoughts that socializing isn't always a priority. But this does not mean that INTPs don't like people or hanging out sometimes. When they are socializing, people, as I said, will usually perceive their auxiliary Ne. This means they will be that quiet person observing everyone talk, with calm curiosity. Will make some well-timed jokes and then get back observing. Then they will be completely distracted by some random thought triggered by a topic that will lead to another and another and another topic inside their head. After several minutes they will try to catch up on the actual topic or discuss what they were thinking, only to get his friends confused about how he could get so far away from the first conversation. But behind that is his Ti, holding him back and analyzing everything, every time. That's why Ne won't be so intense as it would be in a Ne-dom, they will be much more concerned in being accurate in everything they do or talk than being creative and active.

While that happens Si will help the INTP to remember what not to do or talk, based on past experiences, will also help them remember about that interesting article they read in Wikipedia that no one cares about. And Fe will be helping them care or try to care for others, some INTPs may be that kind of person that laughs about a joke that someone made and no one in the group was hearing because they were so focused on talking at the same time. An INTP with minimal Fe can be that type of person who wants to be kind and nice to everyone, not knowing how to show boundaries to others or being rude when trying to.

INTP's biggest weakness is its lack of emotional intelligence. Just like anyone INTPs experience deep and intense emotions but don't know how o deal with it. They usually ignore, suppress or try to analyze it with Ti. This leads to being bad at coping with stressful situations, so bad that they don't even realize sometimes that they are stressed until it's too late. When INTPs reach their limits they can become overly emotional and express an exaggerated response to conflict. Or isolate themselves into their mind, which can lead to being over-analytical and repetitive, thinking about the same problems in an endless loop.

Decision-making

Their approach to making a decision is basically problem-solving. But Ti is a very exigent function and won't just accept any solution. It needs to be above all accurate, not just efficient or ethical. So INTPs can take a lot of time to actually make a decision, depending on the complexity of the problem. Their main approach is to gather some time alone to think. They will try to use Ti and Si to solve, considering Fe when needed(but not much). If this is not sufficient they may ask for help, but not to solve the problem, they won't easily accept other's solutions because INTPs only accept their own reasoning(unless the solution makes sense for them) they will usually ask somebody for more information or try to explain their thought process to get an opinion, which is Ne in action. People may think that they want external validation, sometimes it's true, but usually, they are just testing their ideas and thoughts. Probably anything that the person try to say, the INTP will already know. But it's useful for the INTP to do that so they can test the possibilities before deciding something. Their decision process is so careful that after taking a decision, they become very stubborn and won't accept counter-arguments easily. Because they probably tested all those counters before alone.

But if needed to make a fast decision in a problem they never dealt with, they won't know how to act properly, which can appear as they are some kind of dumb weirdos and making INTPs stressed and sometimes disappointed with themselves. Probably a well developed Ne can help INTPs to deal with this kind of situation.

Romance

INTPs can be kinda hard to deal with in a relationship, depending on which type the partner is. Because they will usually require time alone to think and focus on doing their stuff. Also, INTPs can be disorganized as hell. They are usually oblivious to how messy they are and even when they notice, INTPs don't really care. But because they care for their partner and try to always understand others, they may usually work on this. They value creative and intellectual partners and will probably be exigent in that aspect. They are also very laid back and value freedom from both sides.

Career

I've only seen two types of INTPs until now: the ones who take a career very seriously and the ones who don't give a f*ck. INTPs will often prefer careers that avoid the need to make a physical effort. The stereotype says that they tend to prefer science and technology, but they can be anything that catches their interest(just like any type). The problem is that they get bored easily when they feel there is a lack of challenge in their field. There is also INTPs who prefer to work on jobs that don't need much effort and time investment, so they can focus on their personal pursuits in their free time.





That's it guys, hope you liked. I tried to make a more human, realistic type of description, instead of the super genius with no emotions stereotype. I took into consideration my own experiences and others I've seen on the internet. I'm an INTP 5w4, so I'm not sure if it will work with other enneagrams."

"Post your bad jokes here. Jokes that you've heard that were bad, or jokes that you've told that were just bad. (It's up to you what ""bad"" means!)

I am working on a lengthy one now (a long story joke) but here's a smaller one 'til I get done with that one.


 





A couple is driving down a highway in Texas. (For those not in US/aware, it is the largest state in the US, sans Alaska.) Their car runs out of gas, but they see a large building ahead--who knows? It could be a gas station. They decide to take the trek together.

Unfortunately, the walk was much longer than they expected. Seconds turned to minutes, minutes turned to hours, and well... you get the gist. Finally, after several hours, they arrived. The structure was so large, it looked like a small (but close) building from so far away! A large sign hung from the massive doors on the front: ""Gym's Steaks."" What kind of name is that? The couple thought.

Pushing through the massive door, they are greeted and finally directed to a table. The table was big enough to hold at least eight people, and it was clearly the smallest table around. Ironically, there were very few people in sight. ""Drinks?"" The waiter asked. After giving them an order--a simple coke and water, the waiter left, leaving two very large menus. The man turned to his wife, and said ""I guess what they say is true, everything is bigger in Texas. They chuckled, and looked at the menu.

After a few minutes the waiter returned--with massive drinks in hand. He set down the two gigantic jugs, and asked, sowly, ""arrre y'all ready fer yer ordah?""

Smiling to themselves, they each ordered a steak and sides--the only thing really available here--and the waiter moved on. Looking around, they began to comment--an incredibly large rocking chair was on a center stage. The chair was at least the height of two tall men, and the width of one as well. A small ladder was propped up beside it, as if people actually used the rocking chair. Magnificent trinkets adorned the wall--yokes for oxen at least twice the normal size, black and white pictures of dogs and horses twice the size of humans (obviously Photoshopped), and a few tools at least thrice their normal size.

After talking a while on the subject and absolute absurdness of the environment, their steaks finally arrived. The waiter, holding a massive tray, lowered it for the couple to see. There, sitting on the massive tray, were four massive plates: two huge steaks, and two heaping piles of various sides. They were so surprised, neither said a word--was this customary? They thought as they stared. The waiter placed the plates on the table and left.

A few speechless moments past, until the woman finally said ""I guess it is true."" They both began to laugh quietly. After a while, the steaks began to disappear. The waiter stopped by several times, and finally both had consumed quite a lot--and quite a bit of their drinks! ""Where are the restrooms?"" The man said, standing and holding his stomach. The waiter told him, and off he went.

Following a very long hallway, the man was amused by all of the pictures and other devices along the walls. He passed several doors, each very large but without signs. ""Did he say the second to last on the right?"" He took a guess, and opened that door. It was completely dark, but he remembered the man saying something about the light being off. Tile floors, so must be it. He stumbled in, trying to find the light switch, but it was so dark. Finally, he slipped and fell into a large swimming pool.

 





Panicking, he shouted ""don't flush! Don't flush! Oh my god, please don't flush!"" as he climbed out of the pool. (Later he realized why it was called ""Gym's Steaks."")







So ya, that's a bad one for ya. I am terrible at telling story-like jokes IRL, so post your bad ones (and experiences) here!"
"Flirty INTP's out there. I once made a thread am I a flirt. And my recent interaction made me ask myself.
How do INTP's flirt?"
"For the first time ever, scientists at the University of Rochester have found one of the reasons our brain needs sleep to survive. Turns out, when we sleep, our brain takes that time to clean out the build-up of brain junk we accumulate during our waking hours. Sleep is pretty much necessary for our body’s mental street-cleaners to come out and do their work.

When cells do their daily cell-type work, they produce waste product. The rest of the body has this waste cleared out by the lymphatic system, but the brain is disconnected from that, so it needs another way to wipe out the waste. The brain has it’s own garbage men, carried on the waves of cerebrospinal fluid, who surf the leftovers straight down to your liver for elimination. As it turns out, the brain’s garbage men move twice as fast when you’re sleeping, because your neurons shrink by half, making the fluid channels wider.

“This study shows that the brain has different functional states when asleep and when awake,” said U of R researcher Maiken Nedergaard. “In fact, the restorative nature of sleep appears to be the result of the active clearance of the by-products of neural activity that accumulate during wakefulness.”"
"Represent a young INTP or a Ti-Si loop. I like the last verse of the song, has that self depreciating that INTP's are known for at times.

Also this isn't a jab at you all either. I posted a song that kinda represents a Ni-Ti loop or a INFJ. 
Maybe I will find a song that will go with all loops or types.



Sometimes I try to do things and it just doesn't work out the way I wanted too
And I get real frustrated, and its like
And I try hard to do it and take my time
And it just doesn't work out the way I want it too
It's like I concentrate on it real hard but it just doesn't work out
And everything I do and everything I try, it never turns out
It's like I need time to figure these things out
But there's always someone there going
Hey Mike: You know we've been noticing you've been having a lot of problems lately
You know, maybe you get away, and like maybe you should talk about it,
You'll feel a lot better
And I go: No it's okay, you know I'll figure it out
Just leave me alone I'll figure it out
You know I'll just work it on myself,
And they go: Well you know if you want to talk about it I'll be here, you know
And you'll probably feel a lot better if you talk about it, so want don't you talk about it
And I go: No I don't want to, I'm okay, I'll figure it out myself
And they just keep bugging me and they just keep bugging me
And it builds up inside
So you're gonna be institutionalized
You'll come out brainwashed with bloodshot eyes
You won't have any say
They'll brainwash you until you see their way
I'm not crazy - institution
You're the one who's crazy - institution
You're driving me crazy - institution
They stuck me in an institution
Said it was the only solution
To give me the needed professional help
To protect me from the enemy - myself
I was in my room and I was just like staring at the wall thinking about everything
But then again I was thinking about nothing
And then my mom came in and I didn't even know she was there she called my name
And I didn't even hear it, and then she started screaming: MIKE! MIKE!
And I go: What, what's the matter?
And she goes: What's the matter with you?
I go: There's nothing wrong mom
And she goes: Don't tell me that, you're on drugs!
And I go: No mom I'm not on drugs I'm okay, I was just thinking you know,
Why don't you get me a Pepsi
And she goes: No you're on drugs!
I go: Mom I'm okay, I'm just thinking
She goes: No you're not thinking, you're on drugs! Normal people don't act that way!
I go: Mom just give me a Pepsi, please
All I want is a Pepsi, and she wouldn't give it to me
All I wanted was a Pepsi, just one Pepsi, and she wouldn't give it to me
Just a Pepsi
They give you a white shirt with long sleeves
Tied around you're back, you're treated like thieves
Drug you up because they're lazy
It's too much work to help a crazy
I'm not crazy - institution
You're the one who's crazy - institution
You're driving me crazy - institution
They stuck me in an institution
Said it was the only solution
To give me the needed professional help
To protect me from the enemy - myself
I was sitting in my room and my mom and my dad came in
And they pulled up a chair and they sat down, they go:
Mike, we need to talk to you
And I go: Okay what's the matter
They go:
Me and your mom have been noticing lately that you've been having a lot of problems,
You've been going off for no reason and we're afraid you're gonna hurt somebody,
We're afraid you're gonna hurt yourself
So we decided that it would be in your interest if we put you somewhere
Where you could get the help that you need
And I go: Wait, what are you talking about, we decided!?
My best interest?! How do you know what's my best interest is?
How can you say what my best interest is? What are you trying to say, I'm crazy?
When I went to your schools, I went to your churches,
I went to your institutional learning facilities?! So how can you say I'm crazy?
They say they're gonna fix my brain
Alleviate my suffering and my pain
But by the time they fix my head
Mentally I'll be dead
I'm not crazy - institution
You're the one who's crazy - institution
You're driving me crazy - institution
They stuck me in an institution
Said it was the only solution
To give me the needed professional help
To protect me from the enemy - myself
It doesn't matter, I'll probably get hit by a car anyway"
"In another topic, I was trying to think of something that could describe Ti written and viewed by an ISTP in order to CLEARLY separate Ti from the usual Ti-Ne mental masturbation. From my point of view, Ti is too often associated with INTP, and it often leads to a huge misconception about Ti. 

The best example of ISTP Philosopher I had in mind was Miyamoto Musashi  (Japanese master swordsman, painter, and author.)

Example of Ti life rules (written by ISTP) :

The 21 precepts of Dokkodo ""The Way of Walking Alone"" : by Miyamoto Musashi

1. Accept everything just the way it is.
2. Do not seek pleasure for its own sake.
3. Do not, under any circumstances, depend on a partial feeling.
4. Think lightly of yourself and deeply of the world.
5. Be detached from desire your whole life long.
6. Do not regret what you have done.
7. Never be jealous.
8. Never let yourself be saddened by a separation.
9. Resentment and complaint are appropriate neither for oneself or others.
10. Do not let yourself be guided by the feeling of lust or love.
11. In all things have no preferences.
12. Be indifferent to where you live.
13. Do not pursue the taste of good food.
14. Do not hold on to possessions you no longer need.
15. Do not act following customary beliefs.
16. Do not collect weapons or practice with weapons beyond what is useful.
17. Do not fear death.
18. Do not seek to possess either goods or fiefs for your old age.
19. Respect Buddha and the gods without counting on their help.
20. You may abandon your own body but you must preserve your honour.
21. Never stray from the Way.​
The guy spent his life ""aimlessly"" traveling and ""recklessly killing"" people (/caricature) 
He wrote it one week before dying (~60 years old) and it more or less resume his lifestyle / internal rules. 

Even as an INTP (who prefers to brawl with abstact thoughts/concepts, and won't spend her life going into physical brawls). I think his Dokkodo ""The Way of Walking Alone"" represents Ti perfectly. Even the title is perfect. Of course, it doesn't mean that every Ti strong users has the same principles, but there are a lot of common points.

The rules are very short but they actually took a lifetime / life research to reach them. There's also the attachment to ""reach internal peace without being dependent of the external world, and without being strayed by feelings/desires/partiality/customary beliefs (=take neutral inputs)"". The need of independence is very strong.

I find this example very relevant. This clearly reeks of Ti-ness ""neutrality/impartiality"" with very very low chance to mistake it for Fi even though we're talking of life precepts and ""honor"". This also shows why Ti is often associated with :

- Rebellion (""Do not act following customary beliefs"" - ""Never stray from the Way."" Implied, just fuck off people trying to take control of you, and just do what's relevant.) 
- With being unemotional even though we do have feelings (""Do not, under any circumstances, depend on a partial feeling."")
- Being, very, very laid-back / with low will to control the outer world (""Accept everything just the way it is."")​
I personally find this text very inspiring.
Fellow INTPs, What do you think about that ? Do you recognize your Ti in this ? Or is it just me ? Thank you in advance for your inputs.


edit 1 : I'm NOT asking for a ""Ti definition"" discussion/debate. There are plenty of these on PerC. I'm asking you (Ti-dom/aux) if you recognize YOU in this, and if these principles speak to YOU specifically. So, no abstract/conceptual discussion and debates please, but more ""personal experiences and lifestyles sharing"" discussions. Thank you in advance for sticking on the thread's subject. 

edit 2 : If you have inspiring texts on the same subject you want to share, I would be more than happy to read them !"
"You go to Wikipedia to look up one thing and end up spending hours on the site reading.
You would download the Internet into your mind if you could.
You know more inside your head than you do on the outside.
You have a great idea, but you'll do it tomorrow.

Any others?"
"Shit I need help. I'm new to relationships because I only really became open to the possibility this year. But do any other INTPs have relationship issues. As in whenever you see the person or going to see the person youre in a relationship with, you get anxiety? 

I'm not good at any part of the relationship. I got anxiety so bad that I ended up having health problems because of my anxiety and stress levels reached a new high. 

Don't get me wrong- you like the person you're seeing. But something in you ends up thinking that relationships don't feel realistic. They feel like they don't belong with other forms of interaction and because of this sporadic variable, you don't feel in control. Do you guys have this?

Also, do you worry about wasting your time if it doesn't go right? 

I don't know how to control it. I feel fine when I'm with them, but I can feel the anxiety rising as time goes on. Especially after leaving them. 

But I know this is something I've got to get used to. I don't talk to many people at all. I don't have friends so this is a big step for me. Especially because the guy im seeing is an extrovert. 

If you INTPs have in fact experienced this, can you let me know how you got over it? Please not just time. It can be some sort of thought psychology that you had, some mentality. It can be actual physical methods. I don't care. Just anything."
"According to this  article  many INTPs are interested in photography. 
I'm just wondering if you would call yourself a photographer, and, if so, what type of pictures do you normally take?

To start it off, I would definitely call myself a photographer and I've been playing with cameras for the past 5 years. My favourite pictures to take are abstract minimalist macros with interesting colours, although normally each my photographs only manage to incorporate one or two of those ideas. I also enjoy experimenting with other types of photography, but I'm not often as happy with my work in those areas. Right now my camera is a Canon Rebel."
"Well, I've seen these threads on about 4 different forums, so I guess I'm stealing it from all those. Basically, post things that interest/entertain you (not that kind of entertainment....). I'm confident that my fellow INTPs will come up with some interesting things 

I'll start :
Interesting Mechanisms!








This one's used in watches for second hands!








This one was used in aircraft engines before turbines!








I don't even know what this one's for!








This one's used in sewing machines!








This one's called a constant velocity joint. What?








And finally, the Wankel engine. I don't even really think this one's physically possible.

So, INTPs, what turns you on?"
"Hi Cognitive Masters,

I'm looking for a little help organizing my cognitive functions. I'll post some details, hoping you can reach a conclusion:

Me self typing myself when learned about cognitive functions.


Me as a baby I cried everyday 
As a kid, always attached to my Gameboy and Pokémon games (sleep with GB in pockets)Wet the bed. Just want to play videogames, watch TV, or play baseball with neighbors?I hide behind my mom when I catch somebody's attention.

Me at School, more focused on playing baseball with friends or videogames than actual girls dating. So Shy I was unable to tell the girls I liked them. I was so reserved. Some crazy girls did me what they call sexual harassment: they grabbed my buttocks and yelled in class how in love they were with me (which, of course, was more to annoy me than to flirt with me).

Me at College, As soon as class finished, I reached home.

Me at Work,  I love to annoy a small group of people, but in a childishly offensive manner. I want to annoy you a little without offending you. If I don’t like you Ill just treat you polite.

I rebelled once again against my boss (I ignored him) and told his boss I would quit when I finished my duties. His boss sent me a meeting, and I declined, stating that it was not necessary to talk. This latter boss (3 levels above me in EVP level) sent me a meeting and told me he cancelled a meeting to speak with me, so I ended up lowering my anger and accepting the meeting. I prefer my subordinates to do the talking while I keep analyzing things and procrastinate a lot. I always crack a joke in the middle of a serious or non-serious topic (it took me longer to be promoted, though).

I hate politics and find it stupid when people prioritize high-ranking bosses over anyone else. I'm so much requested outside work hours so I prefer to turn off my work phone than accepting the call and tell them to fuck off. I don't talk that much. Just burst of time.

At home, I'm the oldest brother, so I try to behave more appropriately.

When out there alone, Im Reversed and  Don't show my goofiness unless I’m around close people.

Me in general:


When people yell at me, it drains me , and HP gets to 0. Loud noises and crowded places discharge me fast.
People don’t always know when I’m joking sarcastically or talking seriously.
I’m not an organized person.I try to avoid debates or discussions because something inside me wants to say something, but after that, I want out of the discussion because I'm a little anxious or get involved in the heat. I prefer to hear people debating.
My brain skips between thoughts on different topics instead of going in sequence. Ex: I'm writing a letter, but before I write the last part, I remember I need to fix a backend service for a colleague. I end up leaving the mail in draft and sending it days later.
People laugh when I make a mistake. They find me funny even when I'm not joking.
My brain absorbs every problem, even the ones I need to resolve, and I blame myself for the problem. Ex.: Mom is arguing with my brother; I must fix it. I tend not to look at problems, so my mind won't hurry to fix them.I am afraid of making a mistake, and when I do it, I feel ashamed, and it bothers me a lot.I say I don’t care about what others say or think about me, but I do a little. SSRI makes it easier to ignore.Overthinking is my best friend, and Benzos doesn’t like it.
I have periods when I'm social, fanciful, and impulsive. Those times are usually followed by quite a bit of downtime and quiet introspection.
I take things personally.I like to watch or listen to heated discussions, and sometimes I start them.
I'm not that into reading books; I'm more visual.
I try to read people's faces before trying to softly annoy them.People at work like to include me in interviews because ""I’m good at reading people.
""I hate authority and have had problems with people three levels up in the company where I work. Nothing disrespectful. Just when my emotions can no longer be held. I just exploded in a crazy, sarcastic way.
People seem to love me more than I love myself.
When I'm at the store I prefer to spend time looking for the thing that asking for help finding it unless I'm in a hurry.
I hate to be hurried.
I won’t ask for help when needed, but eventually will let my pride lose so minions can work on the boring part . Exception at work because I'm a manager.
I try to do everything by myself almost always, and subordinates’ complaints about me doing it at work
When at home and on weekends, I shut off the social button and close myself in my bubble
I hate super-crowded spaces and loud noises."
"I am an INFP who has recently become deeply acquainted with an INTP. I met him on Bumble a little over a month ago while he was passing through my town. We didn't get a chance to meet in person and have instigated a long distance connection and ongoing conversation. We speak over text and voice memo daily, for hours. I am confused about our dynamic and am seeking feedback your personal or observed experience on a) signs that an INTP is developing or has a romantic interest in someone vs experiencing a platonic connection; and b) your experience as an INTP if someone shared they had feelings for you and you didn't return those feelings (if it turned you off to a friendship entirely or if you were able to maintain a friendship after this). 

Some contextual information:

I find this person mesmerizing. I appreciate his mind, the way he assesses and analyzes things, his thoughtfulness, creativity, depth and sensitivity. He is, frankly, brilliant and amazing. He speaks to me constantly, all day for hours, asking me questions, engaging in deep intellectual conversations, expressing that he appreciates my intelligence and ""brilliance"".  He even compared me to Einstein (a compliment I am not sure I am deserving of, but which felt really nice, ha). It feels wonderful to connect with someone in such a deep manner and to be appreciated myself as more than just a ""dreamer"" and ""feeler"" (I do have a keen intellect and it is rare I can meet someone who is capable of probing the depths of the universe and psyche in a way that is satisfying and inspiring to me). 

I find myself developing feelings for this person and want to tread carefully. I do not want to get hurt and wonder if my affections are one-sided. I value this relationship and do not wish to potentially ruin it. I have a sense he is deeply shy and he has shared he is on the spectrum (I am as well). I do not wish to scare him away and potentially make things awkward if he doesn't share the same feelings or if he views this relationship as merely a deep platonic friendship.  

I have sought to be clear, stating that I like him and often reflecting how much I appreciate him, our connection, and that he makes my life better. His responses to these sorts of statements are often reflective (i.e., ""I appreciate you also"" , ""I feel the same"", or ""I find our sharing immensely rich, meaningful, and valuable"") and logical.  Sometimes, his responses are also disappointing (i.e, ""ditto"").  While these sorts of emotional statements are interspersed occasionally, the general tone of our conversations is usually intellectual, creative, and abstract. 

I am confused by some statements he has made. Once, he suggested we are a soul connection and stated he determined his intuition to visit my city was prompted by a cosmic call to meet me and connect with me. He then immediately followed this up with an explanation from quantum physics on gravity and frequency dynamics, which makes it decidedly less romantic and unclear if he was flirting or just stating a scientific fact. I can agree scientifically with the logic behind the statement, but it makes it confusing to know if he likes me or just views this as a deep connection governed by numinous universal properties (ha). 

I also shared with him that I liked him and he did not respond to this, instead following up a few days later with a statement that he believes we are in a supra-sexual relationship (i.e., a co-creative relationship that is of a higher-order, with creative and evolutionary purpose and potential rather than simple pro-creative biological potential). This could be either a display of affection or simply a factual statement of his experience of a deep platonic connection. I have also asked twice (about a month ago) if he wanted to talk over facetime, phone, or zoom and he did not respond to this, but recently asked me if I wanted to test a scientific protocol over zoom. This confused me. I don't understand why he would be open to a scientific test but not a conversation? 

So, there are somewhat mixed messages and I am confused. These is significant time investment being placed in this connection with me, he makes occasional statements reflecting his experience of a deep connection and appreciation for me, and states that he thinks of me and dreams about me; however, I experience a lack of clarity about how he feels about me and what he wants from this relationship or connection. 

Any thoughts or feedback you might have to offer is much appreciated. I am on the spectrum and miss cues sometimes. He is different from any other man I have met, which I really love, but this also feels unfamiliar and I do not have a template for which to nest this sort of experience inside of, which is why I am asking for some help. 

Thank you."
I was wondering what would be negative Ti - Si loop be like?
"I thought about how these 4 words have different meanings but are used interchangeably in every day informal speech/conversations.

I also wonder are you INTPs here intelligent, intellectual , sharp or crazy?

Here are my definitions:
An intelligent person is adaptable, always find solutions, and can simplify situations to quickly find a way to gain an advantage. An intelligent person can adapt to modern society and capitalism and find ways to secure themselves a comfortable spot in this society.
An intellectual is simply someone that wants to learn everything there is, or become an expert in some field. 
A sharp person could be neither intelligent or intellectual but they could simply be extremely perceptive when observing the world. They might be really good at coming to insights about people ,events and etc. without necessarily needing to read mountains of data. Unlike the intellectual they usually don't need books to gather knowledge. They simply observe, from a detached perspective, and learn by experience.
A crazy person is simply someone that thinks differently than anyone else and can give an impression of extreme intelligence because they can be inventive or can find loopholes in systems easily. This is someone that is completely not bound by rules and limitations of neurotypical minds, so they might come up with things no one would would think of, because most people are bound by the limitations of how their minds are programmed."
"The idea of eventually marrying or settling with someone makes me sick, for some reason. About the same feeling goes for finding a fixed job position and maintaining it. This is just my current state though.

At the same time, i wonder how feasible is it for anyone to not settle ever? I see being a free spirit as a very desirable condition, at least for me, until about 30-35. After that, i'm not sure. Again, the idea of settling, even at 40 or whatever, makes me sick, but at the same time i cannot help but wonder if one wouldn't start going mad after a certain age, or if there is a threshold age such that if you change idea after that, you most likely won't succeed at settling because it's simply too late and everyone is taken except for ludicrous people that nobody wants.

And even if you succeed, what if you then regret changing your mind? What if instead you didn't change your mind, but then regret not changing your mind?

I don't know, i'm confused. It seems to me there is no info about this. Everybody talks about marriage, having a steady job, settling for life, but nobody talks about living as a free spirit and thus we don't even know if it's an hard thing to do or how viable it is.

I would be most intrigued if there are any studies on this. How happy are, on average, those people who never settle? Do they even exist? I don't even know where to look.

Discuss."

"well for me anyway. Anyone else? I've not been able to make any of my traits into positives or put them to any good use. I wish I was another type. 
No doubt because I have chronic depression and anxiety.
Sucks!"
