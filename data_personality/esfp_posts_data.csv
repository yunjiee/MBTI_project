"I was perusing the ESFP thread and noticed a lack of stickied threads, then I felt like I would help out:happy:

I've only seen this in two other threads but both seemed to do fairly well, so... ask an ESFP a question!

I shall ask one right now, @Stephen might you sticky this thread perchance?

EDIT: 
and they need a photo thread sticky!
http://personalitycafe.com/esfp-forum-performers/100943-dis-my-face.html

DOUBLE EDIT: well... sticky if they want it stickied... don't want to be that guy... everyone that reads will know what I'm talking about lol."
"So.. I've been doing A LOT of research and have come to the conclusion that I am either an ISFP or an ESFP. I just got done reading the thread ""YOU KNOW YOUR AN ISFP WHEN"" but when I came over here... NOTHING! SOOOO... let's start one! :happy:

This way, I can compare more easily. And it will be fun!:tongue:"
"Did anyone here doubt/reject their type cause of negative stereotype? I have a friend who is an astrophysicist and scored esfp, I am an unsure of my type but recently scored esfp in one, I have always been super academic, have 2 college degrees and am in med school so I always assumed I had to be an NT like there was no other way.

 I am unsure of my type, I have gotten different responses but esfp keeps coming up when i do questionnaires etc. Guys, tell me the ways you are not the stereotype??"
"Let it out, bitches erc2:"
"Does it bother anyone else that ESFPs are generally the comic relief in fiction? Both books and movies alike. I might be biased, because I obviously look at my own more than any other MBTI type, but it seems to me, that if someone is shallow, irresponsible, and a kind smiley prankster, it means they are ESFP. There might be some characters, that are typed differently elsewhere, nevertheless...

Notably:
Homer Simpson - Simpsons
Philip Fry - Futurama
Joey Tribiani - Friends
Sookie St. James - Gilmore Girls
Serena    Vanderwoodsen - Gossip Girl
Jonathan    Carnahan - The Mummy
Samantha Jones - Sex and the City
Random Weasleys - Harry Potter

There are plenty.

I've actually found a list with a bazillion characters in fiction sorted by MBTI, and there are a couple better developed ones. Which well-developed ESFPs in fiction are your favorites?

This is the list: Character List - Funky MBTI in Fiction"
I would like to know what you guys think of the ESFPs.

We all know you like to look at yourself =P"
"Ah, yes. Another thread for the ESFP's. We already know what the personality description says about the ESFP, but how do people really see them? 

You have to be 100% honest. 
It does not matter if you are right or wrong. 
Both positive and negative comments appreciated. 

I tend to see most ESFP's as fun loving and easy going. They don't think before they do stuff; impulsive, but always entertaining. They usually know the right thing to say. They aren't that bright, but they've got such good people skills and good charisma that it doesn't matter. It's hard to connect with them on a deeper level, they don't seem to like talking about things that are more in-depth. They've got so many friends and so many people feel like they connect with the ESFP. ESFP's sometimes come off as shallow. They are always in the middle of the crowd. They like to have a good laugh. They don't mind being human lab rats for their friends latest idea or experiment. Overall, they are really cool people to talk to and be around. 

What is everyone else's input on the ESFP personality type? ™​"
I have severe depression and dealing with delayed grief. I'm not able to concentrate on anything. It becomes very difficult for mr to study. Nothing pleases me anymore. I wanna know how can I study with depression as ab ESFP. I can barely sit for half an hour as I get bored too easily and feel very hopeless and upset. I tried everything from therapies to journaling but nothing worked out. Tomorrow I have an exam I wanna know how can I study for long hours without getting bored or depressed.
Idk I just want someone to talk to..I'm feeling really depressed and negative
"Idk if this the right space to say it but I'm  also delaing with the same  I've major depression and dealing with suicidal thoughts lioe nearly everyday I feel suicidal I'm feeling everything negative nothing gives me joy anymore. I feel life has nothing to offer. Alot of bad stuff happened with me in the past that I'm still not able to get over with. I lost my mom last year due to cancer. Also I had some career issues in the past. Im not liking my current environment and not able to accept the changes around me. Everything feels dull. It feels like a major part of me is lost somewhere. I was diagnosed with adjustment disorder in the past. Also I've major depression. So I feel very agitated and irritated and impulsive. It feels like things arent going my way ,things are not happening in my favour.I still feel angry for whatever happened in my life. I'm not able to process th grief idk how do I go with life. I also tried therapies before but nothing worked out I lost all hope everything seems pointless to me. Life isn't making sense to me. Also I feel worthless and don't like myself. I did alot of mistakes in my past that i still regret alot. I feel no urge to live. I don't know but I don't feel any reason to live.I feel angry everyday and feel aggressive. Idk what to do?"
"I think I might be an ESFP because I'm highly impulsive and never think of the consequences of my actions, yet I'm quite introverted. I don't like most people (in fact I'm very selective with who I spend my time with due to being an sx-dom) and I have misanthropic tendencies. I have few friends. It could just be my autism, but can an ESFP be autistic as well?"
"I'm trying to see if there's any correlation! 

I think my sister is ESFP 6w7"
"I don't know about you guys but after extensive reading about ADD I can high relate to it and I'm wondering if it's common among ESFPs or just a personality thing.

I'm constantly doing things, I'm impatient, when a task or topic becomes boring I drop it and do some I enjoy, I'm horrible with school work that I find unnecessary and unhelpful and I end up not doing it. I use to get As and Bs during my fresh/soph year in high school, and now my junior year approached I have Cs - notably in my AP classes.

Thoughts?

btw - if you're curious about why I'm labeled as an ESTP, it's because the first few times I've taken the test, I've tested as ESTP. The third time, I was an ESFP, and other ESTPs on this forum has observed me as someone who uses my Feelings in consideration."
"I was called a snob today and I was rather taken aback by it. How can someone as pragmatic, terrestrial, humble and approachable as myself be declared a ""snob"" in front of my peers? I denied the accusation instantly, this person is clearly an imbecile. Maybe the imbecile is misinterpreting my extreme intelligence, witticism, majestic high-mindedness for snobbishness. Perhaps the imbecile is so mired in his own marshy soot to see that I am not a snob, but that he is the prole who is envious! Why should someone as gifted and inspirational as myself sink to the level of these proles so that I may be deemed a humble idiot like the rest? He is everything wrong with society today, the conformity to blind complaisance, the masses sinking into the lowest expectations, total mass stupidity."
"If you've ever interacted at length with other ESTPs - what were the main similarities and differences that you personally noticed between you?

I learn best by examples, do please enlighten me :crazy:"
"Dating an ESFP for almost two months has been challenging. But there's also psychological understanding and attraction between us so it isn't one-sided. When we talk about hobbies, arts, and places it can be extremely comfortable and enjoyable. However, I'm not truly sure if this young man wants to be serious with me. We are only in our early twenties and I don't have that much experience in the dating world except with this young ESFP who has at least 5 lovers before me. He told me that he wanted to consider me as his wife unless I fulfilled his criteria which obviously has to be about looks and body. I told him that these are superficial things and that in the end, looks will merely fade. I understand it can be an important factor especially if he is truly visual and I'm sure even without me, he can get another lady if he desires to. If he had someone with whom he went out before and he is comparing me with those women, then I just don't understand the idea of him being with me if he knows I can't satisfy his wishes sometimes. If I can recall, at least we clashed but manage to forgive each other until there will be another conflict...if we are already like this during dating, I don't know if marriage is the best solution since it won't be the same. Usually, dating is supposed to be easier, I thought. Well, not in this relationship lol. I was anticipating this relationship to last long term and I know I shouldn't expect anything too much, but after going through hardships I had a chance to move on and not fall for another heartbreak. If marriage is uttered in his tongue, I believe he wants to respect me and be frank about the situation. So, I'm not sure why he always cancels our plan if we want to have a date and talk about serious matters.

Oh, I don't know. We'll see."
"Hi ESFPs,

So I have this close guy friend who is an ESFP. Tbh, I put him on decent attractiveness level, he has a steady career in IT (not crazy money but not broke either), he's friendly, personable, basically I'm just getting all the superficial stuff out of the way to make him not seem like a repulsive bum in any way that a girl wouldn't consider him.

He has this one ex, let's call her C (which we will get to later) who he dated maybe 4 years ago and can't stop romanticizing her.

However, in the course of that breakup up until now he has tried to date maybe 5 girls who he became absolutely infatuated with very early into getting to know them and they all refused to commit to him because he seemed ""too much"" for them. He would become extremely clingy, needy, and put these girls on a pedestal before they could even determine their true feelings towards him. Basically, doing boyfriend things without actually being their boyfriend. I told him to stop doing this until the girl earns your love, but he just can't seem to help himself once he feels an attraction towards her. I don't want to be sexist here, but I can see this behavior being more tolerable I guess as a female trait but it kind of is frowned upon coming from a guy. He would then be left absolutely demoralized and feel ""used"" for all the love and attention he gave them only to not receive it back. I personally see this as illogical since on the girl's end, she didn't even say she was ready for all this attention when they were merely just trying to get to know him during this time. 

Fast forward to present time, he's now pretty cynical when it comes to love. He refuses to get close to women. He won't even go with the flow and sleep around/have fun because he's afraid of repeating his mistakes. He just pictures himself choosing the wrong girl, getting hurt again, and doesn't even bother pursuing anybody - it's been like this for almost a year now.

Going back go his ex, C. He will occasionally think about her or have dreams about her and have it ruin his mood all day because of it. It seems like he views her as the ""girl who got away"" and can't seem to move past it even though that can no longer be rekindled. It seems like he keeps comparing himself to what he used to have and who he used to be with her and compare it to how he doesn't have that right now and then beats himself over it.

For all the ESFP guys on here or even girls who have had this issue, is this relatable to you? Also, how have you dealt with trying to tone down your emotions and know when to give to someone your time/love vs knowing when it's the wrong time. ESFPs are super sweet don't get me wrong they make absolutely amazing supportive friends who are always down to have a good time, however I can see how their Se-Fi, when not curbed correctly, can be put into absolute override and become overwhelming to the person on the receiving end. Please I really want to offer some advice to him to get over this hump but as an INTJ, I feel like the solutions and advice I give him might just be a little too logical for him to relate to... If you guys can give me some sort of insight that will resonate with him or a comparable story and how you personally got through it, it would be incredibly helpful. Thanks!"
"Never mind just delete this post, i overesmiated myself and no one would read such a long post."
"During the school year I have been unofficially tutoring one of the elementary students that live in my neighborhood. I've typed her as an ESFP. I could use some advice on discipline and/or motivation in light of some recent problems. For context, I am an INFP and am doing this in a friendly, neighborly kind of way. Sorry for the long post. Will highlight the key points. So here are the issues:

ACADEMIC

She is now in the 4th grade, but reads at the 1st grade level. (Her parents do not speak English, so I suspect that in the early years a lack of attention to fundamental phonics has played a role.)
She cannot sound words out very well, and usually just guesses words based on whatever the first letter is. (For example she would see the word ""Basement"" and say ""Basketball""). English spelling is notoriously inconsistent, but hers is downright atrocious. It pains me to see her ask for spelling to simple words like ""where.""
She has very poor focus and usually cannot finish one question without going off on a tangent based on whatever random idea or memory has popped into her head. I have resorted to using a timer to add pressure for her to keep working. A worksheet that should take no more than 30 minutes takes nearly an hour and a half to complete. She is a fun-loving child, so I sometimes indulge her in her little side convos.
During reading comprehension / multiple choice answers, she goes down the line guessing which answer may be correct, looking at my facial expression to gauge.


BEHAVIORAL

She is extremely sensitive to criticism and downright avoidant. I offer praise whenever she tries and answers things correctly, but occasionally I will mention a systemic problem to her, and she becomes defensive. She will do anything not to hear criticism, including suddenly needing a drink of water, needing to go to the bathroom, changing the subject, etc.
Sometimes I let her do arts and crafts at my house. She has become so entitled to my art supplies that she thinks she needs to leave my house with a ""gift"" every time she visits. This includes her constantly asking can she have markers or cute knick knacks she finds around my home. I have a pile of paper that I reserve for little drawings and random notes. She asks if she can take two sheets home. I say yes. 5 minutes later she wants two more sheets. It's almost opportunistic, like she feels she has to constantly finagle more. I have resorted to saying no more and more these days as I truly want her to understand that just because something is cute, does not mean that you are entitled to it.
She is a sweet girl, really values her friendships and playing. She never runs out of energy to play. The problem is, no matter how much I give, it's never enough. Recently she asked if she could come over my house every day after school, and on the days that I am busy if I can call her and tell her that I have something else to do and let her know what is the something else. Woops! She (and possibly her parents at this point) are stepping into dangerous territory. I'm a freedom-loving INFP, I don't feel a need to be ""busy."" Just the simple fact that I am an unpaid volunteer and she is not my child is enough for me to pump the brakes on that. I don't care if I have no plans at all. I would never willingly schedule away my personal time every weeknight for the entire school year. Furthermore, she takes this kind of social rejection personally and starts to feel unloved. In this case, I will notice her ""retaliating"" by acting cold or playing dumb while saying intentionally hurtful things.

This post has gotten long now, but if anyone has any ideas, tips, or tricks about any part of it, please let me know. I feel myself growing resentful, which isn't a good relationship dynamic for a child. If she were an adult, I would start my INFP slow fade, but she is very young. And I think some behaviors can be corrected with insight."
"First of all, if you're about to post ""you're a typist!"" go away, it won't help anybody.

Observations:
I see ESFPs as pot-smoking guys who don't care about anything but their friends and themselves. In their 20s, they may start to care about things like corporations and the government or other ""righteous"" things. They love to party, preferably with their friends, a close group of friends or their friends, but don't mind strangers. Partying sometimes includes other drugs rather than weed, combined with lots and lots of alcohol. Likely to be smokers as they wanted to be cool. Generous, would share a chocolate that costs $50/kg that he just got from his grandma overseas with a friend's friend just because he's there with him at that moment. Can't be trusted to do something they promise, likely to just forget it. May even skip a class because they forgot about it, or a driving lesson, even if it costs $200 to retake it and they don't have it. Don't know if the following is country-specific, but: don't like to work, unless it's illegal and relatively easy. Very impulsive, prefer to set ""schedule"" 15 minutes before it happens, an hour tops. Oddly, when young seem to want some kind of fame, but that may be mistaken for the wish to be accepted. Due to their social skills and rather charming personality, some may consider them a leader, assuming it's a group of friends. Always have a story to tell, whether their own or someone else's. Often it's someone else's though. Pay attention to the stories of others, if it's happened to someone else, it's the truth. Sort people into respected and disrespected, depending on how their interests match. Have a moral code, once an ESFP even gave back what he stole from a guy in an online game because he felt bad about it. Loves animals, may stop and pet a stray dog or a cat on the street. Don't mind stuff that may harm them, ""life is short, live good, die young"" kinda folks. Don't mind getting ""lost"" in thought when doing something, so concentration skills. When under stress may be violent or do immoral stuff, like stealing from the less respected friends or insulting them. Don't mind making fun of friends or others as long as it's between friends. Neglect any logical discussion unless it's one-on-one. A partner leaving them may cause great stress that can last even for a month or a bit more and may lead into more-than-usual drug abuse. Don't like talking about love or romance, especially if it's related to them. May annoy the hell out of an ENTJ by asking countless ""why?"" questions about stuff that I see as intuitive and if I take the time to explain it, may just stick a ""too serious"" sticker on it. Great activity partners - gaming, whether computer or real-world and sports.

I bet that part of the observations are either generalizations or unrelated, so feel free to comment or post your observations and discuss."
"Just need some perspective… 

My coworker at my new job is an ESFP (22F) and she happened to train me (18F) on my first day. 

We actually had a lot in common and she was so helpful and I could tell she genuinely wanted to make me comfortable 

Me being overly sensitive shy, I anticipated my first day being stressful and She always assures me to not overthink things. She’s been there for every mistake I made, and tries to make me feel better after each time 

I thought she was cute,  the second I saw her but didn’t think she liked girls so I wasn’t pursuing. The same day, I heard her checking out and complimenting someone’s girlfriend , freely

Still I fell back because I was the new girl and didn’t wanna seem  distracted or overbearing. She was surprised I was 18 and told me that I carried myself well so I wanted to keep that calm demeanor 

I knew I had a crush but wanted to tone it down because I felt a pressure at work and would make many mistakes and just feel anxious and overthink the entire time. 

She knows I’m shy and sometimes I felt hurt whenever she doesn’t initiate convos and talks to others. I  don’t initiate and I feel jealous when others spend a long time with her because she is so social

Also sometimes she purposely ignores me, (I’ve seen her do this to others). I think she does this when stressed or feels controlled. 

I want to see this ESFP as a friend bc she is the closest co worker I have, and the most understanding of my personality. My feelings get hurt often and don’t want it to hurt my friendship bc I NEED friends at work Lol and she’s great.

I do think she’s attracted to me because ever since training she became touchy feely. (She regularly would play with my hair, place her hand on my back or try to touch hands or arms.) this basically happens every shift we are together , I am very aware of body language and notice  she always tries to get closer to me.  I don’t initiate physical touch but she always comes to the host stand leans over on her phone, and will stay there touching my arm.(she’ll stop if  I don’t reciprocate )l Also I catch her staring at me sometimes bc I am always in a daze looking at nothing but can feel when someone is looking at me 

She’s called me every pet name -I think she’s most positive towards me

She also shows me she cares. She reiterates my bday or facts about me (if relevant to convo.) She splits easy tasks with me so I won’t be bored and can hang out w her. She over communicates , directly and honestly asking me why I don’t talk, initiate convos or socialize with others. She says we’re different and that’s ok. 

Times I have been off putting to her (trying to protect my feelings) she still tries to talk and then I feel bad. 

I’ve grown attached bc she’s made an strong effort to get to know and befriend me. Now I can’t get over the flirtatiousness

For a fact, she knows I like her. I’ve acted too clumsy too nervous far too many times- anyone with a brain could tell. 

But she played on it or teased me , instead or being annoyed or awkward it was always entertaining to her. 

I love that she cares about me but I hate that she is not 100% aware of my feelings while flirting with me 

It’s like she’s there one second and then she’s gone. I think she enjoys the attention while enjoying the friendship because it’s not like I’m starting the flirtation shes verbatim told me “I am trying to get a reaction out of you” (referring to playing w my hair.) 

Thought on my conclusion? Like I said, I really think she’s a good person but cannot stand the thought of my feelings as her entertainment whether she likes me or not. 

I don’t fully blame her, she probably thinks I don’t take the feelings I try to hide seriously and that I enjoy the flirting as much as her
Honestly it’s a painfully redundant cycle"
"Hello ESFPs! In this interview, I talked to Tiana and Jany about their similarities and differences as standard and jumper ESFPs. This was honestly one if not my most favourite ESFP interview yet. We started the interview by talking about their most significant difference where Tiana (standard ESFP) is self above tribe while Jany (jumper ESFP) is tribe above self. Jany had the quote of the day when she released an explosive double masculine sleep last rant between the 8-minute to 8:45 minute mark of the interview. Another great takeaway from the interview is Tiana being double introverted feels like she's letting other people down with the demon Te while Jany feels like she's letting herself down with demon Fi. It was also interesting that what made them happy was completely opposite. For Jany who is a double extrovert, happiness to her is alone time being introspective or doing what she loves. For Tiana, it's using her blast and being productive since she is blast last. I also learned that one of the most important things when talking to ESFPs is getting to their core because outside their Se lead is that deep NF sleep. Watch this interview here:"
"Hello ESFPs! In this interview, I got a chance to talk to Jonathan about what it's like to be an ESFP Se-Te PC/S(B) MF. The first thing we talked about is Jonathan's belief that we should all be equal and the whole talk about race is getting in the way of bigger life problems. We spent some time talking about racism, especially since we are both minorities, and experiencing it in North America. Jonathan talked about doing a pilgrimage to West Africa where his ancestral roots were and he said he loved the feeling of blending in with everyone and people wanting to get to know him for him instead of his race. He did mention one funny thing that people still knew he was American because he said when he went there, he was fat. We then talked about other issues that he perceived as bigger problems such as the economy. Jonathan talked about his background in sports and fitness and how he would use his energy dominant goofiness to engage his clients. He said he has trouble with the NT blast and doesn't feel comfortable using it even if he has a degree in Sports Science. We finished up the interview talking about him being audio and kinaesthetic. Watch this interview here:"
"My mom is ESFP and the only time when she tells a lie is when she is trying to protect herself from revealing too much personal information, other times she's quite honest and spontaneous and blunt about things. Even when telling jokes, it tends to be on the ironic-side of things. Does this stem from being a Se-dom & Ni-inferior? Any other explanations you can think of?"
"I read that ESFPs dislike reading. Is that ALWAYS true? Or are there ESFPs who LIKE to read? I'm asking because somebody thinks my personality type is ESFP (but I don't usually act like it because bad stuff happened and my parents are autistic) but I've loved reading ever since I figured out how to read when I was four. I also read that they don't like science fiction, but I really like Doctor Who. None of this was in the description of ESFP on 16 Personalities. Is it true? Sorry if this is the wrong section."
"I have an ESFP son (5yrs old).

Just wanting to raise him well, or to discipline him well in a way that doesn't invoke bitterness yet still get him to behave. 

He's a very lively fun loving boy who laughs a lot and can be rather careless at time. He's also rather conscientious too. (I find this common among ESFPs, they're all fun, but they have this hidden prickly/diligence (Fi/Te) that surprises you.) Despite his conscientiousness, he can still misbehave, or fail to listen over and over.

When I'm overly soft, he seems to be more affectionate and be all ""I love daddy so much!"" - and I wonder if I'm being too soft and so when I tell him off for his misbehaving, he can be rather bitter or rude. Then I wonder if I'm being too hard? So I'm finding it a bit tricky.

Currently, I basically try to adhere to the principles in the ""Whole Brain Child"" book by Dr Daniel Siegel. And it seems to be helpful. Which is basically to calm them down first, address the issue when they're calm, empathize, see their point of view. Redirect the behavior. (kind of talk it out). And I don't think I execute it perfectly. Sometimes I get annoyed/angry  and raise my voice.

Any tips from ESFPs? How would ESFPs want to be parented that would result in good mature behavior AND still not invoke bitterness - maintain good child/father relationship in the long run?"
"HELP HELP HELP!
I desperately need help dealing with a manipulative ESFP in my life.
To start off:
I am an ENTJ and he is an ESFP.
I'm not sure how to handle the situation because I haven't figured out ESFP's yet 
I'd love the point of view of an ESFP!

His motto seems to be, ""I don't trust I will get what I need, so I will give myself every advantage.""

He has manipulated me to the point where he controls everything I do.
He believes he has total control over me. (which he does)
He believes I will do whatever he wants, if he asks the right way. (which is true)
Nothing I do is good enough for him.
I am never acknowledged when I please him either.
PLUS he's cheated on me multiple times. (but I can't reveal my sources so I was never able to confront him about it) 

But sadly, I'm still attracted to him. You are all too charming and I always fall for this type 
He knew I wanted someone to care about me and he faked it to get what he wanted out of me.
Thankfully I've realized that he is not healthy for me.

I WANT OUT!
I've tried to leave many times.
I cut off all communication with him.
That led to begging and pleading.
When I didn't give in, he resorted to emotional blackmail.
He just makes me feel as if I am obligated to stay with him. And it works.
Which obviously drew me back in. And now I am stuck. I'm just going in a circle.
I've tried to buy as much time as possible but enough is enough for me.
Its as if he's saying, ""You're no good, but I'll do everything in my power to keep you in my life.""

I realize I am only adding to the fire when I respond to him, but not responding clearly didn't work.
I am the type to be super direct and confrontational. I explain why I am doing certain things and how it will be beneficial to the both of us. He is only worried about what will make him happy right now. So everything I tell him goes in through one ear and out the other.

SO MY QUESTION TO ALL YOU ESFP's OUT THERE:
In a perfect world, how would YOU like to be dumped?
I know it's a strange question, but think about it.
A way that would stop you from contacting me continuously and still feel satisfied with the end of the relationship?PLEASE HELP ME!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I really appreciate it! Is anyone willing to share their experience? How they got out of a manipulative relationship?
I'd love to know how you did it!!

THERE MUST BE A FORMULA OF SOME TYPE.
SOME WAY TO GET RID OF HIM.

For some reason I've involved my emotions for the first time in my life.
This is one situation I CAN'T get myself out of.
I hate feelings. Ugh.

Thank you thank you!"
"Hello ESFPs! In this interview, I got a chance to talk to Erin about what it's like to be an ESFP Se-Te PB/S(C) FF. Erin is the rare consume last ExxP and it's clear to have some benefits and disadvantages as a result. The advantage would be that she is a production and teaching machine which helps her career. The downside is that she becomes disconnected from her emotions and while she can execute, she might be working on the wrong field or wrong life direction. This proved to be the case as we discussed her divorce, lack of planning, and self-neglect as a result of not using her Fi and her Ni more often. The conclusion we came up with was still positive as Erin, at the very least, is aware of her problems and knows where to start to troubleshoot and figure out how to be better in touch with her emotions and focus more on her inner world so she can do things in life that brings her joy instead of unhappiness. Watch this interview here:"
"Not a very active forum. I hope this gets responses anyhow.
And I do mean ""relationships"" as in friend or potentially more. Any type of relationship dynamics between these types.
So I've been talking to this ESFP online and so far I find him really intriguing. He's only taken one MBTI test, and from what he says it's mostly accurate. He's older, single dad, so life has taken over for him. So far I actually like him and we have good conversations, but some of the things I've read about ESFP's, like their avoidance of problems, that concern me. Being an INTP, subjects such as problem solving are areas I spend most of my time and frankly I enjoy facing problems head on and using those involved to help me come to a good solution.
I'd like to know if anyone here has had experience with INTP's and how that dynamic worked."
"Hi, I wanted to ask you guys if you know of the evil side of esfp's. Generally I've been called bubbly, cute, entertaining and my sister even says I have a personality of Cinderella's godmother...lol. I admit I'm happier when I make other ppl happy. I'm good with troubleshooting and all. But I do feel we esfp's have a dark side. It can't be just attention seeking. We have a stereotype of being dumb...which I feel shows the irrationality of the person judging us. We ar pretty smart. Do any of you know any esfp's with a dark side or for u esfps out there, can u think of anything u find within urself? just curious."
"An ESFP blurted out he loved me 3 weeks into us dating. I didn't know what to say. I was kind of shocked. And I said, ""WHAT DO YOU MEAN?! YOU CAN'T JUST JOKE ABOUT STUFF LIKE THAT."" To which he immediately retracted it and said, ""I meant-- as a person. I love you as a person."" But I'm pretty intuitive and I felt like he actually meant it. So now I'm curious, do you ESFPs just fall hard and fast?!

He's told me he's never felt like this way about anyone-- he said to me I'm literally everything he's ever wanted, and he can't believe I exist. Is this normal for an ESFP? Do you all just feel this intensely for everyone you're into?!"
"***NOTE***
I had posted this a few months ago on the ISFJ forum, however I didnt get as much feedback as I would have liked, so I thought I would post it here too! 


This is directed at any other Male ISFJ's on this forum, or any female ESFP's that have been in this situation... 
Have any of you ever been in relationships with a female ESFP/male ISFJ?  I, for one have been in relationships with more than one Female ESFP  and neither of them have worked out. I've always felt like female ESFPs  have been drawn to me, although I'm not quite sure why.
At first, I always seem to connect magnificantly with the female esfp.
There warm, bubbly, fun loving personality usually puts me at ease and really  helps me be myself, and at first I really find myself enjoying spending  time with the ESFP and generally connecting wonderfully on an emotional level.

But ofcourse, as time goes on, it always becomes more and more apparant  that things arent going to work out. I become to needy, paranoid,  controlling and serious. Especially if the ESFP I'm in a relationship  with likes to flirt a bit with other guys. ESFPs like to be spontanious  and ISFJs like to plan, that is usually another problem.

I have also found that ESFPs cannot take the slightest bit of criticism. 
Even if its constructive they view it as a personal attack on their  character, there emotional outburts are really hard to deal with. 
Although being an ISFJ, I am also guilty of outbursts of anger.

I'm just wondering if there are any other Male ISFJs out there that have  been in relationships, or have found themselves drawn to Female ESFPs.  Or anyone who can help shed some light on to why things just didn't work  out. 
I get on really well with a healthy ESFP and I was wondering if there is anything I can do to make a relationship with them WORK?!

What's the secret to making a healthy female ESFP happy?

Thanks x"
"Hello everyone! In this interview, I got a chance to talk to all the ExxP types about their differences and similarities. During the discussion, we discussed what causes ExxPs to feel anxious and how that feeling manifests in their bodies. We also talked about the ExxP's IxxJ swing and what that looks like for each individual ExxP type. It turns out that ExxPs also don't like chaos and like to control things in their life. The only difference is when chaos happens or plans get ruined, the ExxPs can easily pivot to other plans or feel calm when chaos hits. Next, the ExxPs discuss their issues with over-gathering and what that looks like based on their type. This part of the discussion was interesting because each type tends to over-gather something completely different ranging from physical objects to information to values. We also touched on double observing or the lack of teaching/doing after consuming new information. This leads us talking to the differences between info-dominant and energy-dominant ExxPs. We then touched on ""people problems"" as an ExxP and what that looks like. And finally, we discussed Ti being annoyed at Ti and Fi being annoyed at Fe and even Fe being annoyed at Fe. Panel members were: Jany (ESFP Se-Te PB/C(S) FF), Tiana (ESFP Se-Fi CS/P(B) FF), Shane (ESTP Se-Ti CP/B(S) MM), Ian (ESTP Se-Fe PC/S(B) FF), Jacob (ENTP Ne-Fe PC/S(B) FF), Jake (ENTP Ne-Ti CP/S(B) MM), Annie (ENFP Ne-Fi CS/B(P) MF), Ashli (ENFP Ne-Te PC/B(S) FM) for the first hour and me (ENFP Ne-Te PB/C(S) MF) for the second hour.

"How ESFP (SeFx) uses valued Se (slot 1), Fi (2), Te (5), Ni (6), & unvalued Fe (3), Si (4), Ne (7), and Ti (8)."
"Hello ESFPs! In this interview, I got a chance to talk to Andreas about what it's like to be an ESFP Se-Fi CS/P(B) FF. We started the interview talking about his Ni and how hard planning is for him. Then, we discussed the issue with being blast last and being consume and sleep saviour and how often times, he just can't be bothered to do something. Committing to plans becomes a challenge this specific type because of the indecisiveness of being CS and blast last. The only time Andreas said he can commit quickly if it's something he really wants to consume badly like a good movie or food or shopping. However, when it comes to hanging out with people, it gets put in the maybe but not sure category until closer to the date. Andreas said he's always waiting to see if something better comes up. We also talked about productivity and I asked him if he often times feels like he could be more productive. Andreas revealed that he thinks about it a lot but still can't get himself to get started on doing the productive thing. He said he's been trying to get things done before the deadline recently and he's starting small like with his car repairs. Watch this interview here:"
"ESFP's International?

What country do you think they live in? :ball:"
"Hello ESFPs! In this video, I talked to Benjamin about what it's like to be an ESFP Se-Fi CP/B(S) FF. Benjamin talked about his life as an ESFP and having trouble using his Ni properly to make life decisions. Instead, he gets stuck channel changing multiple times which actually hurt him. Benjamin talked about changing majors while going to school which hurt him badly because of mounting student loans without completing any degrees or diplomas. Eventually, Benjamin joined the military which I think gave his life some stability. Benjamin also talked about his masculine Ni and how if he makes a long term decision, it feels like it's set, that it cannot be moved. We discussed how because he is an ExxP, he can pivot if that life decision doesn't pan out which shouldn't be the most difficult thing for him. We also talked about the ExxP addiction to gathering which we both shared and how it's important to budget in ""gathering new experience money"" and not going over that budget. That way, we can keep the gathering addiction monster at bay while we work on being more disciplined. Finally, we talked about tester and visual and Benjamin talked about his obsession with smelling things first hand just to find out what they really smell like. Watch this interview here:"
"As the title says, does ESFP want you to go through the same things as you put them trough?"
"I am an ISTJ (occasionally ISFJ) and I have known an ESFP for a few years. I want to be with him. He experiences highs (energetic, confident, fun, social, likeable) and lows (anxiety attacks, stress, bored easily, feeling like a failure, upset when criticized, catastrophises, histrionic).

We are not in a relationship and we see each other every few months. He works in a different country. Sometimes he comes back to my country to visit his family and sometimes I visit that country because I have siblings there. 

We get along really well and have been friends for a long time. We speak every day and he says I'm the closest to him. We admitted we had feelings for each other and he said he wants to be with me. However he has no plans to move to my country. I often think about moving but he told me not to move country to only be with him because it's too much pressure. I understand and I agree with him. However we will not magically be in the same country unless we make a decision and plan. He says he hopes we end up together in the future.

My question is in two parts:

1) He tells me every day that he misses me, he wishes I was there etc, he makes up scenarios where we are living together and he jokes about marrying me and meeting his family. I honestly don't understand why he says these things if he has no intention of us being together. Is it a joke? Does he actually want these things? Does he say it because he's bored and can easily say it to any other girl? Should I tell him to stop saying those things if they aren't true? But if I restrict him I worry his feelings would fade if he can't share with me his daydreams and feelings. Should I let him continue so that his feelings grow for me and eventually he will really make plans to be together?

2) When I do talk to him about more practical things, such as his plans for us being together, when we are next booking flights to see each other, that I'm willing to relocate for him etc, he disappears for days (very strange when we speak daily). Sometimes he gets back in contact to tell me I'm stressing him out, or sometimes I get back in contact with him and try to be light hearted and say sorry for making things serious, then we resume our normal fun, sweet conversation where he tells me he misses me and wants me there. But it's very annoying because I think I can't rely on him when things get tough and he's going to disappear each time he feels like I'm hinting at commitment. How can you communicate to an ESFP who wants you but doesn't make plans to be with you? I ultimately want to end up with him."
"Hello ESFPs! In this interview, I got a chance to talk to Jaxson about what it's like to be an ESFP Se-Fi CP/B(S) MF. First, Jaxson started the interview by talking about his uncontrollable consume and gathering. It's so bad that when he gets what he wants, he has trouble appreciating it and wants to get the next bigger and better thing. Recently, he's been working hard at buying a home and he's getting a sense of deep appreciation for the work it took to be able to get one. He came to realize that the journey to get something can sometimes be more rewarding than having the thing itself. Jaxson also talked about his fear of the abstract and talked about believing in vampires and werewolves. He also talked about fearing the nefarious Ni plan where someone can trap him somewhere. He talked about watching a movie about a cult that traps people only to hack them up and he's truly scared that these kinds of things do exist in real life. Jaxson said he is going to work on his NF sleep last moving forward. Watch this interview here:"
"Hello ESFPs! In this interview, I got a chance to talk to Jaclyn about what it's like to be an ESFP Se-Te PC/B(S) MM. During the interview, Jaclyn talked about her masculine Se and gathering facts and combined with her kinesthetic sexual modalities, also like hitting a punching bag. She also said that her double masculine ST play makes her unable to say no at work even if she is already burdened with too many tasks and she just soldiers on and gets it done. With her SF consume, she tends to be paranoid of hotels and checks to make sure everything is clean from coffee makers to bedsheets, pillowcases, etc. Jaclyn also talked about her feminine Fi and how when she was young, she could tell she wasn't like the other girls but despite that, she still felt very feminine inside regardless. Jaclyn also talked about her difficulties with Ni and while she has some use of her NT blast, the NF sleep is a challenging area for sure. Watch this interview here:"
"Hello ESFPs! In this interview, I got a chance to talk to Candice about what it's like to be an ESFP Se-Te PB/S(C) FF. One of the questions I asked Candice is what it's like to be the rare consume last ESFP having double activated Ni and double activated blast. She said she did notice she has trouble trying new things unless she gets pressure from the tribe. Candice's blast is apparent when she talks about being a serial entrepreneur and having sold a business before and loves starting new ones. She's a doer having saviour ST play and double activated blast. Candice also talks about her double feminine play to double masculine sleep swing. She will be nice and flexible with people but the feeling of resentment starts building up and she ends up blowing up on people. The analogy I used is like taking a can of pop and shaking it until it blows up when someone opens it a little. Candice also talked about having trouble planning with her Ni at the bottom (even if it's double activated) and talks about her fear of ghosts and being alone. Watch this interview here:"
